15,this is amazing this couple is on the,ep001
18,hunt for a house in Spokane but they,ep001
21,have completely different tastes I'm a,ep001
24,fan of formal living rooms even though,ep001
27,he really could care she was kind of,ep001
30,like a waste of space to me just keep a,ep001
33,fireplace right in the middle of your,ep001
36,kitchen why not there is one thing they,ep001
39,do agree on right the views from here,ep001
42,that's gorgeous in here right yeah you,ep001
45,can't beat this but in their price range,ep001
48,getting a house with a view may mean,ep001
51,putting up with some very quirky details,ep001
54,there's a urinal I think having a,ep001
57,putting green in your backyard is,ep001
60,awesome,ep001
63,oh my gosh honey these spores remind me,ep001
66,of Aunt Ruth's house it's interesting,ep001
69,[Music],ep001
72,swim back to us as fast as you can I'm,ep001
75,Danielle and I'm Ethan I'm a land,ep001
78,manager and a part-time fitness,ep001
81,instructor and I'm a manager at a,ep001
84,building products distribution company,ep001
87,can you get her covered up here we also,ep001
90,have a son seven years olds name is,ep001
93,Beckett and we have a daughter NOLA and,ep001
96,she is 5 years old we're coming up on,ep001
99,our 10-year wedding anniversary soon,ep001
102,Ethan is a very smart guy he's the type,ep001
105,that sits back and observes before he,ep001
108,says anything but then once he gets to,ep001
111,know you he really opens up danielle has,ep001
114,a very big personality does things in a,ep001
117,grand way a lot of enthusiasm and,ep001
120,excitement buddy,ep001
123,about three years ago we moved from,ep001
126,Colorado Springs to Castle Rock Colorado,ep001
129,which is just right outside of Denver,ep001
132,and we found a home there that we really,ep001
135,thought was our forever home it was a,ep001
138,wonderful home we did a lot of work to,ep001
141,it last year we just put in a big huge,ep001
144,deck with a slide coming off of it and,ep001
147,the kids and everybody all the neighbors,ep001
150,would come over and play on it and we,ep001
153,loved it but then Ethan's company,ep001
156,offered him a promotion only they would,ep001
159,have to move the family to Spokane so we,ep001
162,decided to leave our home in Colorado,ep001
165,and then try it out here right now we're,ep001
168,staying in a rented condo in the Spokane,ep001
171,area we seem to like it it's it's,ep001
174,similar climates Colorado there's,ep001
177,mountains there's sunshine there's lakes,ep001
180,I like the idea that when we want to do,ep001
183,things in this town it's a little bit,ep001
186,more accessible a bit of a smaller town,ep001
189,here in Spokane smaller city doesn't,ep001
192,take you three hours to go to a football,ep001
195,game go into the lake in Colorado is a,ep001
198,three or four hour ordeal drive let's,ep001
201,get to the lake and Spokane is 12,ep001
204,minutes right down the road all that's,ep001
207,left now is for them to buy a house in,ep001
210,their new city our budget for our new,ep001
213,"home we're looking at about $600,000 I'd",ep001
216,like to keep it closer to around five,ep001
219,I'm sure that I'm gonna want to change,ep001
222,something in the house and I'd like to,ep001
225,leave room in the budget to be able to,ep001
228,make those changes I'm up for making,ep001
231,some changes I work with a lot of,ep001
234,interior building products for my job so,ep001
237,I've got a an eye for those kind of,ep001
240,things helping them with their searches,ep001
243,real estate agent Nicole and race,ep001
246,what kind of style are you guys looking,ep001
249,for style of house I'm looking for is a,ep001
252,ranch-style home I like to have a main,ep001
255,living area then your basement you can,ep001
258,have for entertaining I'm not a fan of,ep001
261,the ranch houses I am a fan of a,ep001
264,Craftsman two-story home that has a lot,ep001
267,of light high ceilings in the family,ep001
270,room area are in the entry level,ep001
273,I don't like it closed off by like an,ep001
276,open floor plan no I think all we really,ep001
279,"need it's 3,000 square feet you don't",ep001
282,want to too big of a house I think,ep001
285,"there's enough room 3,000 square feet",ep001
288,that we can get our four bedrooms and,ep001
291,three baths I think we're gonna need,ep001
294,more the way I see it is our kids are,ep001
297,very close in age and as they grow up,ep001
300,what seems like a big house now might,ep001
303,not seem so big when you have the,ep001
306,cheerleaders and the football team all,ep001
309,over at our house at the same time right,ep001
312,but we don't need a formal living room,ep001
315,we don't need a formal dining room all,ep001
318,this wasted space that we can we can get,ep001
321,in the smaller package even if we were,ep001
324,to have a bunch of kids over that's,ep001
327,where the backyard is for we're looking,ep001
330,for at least a quarter of an acre for a,ep001
333,lot gives the kids enough room to run,ep001
336,around and we really don't want to have,ep001
339,a house that's stacked on top of another,ep001
342,house and then on the inside I like my,ep001
345,nice light and bright kitchens okay,ep001
348,I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and,ep001
351,so I really like white kitchens a nice,ep001
354,big sized kitchen island would be nice,ep001
357,for me but nice for Ethan would meet a,ep001
360,home that has a sauna it's a great place,ep001
363,to relax I've always enjoyed doing that,ep001
366,after a workout and there's one more,ep001
369,item that's a must for both of them some,ep001
372,nice views remind us of home okay so,ep001
375,that's gonna be a little challenging but,ep001
378,I'm always up for a challenge first up,ep001
381,is a place Nicole chose with Danielle in,ep001
384,mind I love it it's a two-story has a,ep001
387,very strong Craftsman look to it I,ep001
390,really like it does look nice I just,ep001
393,"wish it was a ranch-style it's 4,500",ep001
396,square feet we've got five bedrooms four,ep001
399,baths and it's completely finished from,ep001
402,top to bottom seems a little big maybe,ep001
405,more than what we need what's the price,ep001
408,five hundred and sixty nine thousand,ep001
411,nine hundred okay so still within budget,ep001
414,well higher than I wanted to go so let's,ep001
417,go take a look inside,ep001
420,like the entryway it's a huge high,ep001
423,ceilings,ep001
426,you guys find like a second level over,ep001
429,here is your formal living room I'm a,ep001
432,fan of formal living rooms even though,ep001
435,he really could care she was kind of,ep001
438,like a waste of space to me you're gonna,ep001
441,get this space when you're in this much,ep001
444,square footage right which is why we,ep001
447,"need 3,000 square feet I don't like that",ep001
450,it's carpet I would prefer to have,ep001
453,hardwood all throughout but that's not,ep001
456,you can definitely add I personally,ep001
459,really like a formal dining room another,ep001
462,waste of space to me but lots of times,ep001
465,whenever we have people over we even use,ep001
468,it with like our buffet table,ep001
471,and then this is your family room I like,ep001
474,how it's got high ceilings beautiful,ep001
477,views aren't the views from here that's,ep001
480,gorgeous in here right the kitchen here,ep001
483,is really pretty how it opens up it's no,ep001
486,white it just started a little too,ep001
489,orange to me in the backsplash is beige,ep001
492,and the countertops are dark I don't,ep001
495,know it's just not necessarily my style,ep001
498,and I like the size of this island I,ep001
501,don't know if we necessarily need a prep,ep001
504,sink here but anyway they head outside,ep001
507,to see the yard so here's your spiral,ep001
510,staircase how awesome is this careful,ep001
513,it's a little tight I wouldn't want to,ep001
516,come down this after having a couple,ep001
519,drinks that's for sure look at your gas,ep001
522,fire pit over here it's massive,ep001
525,now I know you don't golf however I,ep001
528,think having a putting green in your,ep001
531,backyard is awesome I don't know I don't,ep001
534,know if we'd ever use it I feel like if,ep001
537,we had room for a trampoline that would,ep001
540,give our kids hours of entertainment as,ep001
543,opposed to maybe 10 minutes of,ep001
546,entertainment hitting balls in a hole I,ep001
549,don't know back inside they see the,ep001
552,finished basement oh looks like a great,ep001
555,spot so this is technically the fifth,ep001
558,bedroom,ep001
561,you have a barn door anyhow oh wow look,ep001
564,at this I think this would make a great,ep001
567,play area where the opening was all our,ep001
570,toys could go in here right this is,ep001
573,amazing,ep001
576,do you love it I love it this is a great,ep001
579,space I think the house is really too,ep001
582,big for what we need but a basement,ep001
585,makes up for a lot it's more than I,ep001
588,could have asked for there's also a full,ep001
591,bath on this level there's a urinal well,ep001
594,what do you think I think it's pretty,ep001
597,awesome I don't know if I've ever seen a,ep001
600,urinal in a house was this ever on your,ep001
603,wish list it is now up to levels they,ep001
606,see three bedrooms and a full bath been,ep001
609,down the hall is the master suite I like,ep001
612,the French doors coming in it's nice and,ep001
615,high ceilings too honey right good-size,ep001
618,the tub has a nice view is this the kids,ep001
621,bathroom I was just noticing that this,ep001
624,is kind of my height here it's a little,ep001
627,little very short down there Nicole,ep001
630,sighs I really wanted to love this house,ep001
633,kind of bit of a craftsman look that I,ep001
636,wanted it was this two-story that's,ep001
639,plenty of space I think it's got a,ep001
642,little more house than we need and,ep001
645,there's a lot of things that we'd want,ep001
648,to change yeah talk about adding,ep001
651,hardwood floors gets expensive yeah top,ep001
654,of our budget already yeah but it's got,ep001
657,great views,ep001
660,I had the basement it has a WOW factor,ep001
663,yeah a sment cannot be beat but the,ep001
666,backyard need a big space for the kids,ep001
669,and I just don't think we have it in,ep001
672,this house yeah so their agent has lined,ep001
675,up a ranch for Ethan but found a call,ep001
678,this is a little bit from the 70s,ep001
681,Ethan Danielle and their two kids have,ep001
684,just moved to Spokane Washington and are,ep001
687,looking to buy a house within a budget,ep001
690,"of $600,000 so far they've seen a",ep001
693,two-story craftsman Danielle's ideal,ep001
696,style but it was at the top of their,ep001
699,budget and it wasn't the ranch piece of,ep001
702,Wands so today their agent has lined up,ep001
705,a home for Ethan,ep001
708,Wow Nicole this is a little bit from the,ep001
711,70s yes I knew you're gonna say that,ep001
714,don't judge it by the curb appeal this,ep001
717,house actually has a ton to offer and,ep001
720,it's the ranch-style I was looking for,ep001
723,it's 5 bedroom 4 bath the square footage,ep001
726,"here is about 4,300 square feet big",ep001
729,house okay we're a small family we have,ep001
732,two kids we don't need four thousand,ep001
735,plus square feet the price on this is,ep001
738,lower than you guys were wanting it's,ep001
741,four hundred and sixty four thousand,ep001
744,five hundred okay interesting you have,ep001
747,"$100,000 to do whatever you want to this",ep001
750,house because it's way under budget,ep001
753,we're gonna have to keep that in mind,ep001
756,got the hardwood floors right it does,ep001
759,it's just an interesting space there's,ep001
762,really nothing in here except for it,ep001
765,just opens to the outside which could be,ep001
768,nice for entertaining right yes access a,ep001
771,lot of these older ranch homes are very,ep001
774,you know smaller rooms more closed off,ep001
777,might I've seen where they've taken,ep001
780,walls out and made them you know more of,ep001
783,that open feel okay so I'm gonna think,ep001
786,about as far as the stone on the,ep001
789,fireplace goes I actually kind of liked,ep001
792,that one you do like the white we do the,ep001
795,kitchens a little smaller than I know,ep001
798,you would like it does have your white,ep001
801,cabinets Danielle that was on your wish,ep001
804,list yeah,ep001
807,oh gosh this kitchens really small oh it,ep001
810,is with all this open space probably,ep001
813,expand the kitchen right it would be an,ep001
816,option you just keep a fireplace right,ep001
819,in the middle of your kitchen why not,ep001
822,I'm down for a renovation I think it's,ep001
825,fun to look at a place and see what you,ep001
828,can do with it if we revamp it and I can,ep001
831,bring in all new cabinets and all new,ep001
834,everything it could possibly be my,ep001
837,kitchen so that to me kind of pulls me,ep001
840,in a little bit they see a formal dining,ep001
843,room a full bath right off the kitchen,ep001
846,kind of an awkward space but then head,ep001
849,downstairs to the basement good,ep001
852,entertainment play area downstairs this,ep001
855,great great spot for another another TV,ep001
858,another place to watch some football I,ep001
861,do like the wood beams I think those are,ep001
864,pretty cool this is actually a really,ep001
867,large basement you can tell it just,ep001
870,can't keeps going and then in here is,ep001
873,more bedrooms keeps going also on this,ep001
876,level is a full bath there is a sauna,ep001
879,honey that is great ranch floorplan and,ep001
882,a sauna already there awesome my husband,ep001
885,could buy this house is specifically for,ep001
888,the sauna Ethan's always wanted a sauna,ep001
891,in a house so I know he's really gonna,ep001
894,push to be able to have that in his,ep001
897,basement I I know it back upstairs they,ep001
900,see a sunroom lots of beautiful windows,ep001
903,natural I really understand the point of,ep001
906,a sunroom be a great play area for the,ep001
909,kids I agree,ep001
912,and it's pretty back here it is just no,ep001
915,view well I got lots of flat space,ep001
918,plenty of room to run around,ep001
921,yeah back inside they see a bedroom and,ep001
924,the master oh honey it's gold good-sized,ep001
927,now don't kill me when you see the,ep001
930,bathroom look at this bathtub I think I,ep001
933,could fit it just fine let's see let's,ep001
936,see,ep001
939,it's actually like a two-person it's,ep001
942,kind of a gun a bit of a heart-shaped -,ep001
945,but this thing is huge this house is so,ep001
948,Corky it's so Corky and it's cool stuff,ep001
951,but all over that would have to go the,ep001
954,heart-shaped tub would go all that stuff,ep001
957,would go it's a lot of work,ep001
960,well blow our budget gives us gives us,ep001
963,room to spend great basement area mm-hmm,ep001
966,ranch style that I'm looking for there's,ep001
969,a lot of possibilities there are some,ep001
972,charming aspects to this house that I do,ep001
975,like and even though the house doesn't,ep001
978,have a view the backyard is really nice,ep001
981,I'd still like to see some more houses a,ep001
984,2-story so now their agents lined up a,ep001
987,two-story home with a view she hopes,ep001
990,they like but style may be an issue kind,ep001
993,of looks like a barn but we'll see what,ep001
996,we can do,ep001
999,[Music],ep001
1002,do you want to go straight fishing,ep001
1005,you've always talked about one hand go,ep001
1008,fishing,ep001
1011,Danielle and Ethan are moving their,ep001
1014,family from Colorado to Spokane,ep001
1017,Washington working with a budget of up,ep001
1020,"to $600,000 they've seen a two-story",ep001
1023,craftsman Danielle's style but it was,ep001
1026,pricey and Ethan thought it was more,ep001
1029,house than their family needs they've,ep001
1032,also seen a slightly smaller more,ep001
1035,affordable ranch,ep001
1038,Ethan style but it didn't have the views,ep001
1041,they want today they're seeing another,ep001
1044,option it's a little on the large side,ep001
1047,it's seventy one hundred square feet Oh,ep001
1050,however the price on this house is only,ep001
1053,three hundred and fifty five thousand so,ep001
1056,it leaves you a ton for any renovations,ep001
1059,you wanna do and you give each access,ep001
1062,really yeah it's great think of that,ep001
1065,yeah we never even thought about having,ep001
1068,a home that close to the lake it's a bit,ep001
1071,of a giant rectangle though and you can,ep001
1074,tell the other homes around the area are,ep001
1077,all updated but this one certainly isn't,ep001
1080,well for the price you will expect to,ep001
1083,have more of a fixer-upper renovation,ep001
1086,but the bones are great okay kind of,ep001
1089,looks like a barn but uh we'll see what,ep001
1092,we can do,ep001
1095,[Music],ep001
1098,keep an open mind it's kind of nice,ep001
1101,sighs boy hey I am but I'd want to I,ep001
1104,guess I have to see the rest of the,ep001
1107,house,ep001
1110,well I'm gonna take you up to the best,ep001
1113,part of the house first so you guys know,ep001
1116,why I brought you here okay all right,ep001
1119,let's check it out,ep001
1122,I like the wood beams up here yeah the,ep001
1125,tall ceiling yes Wow but look at this,ep001
1128,that is amazing,ep001
1131,isn't this gorgeous okay yeah you can't,ep001
1134,beat this I can see why you brought us,ep001
1137,you're right this is take this all in,ep001
1140,right see the kids playing down on the,ep001
1143,beach swimming around they'd love it,ep001
1146,they would love it living in this house,ep001
1149,would would be like being on vacation,ep001
1152,it's something that's very unique we,ep001
1155,make this what into like an upstairs,ep001
1158,family room instead of having like a,ep001
1161,basement entertainment center area yeah,ep001
1164,we could make this that this house has a,ep001
1167,wackadoodle layout but if we can open,ep001
1170,our minds to actually turning that into,ep001
1173,an upstairs entertaining area it could,ep001
1176,be great for entertaining also on this,ep001
1179,level is the master suite,ep001
1182,it's a very paint it's the size of my,ep001
1185,first apartment this is way more space,ep001
1188,than we need the size of this house is,ep001
1191,too much for anybody danielle has a,ep001
1194,habit to fill whatever space she has so,ep001
1197,if we get a bigger house we will end up,ep001
1200,with more stuff so that's kind of my,ep001
1203,fear it's with a large master you,ep001
1206,definitely need a large master bathroom,ep001
1209,it's a good size we just have to,ep001
1212,completely rework it they see a bedroom,ep001
1215,off the master and then head back,ep001
1218,downstairs to see the main living area,ep001
1221,all right here's a kitchen orange,ep001
1224,cabinets cabinets I have a feeling,ep001
1227,you're gonna say that yeah dated,ep001
1230,[Music],ep001
1233,oh it would be something again that we'd,ep001
1236,fix Daniel and I love to do work on our,ep001
1239,houses we could definitely do work on,ep001
1242,this one it might be too much though,ep001
1245,they see another bedroom and a full bath,ep001
1248,on this level so this is your main floor,ep001
1251,family room I want to show you the two,ep001
1254,remaining bedrooms okay okay okay okay,ep001
1257,pretty much Fathoms it up so saving the,ep001
1260,great view from the main deck for last,ep001
1263,takes you kind of back to what you liked,ep001
1266,about the house to begin with a lot of,ep001
1269,house but where else are we gonna get,ep001
1272,something something like that waking up,ep001
1275,to that every day is it strata but,ep001
1278,that's a lot of renovation inside and we,ep001
1281,don't know what we'd be getting into,ep001
1284,they've seen several houses that could,ep001
1287,be a good fit for their family but their,ep001
1290,choice may come down to style view and,ep001
1293,price honey I think we need to talk,ep001
1296,about this and try to make a decision,ep001
1299,pretty quickly,ep001
1302,[Music],ep001
1305,what do you think about going to a new,ep001
1308,school in Spokane and making new friends,ep001
1311,no Ethan and Danielle are relocating to,ep001
1314,Spokane Washington and they need to buy,ep001
1317,a house for their family within their,ep001
1320,"$600,000 budget what did you think about",ep001
1323,that craftsman 2-story with the putting,ep001
1326,green,ep001
1329,it wasn't really my style but it had an,ep001
1332,open floor plan like we like I had great,ep001
1335,views so that that was a nice thing,ep001
1338,about the basement was amazing I didn't,ep001
1341,like the kitchen though,ep001
1344,because the kitchen has the orange,ep001
1347,cabinets but it's already at the top of,ep001
1350,the top end of the budget so we won't,ep001
1353,really have that much room to you know,ep001
1356,to play with that's it,ep001
1359,so we had my ranch style I like the,ep001
1362,backyard because it was nice and flat,ep001
1365,however there were no view and a great,ep001
1368,basement you think it had a great,ep001
1371,basement cuz there's a sauna however do,ep001
1374,you know what else is in the basement,ep001
1377,the kids bedrooms right we'd have to,ep001
1380,rework that floor plan to actually,ep001
1383,mingle so there's a lot of work to be,ep001
1386,done but it's below budget gives us some,ep001
1389,money to play with what about the lake,ep001
1392,house it's well below budget three,ep001
1395,hundred and fifty five thousand dollars,ep001
1398,I don't know if we could stay in budget,ep001
1401,and renovate that entire house it's,ep001
1404,probably more house than we need the,ep001
1407,views cannot be beat it is amazing,ep001
1410,and we would be crazy not to go with the,ep001
1413,lake house it's a rare opportunity to,ep001
1416,get something with that kind of view and,ep001
1419,that kind of beauty you don't find that,ep001
1422,every day it's such a tough call but I I,ep001
1425,think I know which one I want,ep001
1428,[Music],ep001
1431,I really think for our family they pick,ep001
1434,the craftsmen's gonna work the best I,ep001
1437,think it had a good floor plan the rest,ep001
1440,of the house I think is something with,ep001
1443,it we could work with there are some,ep001
1446,things that don't make sense for us with,ep001
1449,that basement you don't get any better,ep001
1452,than right I really think our family,ep001
1455,could be very happy there well let's,ep001
1458,give it a call a call let's color at,ep001
1461,"$569,000 I get five hundred and seventy",ep001
1464,three thousand nine hundred we closed on,ep001
1467,the house about three weeks ago and,ep001
1470,basically we handed over the keys to,ep001
1473,general contractor and they think it and,ep001
1476,work on the remodel that we're doing,ep001
1479,ever since so we're hoping to be moving,ep001
1482,in in about one week we've made quite a,ep001
1485,few changes we extended hardwood floors,ep001
1488,throughout the entire main level created,ep001
1491,a new office up front where we had the,ep001
1494,formal living room built our wall there,ep001
1497,and now we have a formal dining room but,ep001
1500,instead also an office on the main level,ep001
1503,at the subway tile it's gonna be that,ep001
1506,extra long waiting subway tile like that,ep001
1509,that's gonna be nice yeah I'm gonna do,ep001
1512,offset yeah yeah with like a black route,ep001
1515,could look pretty cool with all the,ep001
1518,other black hardware that we're doing in,ep001
1521,here I think that looked pretty sure we,ep001
1524,didn't quite get Danielle her whole,ep001
1527,white kitchen but we did do some new,ep001
1530,countertops and a new sink and really,ep001
1533,lighten and brighten that area up I,ep001
1536,think,ep001
1539,and then the fireplace you totally redid,ep001
1542,the fireplace and now it's a really cool,ep001
1545,accent piece in the house I love it what,ep001
1548,gets me about this house every time I,ep001
1551,walk in the door is the views the views,ep001
1554,are spectacular and the basement,ep001
1557,maybe he's pretty cool I think we can't,ep001
1560,wait to have our first get-together,ep001
1563,where's your putter Enola and the kids,ep001
1566,so far you don't mean we just stopped by,ep001
1569,the house and to see how the,ep001
1572,construction is going and such the kids,ep001
1575,automatically just run to the backyard,ep001
1578,and start golfing and they love the,ep001
1581,putting green they love it that's how,ep001
1584,you do it she's cheating finding the,ep001
1587,right house for us it was really,ep001
1590,important I think this is a great home,ep001
1593,for our family where we can grow it's a,ep001
1596,good place for our family to start our,ep001
1599,lives here in Spokane,ep001
12,look at that chandelier that's exactly,ep002
15,what I wanted my walk-in closet,ep002
18,part-time pageant queen Lulu is looking,ep002
21,for a bigger home in Coconut Creek,ep002
24,Florida and a huge walk-in closet is,ep002
27,number one on her list the queen has,ep002
30,entered husband Charlie just wants a,ep002
33,home on a golf course I don't want any,ep002
36,balls flying through the windows what is,ep002
39,that looks like a golf ball has been,ep002
42,through here and they have different,ep002
45,priorities when it comes to the kitchen,ep002
48,I know you knew Sophia but I'm the cook,ep002

72,cheese so good nice good he met at a,ep002
75,fast food restaurant out of all places I,ep002
78,looked up and there was a tall handsome,ep002
81,man across the way under 80 pounds of,ep002
84,twisted steel and sex appeal babe I,ep002

105,do you think lemon I started patting,ep002
108,treat in college but what I love about,ep002

114,pageantry is a passion it's lots of,ep002
117,court her both Florida natives they,ep002
120,settled in the city of Coconut Creek,ep002

141,they want to upgrade from their starter,ep002
144,home to something with more space and,ep002
147,Lulu would prefer a low-maintenance,ep002
150,new-build townhome a Mediterranean style,ep002
153,home I love that look I think it's just,ep002
156,beautiful in social order I would like a,ep002
159,a single-family ranch home on a golf,ep002
162,course I think a wrench home fits better,ep002
165,on a golf course then the type of home,ep002
168,that you like when I hear ranch-style I,ep002
171,think lots of work lots of maintenance,ep002
174,just a lot of upkeep you know I'm pretty,ep002
177,high maintenance so I don't want to do,ep002
180,as much work she's not crazy about,ep002
183,living on a golf course either when,ep002
186,you'd like a house like that no I don't,ep002
189,want any balls flying through the,ep002
192,windows I really want a two-story I want,ep002
195,all the bedrooms to be upstairs but,ep002
198,going up and down stairs all the time,ep002
201,it's good actors,ep002
204,I prefer just to have it on one level I,ep002
207,love the feel of carpet you know between,ep002
210,my toes,ep002
213,maybe tile downstairs and carpet you,ep002
216,know upstairs you do have a pet so I,ep002
219,prefer to have the wood floors ah my,ep002
222,crowns can't forget about my cards,ep002
225,I am a pageant queen and I own a lot of,ep002
228,gowns a lot of crowns and a lot of,ep002
231,sashes I really want a huge walk-in,ep002

264,that's it I'm the cook for me all I need,ep002
267,is this uh you know up today stove I,ep002
270,want an iridescent backsplash I think,ep002
273,that's so beautiful I love how the light,ep002
276,hits it stainless steel appliances even,ep002
279,though I can't cook I look good in it,ep002
282,he'd also like an open floor plan and a,ep002
285,big yard to entertain friends and family,ep002
288,so you guys have a big list I'll be,ep002
291,really on and it's not the same list,ep002
294,Sophia is my pageant sister we actually,ep002
297,competed in pageants and she has been a,ep002
300,friend ever since I'd like to stay in a,ep002
303,low 300s right babe I think we can go up,ep002
306,to 350 definitely I'm more willing to,ep002
309,compromise in this relationship but also,ep002
312,want to keep her grounded,ep002
315,he has common sense you know I don't,ep002

339,know put my car in there Charlie just,ep002
342,give it a chance,ep002
345,see what we got come on and,ep002
348,like it's a little narrow although it is,ep002
351,narrow you do have the natural light,ep002
354,coming in so it gives it a lot bigger,ep002
357,and more holes and feel nice formal,ep002
360,dining area we have a lot of friends and,ep002
363,family over Sofia so definitely wanted a,ep002
366,big dining room little bit in one story,ep002
369,like I asked for a lot more room right,ep002
372,solo is gonna be right here a dining,ep002
375,room table right here I think it's,ep002
378,enough space I don't know about your 40,ep002
381,people you know maybe one at a time yes,ep002
384,[Applause],ep002
387,but I know that you did say the dining,ep002
390,room was a little bit smaller than you,ep002
393,want it but this one can compensate this,ep002
396,can be a dining room I'm not thinking,ep002
399,dining room though,ep002
402,maybe a family room area where the huge,ep002
405,television screen now while you're doing,ep002
408,there watching Sunday football I know my,ep002
411,girl Lulu gonna come in here and just,ep002

441,something to love it bigger though you,ep002

456,get annoyed by that they head back in to,ep002

465,have bedroom one oh and then you have,ep002

522,sink Charlie you have your side over,ep002
525,there I have my side no more sharing I,ep002
528,like it it's a big you know standing,ep002
531,shower but the top would have been great,ep002
534,yeah a jetted tub wouldn't be a really,ep002
537,nice big wooden perfect perfect it was,ep002
540,beautiful I really like the exterior it,ep002
543,had the double vanity and the walk-in,ep002
546,closet,ep002
549,that was phenomenal I didn't want to go,ep002
552,upstairs actually accommodate was 18,ep002
555,steps it wasn't on a golf course right,ep002
558,and then the backyard wasn't big enough,ep002
561,for me and my family so now it's,ep002
564,Charlie's turn is it on a golf course it,ep002
567,is on a golf course so that's the roof,ep002
570,that is my roof,ep002
573,[Music],ep002
576,look at that chandelier yeah that's,ep002
579,exactly what I wanted my walk-in closet,ep002
582,Charlie and Lulu want to upgrade to a,ep002
585,bigger home in Coconut Creek Florida he,ep002
588,wants a one-story single-family ranch on,ep002
591,a golf course she wants a two-story,ep002
594,Mediterranean townhome with a huge,ep002
597,walk-in closet for all of her pageant,ep002
600,gowns he's hoping to find something,ep002
603,priced in the low 300s but she's ready,ep002
606,to spend up to three hundred and fifty,ep002
609,thousand dollars for the right house,ep002
612,they've seen a two-story Mediterranean,ep002
615,townhome with a huge walk-in closet,ep002
618,but no golf course or big yard for,ep002
621,Charlie today they're seeing a home in a,ep002
624,Gulf community it's a beautiful,ep002
627,ranch-style house 3 bedroom 3 full,ep002
630,bathroom home listed for 349 tell me a,ep002
633,little bit more is it on a golf course,ep002
636,it is on a golf course of course he,ep002
639,likes that there is an HOA 125 but that,ep002
642,also compensates for the golf course,ep002
645,okay,ep002
648,and so that's the roof that is my roof,ep002
651,but I'm liking this roof over here that,ep002
654,one has been more updated and recently,ep002
657,by the owners but you guys can also,ep002
660,change the roof style as well okay so as,ep002
663,you walk in you have this really nice,ep002
666,Clint yard oh I like this maybe an area,ep002

717,directly into the formal dining area and,ep002
720,loulou I can see your chandelier oh yeah,ep002

804,no carpet and then I got a view of the,ep002
807,golf course again so not only do you,ep002

861,know I'd like to take my bath okay I,ep002
864,[Music],ep002
867,like that is a ranch-style home single,ep002
870,level home that is on a golf course it's,ep002
873,a great space for entertaining guests we,ep002
876,had separate walk-in closets but it's,ep002
879,not the Mediterranean style that I was,ep002
882,looking for you know it needs some,ep002
885,updating yeah and I know you guys,ep002
888,weren't comfortable at the price of,ep002
891,three hundred and forty nine thousand I,ep002
894,definitely think that I can work on that,ep002
897,and getting it a lot lower okay in the,ep002
900,meantime Sophia's lined up another home,ep002
903,on a golf course what's that face one,ep002
906,this is not the exterior that I'm,ep002
909,looking for but I'm gonna give it a,ep002
912,chance,ep002
915,gonna give it a chance I'm gonna have a,ep002
918,fist and what would you live in a box of,ep002
921,soda please you got it Lulu and Charlie,ep002
924,are ready to start a family and are,ep002

930,Coconut Creek Florida she's willing to,ep002
933,spend up to three hundred and fifty,ep002
936,thousand dollars but he'd prefer to stay,ep002
939,in the low 300s so far they've seen a,ep002
942,two-story new construction townhome with,ep002
945,a huge master closet her preference and,ep002
948,a single-story ranch on a golf course,ep002
951,his preference today they're seeing,ep002
954,another home in a golf community so we,ep002
957,are on a golf course again a sort of a,ep002
960,ranch-style home it's three bedrooms two,ep002
963,full baths two-car garage is wrong and,ep002
966,it's under your budget at three hundred,ep002
969,and five thousand what's that face what,ep002
972,it's not the exterior that I'm looking,ep002
975,for but I'm gonna give it a chance I'm,ep002
978,gonna give it a chance just letting you,ep002
981,know right now I'm liking that it's a,ep002
984,ranch you know Charlie I'm glad you like,ep002
987,it,ep002
990,so what do you think yeah you like it I,ep002
993,think it's pretty small it seems as,ep002
996,though it was a little bit smaller it's,ep002
999,actually not this is just a little bit,ep002
1002,"over 1,600 square feet okay I do like",ep002
1005,the open concept though it's really open,ep002
1008,and you can see all through the house I,ep002
1011,like that I do like that we are high,ep002
1014,ceiling and I like the winds have,ep002
1017,shutters and I do like that it's tile,ep002
1020,and no concrete and you actually get a,ep002
1023,great view of your golf course charlie,ep002
1026,yeah see that yes nice right that hole,ep002
1029,now this is what I'm talking about an,ep002
1032,open view kitchen where I don't have any,ep002
1035,walls covering up I like the countertops,ep002
1038,and the stainless-steel appliances and,ep002
1041,what I love about it is this iridescent,ep002
1044,backsplash I was looking for this and,ep002
1047,Charlie I can see you cooking in here,ep002
1050,watch your football game like it works,ep002

1065,built-in grill area bar area so it's,ep002
1068,great for entertaining - yeah Chico,ep002
1071,actually adds a little place to roam,ep002
1074,here back inside they see two bedrooms,ep002
1077,and a bath then the master oh wow I love,ep002
1080,the double French doors here that's,ep002
1083,great love this size of the room you can,ep002
1086,look out towards the golf course what is,ep002
1089,that looks like a golf ball has been,ep002
1092,through here I'm not buying it,ep002
1095,now in here you have your master walk-in,ep002
1098,closet oh no Sophia this is not it this,ep002
1101,is not enough for a small closet you can,ep002
1104,actually knock out that closet and,ep002
1107,extend it oh really we do have room in,ep002
1110,the budget takes it in my closet well I,ep002
1113,do like the door,ep002
1116,sinks here this is subpar so far yes,ep002
1119,well it doesn't have the tub that I'm,ep002
1122,looking for,ep002
1125,yeah very dated we would have to do some,ep002
1128,updates,ep002
1131,yeah I'm grading here yeah,ep002
1134,[Music],ep002
1137,I like that is a ranch home that is on a,ep002
1140,golf course and that the kitchen was,ep002
1143,really nice I really did I like some of,ep002
1146,the updating and made it feel like new,ep002
1149,construction there is a little updating,ep002
1152,to do in the home the master bathroom,ep002
1155,was just atrocious the closet and no,ep002
1158,bueno for me and no matter what both of,ep002
1161,you say I know that was a golf ball that,ep002
1164,was through that window allegedly,ep002
1167,allegedly okay after seeing several,ep002
1170,options it won't be an easy decision for,ep002
1173,Charlie and Lulu their choice may come,ep002
1176,down to style floor plan and golf,ep002
1179,courses you guys ready to make our offer,ep002
1182,a house or what did you think about them,ep002
1185,[Music],ep002
1188,Lulu and Charlie have seen how much,ep002
1191,"house 350,000 dollars will get them in",ep002
1194,the Coconut Creek area now it's time to,ep002
1197,decide so what did you think of the new,ep002
1200,construction that one was listed at,ep002
1203,three hundred and thirty-four thousand,ep002
1206,dollars it was a Mediterranean feel that,ep002
1209,I was you know looking for I immediately,ep002
1212,fell in love with the layout of the home,ep002
1215,a walk-in closet was phenomenal it,ep002
1218,didn't have much room for Chico in the,ep002
1221,backyard but besides that it was it was,ep002
1224,great I don't want a two-story home and,ep002
1227,"if I'm gonna pay 300 over $300,000 per",ep002
1230,home I rather be on the conference the,ep002
1233,Golf Course is really only a mile down,ep002
1236,the street well how about the,ep002
1239,contemporary but still a ranch-style,ep002
1242,that was listed for 349 thousand it was,ep002
1245,just the eyesore for me when I first,ep002
1248,walked up but as soon as he walked in,ep002
1251,the house though it was so spacious but,ep002
1254,what I really loved about the home was,ep002
1257,the master suite the separate closets,ep002
1260,the separate bathrooms I mean come on I,ep002
1263,like that it was a single-story home,ep002
1266,it had a porch in the backyard there led,ep002
1269,right out to the golf course just a,ep002
1272,little bit overpriced though and there's,ep002
1275,gonna be a lot of updating in at home I,ep002
1278,can definitely work on that to get it to,ep002
1281,where you guys want it to be so what'd,ep002
1284,you guys think about the updated ranch,ep002
1287,for three hundred and five thousand I,ep002
1290,didn't like the exterior and as soon as,ep002
1293,I walked in the door I thought at first,ep002
1296,sight wow it's pretty but it's small but,ep002
1299,as we walked through the house I started,ep002
1302,to like it more I love the kitchen they,ep002
1305,had the open concept that I could look,ep002
1308,throughout the whole house and then,ep002
1311,there was a bonus in that house which,ep002
1314,was the pool so the house was a really,ep002
1317,great house for entertaining guests,ep002
1320,the walk-in closet which wasn't a,ep002
1323,walking class that wasn't a walk-in,ep002
1326,closet and the bathroom needs lots of,ep002
1329,updates as well,ep002
1332,living on the Golf Course flying balls,ep002
1335,coming from the course and I don't care,ep002
1338,both of you say I know it was a golf,ep002
1341,ball I'm inclined to go with the new,ep002
1344,construction you know the first home,ep002
1347,owners to live in that house on top of,ep002
1350,that the other house that was a golf,ep002
1353,ball okay so I can always trap them how,ep002
1356,down the street to a golf course so are,ep002

1377,listing price of the house was 334 and,ep002
1380,we got it for 334 we purchased laminate,ep002

1386,took up the carpet which is something I,ep002
1389,didn't want oh my god my closet is a,ep002
1392,dream closet closet,ep002

1407,to put more pavement there so we can,ep002

1413,put a fence as well cuz we want that for,ep002
1416,Chico I had to compromise the most I,ep002
1419,didn't get the golf course I didn't get,ep002
1422,the big backyard I didn't get the ranch,ep002
1425,home the one-story but you got me there,ep002

39,cute it's a glam enough for you,ep003
42,this is glam this is me this really,ep003
45,speaks to her aesthetic,ep003

75,and this is my sister Tanika and we're,ep003
78,in Atlanta Georgia I'm a locations,ep003
81,coordinator in the TV and film industry,ep003
84,I'm an account manager and I work for a,ep003
87,real estate technology company it's just,ep003
90,been busy busy busy lots of clients in,ep003
93,town jennifer and I are half sisters we,ep003
96,both were born in Germany our parents,ep003
99,were in the army my mom moved back to,ep003
102,the States,ep003
105,right and my mom decided to stay in,ep003
108,Germany so I lived there for most of my,ep003
111,childhood before moving to Florida and I,ep003
114,grew up in New York City we reunited,ep003
117,because I found her on social media yeah,ep003
120,it was really cool I jog this trail a,ep003
123,lot so maybe I have to join you one day,ep003
126,and doggin two years ago Jen relocated,ep003
129,to Atlanta for work a year later,ep003
132,Tanika and her cats and man joined her,ep003
135,now they all live in Jenn's one-bedroom,ep003
138,rental they make and really take over,ep003
141,the space he thinks he runs this place,ep003
144,Sandman you need your own space so you,ep003
147,can stretch out we're currently living,ep003
150,in the Old Fourth Ward neighborhood,ep003
153,that's really close to downtown Atlanta,ep003
156,Oh forth word is also a historical,ep003
159,neighborhood Martin Luther King jr. was,ep003
162,born nearby there are a lot of young,ep003
165,urban professionals here and that's,ep003
168,what's really great about this,ep003
171,neighborhood but while they love this,ep003
174,area,ep003
177,they've outgrown their condo I am,ep003
180,currently sleeping in her living room on,ep003
183,a folding bed and we definitely need,ep003
186,more space the lease is coming up so I,ep003
189,figured why not take the leap into a,ep003
192,home ownership I'm going to be the one,ep003
195,that's purchasing the home but since I,ep003
198,still want to live with my sister she,ep003
201,definitely still has input as to what it,ep003
204,is that I'm going to buy for us,ep003
207,"all right so I'm thinking 250,000 might",ep003
210,be my max let's see what that actually,ep003
213,looks like monthly interested in buying,ep003
216,a home in Atlanta yeah okay so go all,ep003
219,right show me what you got it,ep003
222,seems doable especially with you helping,ep003
225,out right that would put a major relief,ep003
228,on you for sure now the only problem is,ep003
231,that they have completely different,ep003
234,tastes,ep003
237,Wow I'm really liking this I love the,ep003
240,Craftsman style I really do like having,ep003
243,brick and wood and all of that kind of,ep003
246,blended in I really like the French,ep003
249,Provincial type of home with the brick,ep003
252,exterior as far as the interior,ep003
255,decorating,ep003
258,I love the glam style grand entrance,ep003
261,high ceilings nice chandelier look at,ep003
264,that condo well you know how I feel,ep003
267,about that gens open to buying a condo,ep003
270,with the space they need if that's what,ep003
273,it takes to stay in the Old Fourth Ward,ep003
276,but Tanika isn't convinced I'm gonna,ep003
279,push to get us into a single-family home,ep003
282,they're so expensive,ep003
285,I would love to have a more open type of,ep003
288,floor plan I'm not really into the open,ep003
291,floor plan concept because you walk in,ep003
294,everything is right there feels less,ep003
297,homey to me I would just add a little,ep003
300,sparkle to it to give it a more of that,ep003
303,clam bake or in the kitchen they both,ep003
306,want granite countertops and stainless,ep003
309,steel appliances but I like white bright,ep003
312,kitchens yeah I don't really like white,ep003
315,it's too stark to me if it could just be,ep003
318,the natural wood finish I love carpet,ep003
321,Jen likes hardwood floors I do it's easy,ep003
324,to clean but I'm the one always sleeping,ep003
327,I sweep too I never see you sweetie I've,ep003
330,swept several times,ep003
333,okay in our apartment now there is a,ep003
336,fireplace and I would still like to have,ep003
339,a fireplace in our next space but we,ep003
342,never use the fireplace in this space it,ep003
345,looks really cute one thing they do,ep003
348,agree on is they prefer to stay near,ep003
351,downtown Atlanta if I can find something,ep003
354,here we would definitely try to stay put,ep003
357,first up is a condo in the 4th ward,ep003
360,their ideal area I like it it has that,ep003
363,whole Craftsman style that I'm looking,ep003
366,for it has the brick it has the wood on,ep003
369,the exterior for me on the outside it's,ep003
372,perfect,ep003
375,the only thing I like about it is,ep003
378,there's Sun break with this that's about,ep003
381,it it's not a single-family home like,ep003
384,what I want it I just want to walk,ep003
387,straight into a home not another,ep003
390,building with neighbors,ep003
393,Tania's gonna have to accept the fact,ep003
396,that trying to find a single-family home,ep003
399,in that price range and the city limits,ep003
402,is gonna be very challenging so this,ep003
405,even is actually a two-bedroom,ep003
408,"two-bathroom unit $29,000 all right well",ep003
411,that's in my budget that's good yeah how,ep003
414,"big is it it's just under 1,500 square",ep003
417,feet all right well we get more space,ep003
420,that's true it's actually gonna be on,ep003
423,the third floor the third floor there's,ep003
426,no elevator is there anything no this,ep003
429,unit actually does not have an elevator,ep003
432,for it oh wow okay ladies first,ep003
435,all right ooh I love these hardwoods,ep003
438,we're gonna go straight ahead to the,ep003
441,living room wow you have a loft in this,ep003
444,one and that many units over here have,ep003
447,that I like the fact that there are high,ep003
450,ceilings you know because it gives that,ep003
453,feeling of walking into a home although,ep003
456,this is a condo oh and I love this,ep003
459,fireplace brings a lot of charm I think,ep003
462,it limits how much furniture you can,ep003
465,actually put in here though the granite,ep003
468,is all right I hate the color this is a,ep003
471,very dark kitchen it is a dirty kitchen,ep003
474,I would love for this to just be all,ep003
477,wood I do love the carpet no I wish the,ep003
480,carpet wasn't here but you would have,ep003
483,next to sleep in here I would and you,ep003
486,would have your own bathroom okay it's,ep003
489,definitely,ep003
492,glam it up a little bit add some bling,ep003
495,so I guess this is the closet oh wow wow,ep003
498,this is huge look look at all that is,ep003
501,orange I can do this back down the hall,ep003
504,is the master bed,ep003
507,more carpet which I don't really care,ep003
510,for but I do like the fact that it is a,ep003
513,true master it's seamless movement,ep003
516,master bath affair madam has been,ep003
519,someone renovated okay I love this,ep003
522,garden tub this is really good isn't it,ep003
525,and you have a huge walk-in closet yeah,ep003
528,look at all this space you actually have,ep003
531,access to the outside patio from your,ep003
534,master bedroom oh wow,ep003
537,one thing I do love is this city view,ep003
540,look at that you can see the skyline,ep003
543,which means we are in a great location,ep003
546,however we do have a view right onto the,ep003
549,street so that would be a problem with,ep003
552,traffic noise back inside they head,ep003
555,upstairs to see the loft I'm just loving,ep003
558,the carpets I wish that the hardwoods,ep003
561,were extended up into this space I like,ep003
564,the bonus space it can be like an office,ep003
567,space plus an extra guest space yeah,ep003
570,things that I like are definitely the,ep003
573,hardwood floors I wish they were,ep003
576,throughout everything you know this is,ep003
579,in the area that I like I get to stay in,ep003
582,Old Fourth Ward downtown city views the,ep003
585,location is perfect so a good job on,ep003
588,that one,ep003
591,however it's still in the condo and I do,ep003
594,not like the kitchen you can expand the,ep003
597,search you know some single-family homes,ep003
600,I was gonna make that work since Tamika,ep003
603,said on a single-family home they're,ep003
606,seeing one but we're definitely in the,ep003
609,suburbs far from the city this hair,ep003
612,situation yeah it's a lot a lot atlanta,ep003
615,professional jen is hunting for her,ep003
618,first home with a 250 thousand dollar,ep003
621,budget and help from her sister Tanika,ep003
624,so far she's seen a condo in the Old,ep003
627,Fourth Ward close to downtown her ideal,ep003
630,location but Tanika is pushing for a,ep003
633,single-family home so now they're seeing,ep003
636,one in the city of Marietta about 30,ep003
639,minutes from downtown Atlanta we're,ep003
642,definitely in the suburbs far from the,ep003
645,city this a bit far it's gonna be a,ep003
648,little dry but I'm glad we're at least,ep003
651,able to see a house today,ep003
654,it's cute it has that Craftsman style,ep003
657,cute red door and,ep003
660,color you know it's a neutral color it's,ep003
663,not too bad look at this brick I love,ep003

681,"I'm excited this is actually $225,000",ep003
684,you'll see it's right within your budget,ep003
687,five hundred square feet four bedrooms,ep003
690,two and a half bathrooms,ep003
693,Wow that's a lot of space this is,ep003
696,actually the sunken living room don't,ep003
699,like the carpet I wish they would have,ep003
702,extended the wood out to here but it's,ep003
705,kind of strange though because you have,ep003
708,dark wood here you have gray carpet and,ep003
711,then light wood in the dining room yeah,ep003
714,that is really different I wish they,ep003
717,would have kept it consistent I like,ep003
720,that it's not open it has a separation I,ep003
723,would prefer that it was all one open,ep003
726,space I do like how that's kind of open,ep003
729,right there there's a little bit of,ep003
732,openness yeah this is fun I can see,ep003
735,Sandman running around and looking at it,ep003
738,I love this kitchen,ep003
741,this is so much room and look at the,ep003
744,white cabinets in the light countertops,ep003
747,I love it this is a really cute kitchen,ep003
750,it looks like there's a lot of updated,ep003
753,appliances um there's some character,ep003
756,here I mean it looks nice it's a white,ep003
759,kitchen don't really care for that but,ep003
762,it's a very beautiful kitchen Oh so this,ep003
765,could be Sandman's corner well has a,ep003
768,fenced-in backyard if it wasn't raining,ep003
771,I'd take you guys back there huge like,ep003
774,it only thing is with backyards who is,ep003
777,going to mow this bad boy are a sexy,ep003
780,more guy if we get this house and hire a,ep003
783,long guy he's going to look like the guy,ep003
786,who plays Thor,ep003
789,I like this archway opening into this,ep003
792,room yeah a lot of character Wow Wow,ep003
795,look how grand these ceilings are this,ep003
798,is so high I don't think I've seen any,ep003
801,ceilings this high in a home before and,ep003
804,I love it this isn't real,ep003
807,big space and for a livingroom area this,ep003
810,is really nice,ep003
813,as a fireplace which is really cute they,ep003
816,see a half bath downstairs then head,ep003
819,upstairs to see the master bedroom,ep003
822,oh wow this is big this is a huge master,ep003
825,bedroom it's definitely a lot of space,ep003
828,in here it looks like we have carpet,ep003
831,here which I'm not a fan of this is a,ep003
834,huge bathroom it's a huge bathroom where,ep003
837,is the shower right oh oh the standard,ep003
840,shower in the corner I like that there's,ep003
843,a tub in here and it has the Jets but do,ep003
846,you feel like these are kind of low,ep003
849,it really is low it looks like I'll have,ep003
852,to get all the way down ailing yeah oh,ep003
855,this is pretty big this is a really big,ep003
858,closet,ep003
861,they see two guest bedrooms and a hall,ep003
864,bath for tanika it's purple it is purple,ep003
867,but I think I kind of like it well as,ep003
870,long as you like the purple bathroom yes,ep003
873,all right we take out the ceiling fan,ep003
876,and put a chandelier if is gonna be,ep003
879,something hanging but I like the color,ep003
882,as though the cup nice to me down the,ep003
885,hall is the last bedroom this is a nice,ep003
888,room and you have two closets instead of,ep003
891,one the room that she'll be utilizing is,ep003
894,much smaller than the master so that,ep003
897,would have to be one of the biggest,ep003
900,compromises and I hope she'd be okay,ep003
903,with that,ep003
906,[Music],ep003
909,the drive is long I will say that for,ep003
912,the price to get this much space is a,ep003
915,bonus so now their real-estate agents,ep003
918,lined up another option a single-family,ep003
921,home closer to downtown price is 255,ep003
924,budget I don't know I just love the fact,ep003
927,that even though we're inside a city,ep003
930,there's always these nice little hidden,ep003
933,spaces and it's not so much of the,ep003
936,hustle and bustle Jan and her sister,ep003
939,Tameka are looking for a home in Atlanta,ep003
942,with in Jen's 250 thousand dollar budget,ep003
945,so far they've seen a condo in their,ep003
948,ideal location near downtown but Jan is,ep003
951,starting to agree with Tanika that a,ep003
954,house of their own might be the way to,ep003
957,go they've also seen an affordable,ep003
960,single-family home with a lot of square,ep003
963,footage but it was 30 minutes from,ep003
966,downtown which is farther than they'd,ep003
969,like to be so now they're seeing another,ep003
972,option I'd if I another single-family,ep003
975,home and we are within the city limits,ep003
978,as you can see it wasn't that far of a,ep003
981,drive from where we're at currently,ep003
984,about 10 minutes so we're definitely,ep003
987,close to downtown,ep003
990,I see no brick it's not a French,ep003
993,Provincial type of home it's not,ep003
996,craftsman I mean there's wood but it's,ep003
999,all blue it's a very blue small house,ep003
1002,this is actually 1125 square feet so,ep003
1005,yeah it is a small house the only thing,ep003
1008,is the price is 255 so it is a little on,ep003
1011,the high side over budget and that's,ep003
1014,"over my max budget of $250,000 so I",ep003
1017,don't know this is pushing it a little,ep003
1020,bit I like that we're inside the city,ep003
1023,but Wow I think what you see the inside,ep003
1026,I'm gonna win back your friendship okay,ep003
1029,oh I love it,ep003
1032,it's cute is it glam enough for you this,ep003
1035,glam this is me this is her I want to,ep003
1038,like give you out this home is,ep003
1041,definitely a chanita home it screams,ep003
1044,glam this really speaks to her aesthetic,ep003
1047,not so much mine,ep003
1050,it has a dark floors it does have dark,ep003
1053,wood floors which I absolutely love it's,ep003
1056,open that's really real high ceilings,ep003
1059,the floors aren't six different colors,ep003
1062,exactly I was not expecting this there's,ep003
1065,no dining room area but it opens right,ep003
1068,out to the kitchen right have a bar here,ep003
1071,where you can sit and eat okay,ep003
1074,I really like the appliances in here it,ep003
1077,looks like that you know everything has,ep003
1080,been updated and a white kitchen it,ep003
1083,works in this space for sure and they,ep003
1086,did a really great job with details so,ep003
1089,even though it's 250 five thousand,ep003
1092,dollars you can tell that they put a lot,ep003
1095,of money into the upgrades and I don't,ep003
1098,have to upgrade anything exactly you,ep003
1101,know this person has really really,ep003
1104,really good style,ep003
1107,really good this kitchen is absolutely,ep003
1110,fabulous I think it's the perfect,ep003
1113,kitchen I am in love with it,ep003
1116,we're missing a fireplace Jonathan yeah,ep003
1119,this home doesn't have a fireplace it is,ep003
1122,one the negatives off the kitchen is the,ep003
1125,backyard oh wow there's a lot of space,ep003
1128,out here yes I really like this deck,ep003
1131,this is really nice and I see the,ep003
1134,dry-weight extends out here it's all,ep003
1137,your cars oh because true it's kind of,ep003
1140,like a carport they head back inside to,ep003
1143,see the bedrooms and bathrooms sneaker,ep003
1146,this would be your bathroom look at this,ep003
1149,door sliding door here oh that's,ep003
1152,different that's different I like the,ep003
1155,style even though the Shelf is cute with,ep003
1158,the plants it's perfect for me yeah,ep003
1161,let's take a look inside you bedroom,ep003
1164,here it's not too big but not so small,ep003
1167,yeah all right let's go to the master in,ep003
1170,the hall,ep003
1173,I mean it's definitely not as big of a,ep003
1176,master as the other rooms that we've,ep003
1179,been seeing I don't know I guess I could,ep003
1182,work with this space it's a little bit,ep003
1185,small okay,ep003
1188,so really updated there's not that much,ep003
1191,space I mean comparing all the other,ep003
1194,bathrooms that we've seen that was part,ep003
1197,of the master it's not that much space,ep003
1200,but it is functional space and this,ep003
1203,closet this is a true walk-in I like it,ep003
1206,my budget is 250 thousand this is two,ep003
1209,hundred and fifty five thousand but I,ep003
1212,will say that this is a beautiful house,ep003
1215,once we've stepped inside it's downtown,ep003
1218,and more so in the area that we want we,ep003
1221,just have some things to think about,ep003
1224,[Music],ep003
1227,they've seen several options that could,ep003
1230,be a good fit for them so to make their,ep003
1233,choice,ep003
1236,they'll have to factor in price location,ep003
1239,and type of home a lot of them have,ep003
1242,perks and cons to them,ep003
1245,[Music],ep003
1248,they say the oldest sisters the wisest,ep003
1251,most younger sister Jen is in the market,ep003
1254,in Atlanta for her first home within her,ep003
1257,"250,000 dollar budget and her big sister",ep003
1260,Janica will be living with her but it's,ep003
1263,time for them to make a decision,ep003
1266,remember the city view condo that we saw,ep003
1269,"right downtown nice skyline $229,000",ep003
1272,yeah honestly very affordable it is,ep003
1275,within your budget and it is the perfect,ep003
1278,location however it is not a house it's,ep003
1281,a condom yeah there's gonna be HOA fees,ep003
1284,but the hardwood floors I absolutely,ep003
1287,loved and you could still have the,ep003
1290,carpet inside of each of the rooms,ep003
1293,that's right in that loft area was I,ep003
1296,just loved it that other home that we,ep003
1299,saw with the big updated kitchen yes,ep003
1302,that one was really cool and that was,ep003
1305,two hundred and twenty-five thousand,ep003
1308,dollars it was definitely a lot of space,ep003
1311,even though the location isn't where we,ep003
1314,want it it's such a huge home and a huge,ep003
1317,backyard it is outdated it does not,ep003
1320,touch on either one of our Styles there,ep003
1323,is that other house that I really liked,ep003
1326,is the open layout house that's two,ep003
1329,hundred and fifty five thousand dollars,ep003
1332,it's not the city views but it's a lot,ep003
1335,closer than the big kitchen house you're,ep003
1338,right it is a lot closer we're still,ep003
1341,right in the thick of things and it was,ep003
1344,totally updated you're right but I do,ep003
1347,have to take on the flip side of that,ep003
1350,we're paying for those upgrades right up,ep003
1353,front,ep003
1356,two hundred and fifty five thousand,ep003
1359,dollars that's five thousand dollars,ep003
1362,over my max budget I think we have to,ep003
1365,come to a decision and I think I know,ep003
1368,what our decision might be,ep003
1371,I think we're gonna go for the city view,ep003
1374,condo yeah that city view is amazing,ep003
1377,it's all about the location we have to,ep003
1380,be downtown I thought it was all about,ep003
1383,the house but that's about the closest,ep003
1386,to the city we are going to get within,ep003
1389,the price range I definitely need to go,ep003
1392,ahead and put in my offer you know I,ep003
1395,don't think so,ep003
1398,I think we're almost done okay the condo,ep003
1401,"listed for $229,000 I was able to get",ep003
1404,the home for two hundred and twenty four,ep003
1407,thousand dollars so five thousand,ep003
1410,dollars under if I was really excited,ep003
1413,about that and we closed a month later,ep003
1416,and then one month after that we moved,ep003
1419,in so it's been about a month living,ep003
1422,here it's been great,ep003
1425,the biggest compromises we are not in a,ep003
1428,house we are in a condo but I'm happy to,ep003
1431,have my own bedroom and bathroom in my,ep003
1434,privacy and we're right downtown and,ep003
1437,we're right downtown it is a dream,ep003
1440,location I love everything about this,ep003
1443,house it is definitely hitting a lot of,ep003
1446,things on my wish list the fireplace the,ep003
1449,hardwood floors the character the,ep003
1452,Craftsman style is just all around just,ep003
1455,a great place that I think is perfect,ep003
1458,for our first home Sam and is I think,ep003
1461,he's more excited about the space than,ep003
1464,we are right I always hear his feet,ep003
1467,pitter-patter and running up and down,ep003
1470,the stairs playing around in the loft,ep003
1473,area hey buddy,ep003
1476,yeah this is Ben he's made the loft,ep003
1479,space his own room it's always been my,ep003
1482,dream to own a property to have a place,ep003
1485,that's mine I'm a little proud of myself,ep003
1488,so this is what it was all about I mean,ep003
1491,this is it can't get any better,ep003
1494,[Music],ep003

168,very chaotic but it's a lovely City it's,ep004
171,a very romantic city you can go out your,ep004
174,front door and you'll feel loved by,ep004
177,every little Piazza that you go to in a,ep004

183,large city but in reality it's not it is,ep004

243,to have a walk-in closet he's Italian so,ep004
246,he takes a precious space in my clothes,ep004
249,let's see if I can get because it would,ep004
252,be nice then an open kitchen he would,ep004
255,like a terrorist or just an open space,ep004
258,out space could be a garden or a terrace,ep004
261,and also furnish because we are just,ep004
264,moving in and we don't have any okay so,ep004
267,an interest yes and what is your budget,ep004
270,our budget is fourteen hundred you a,ep004
273,state okay well with this budget is,ep004
276,gonna be definitely the challenge yeah,ep004
279,in Rome the apartments are a little,ep004
282,quirky you're not gonna get everything,ep004
285,we're gonna have to give up some things,ep004
288,but let's see what I can find you okay,ep004
291,so my plan is to show them a little bit,ep004
294,of everything,ep004
297,this apartment is in the Coliseum area,ep004
300,which is right in the historical city,ep004
303,center would be easy for Alessandro to,ep004
306,get to work but not green at all okay so,ep004
309,this area is the Colosseum which is just,ep004
312,down the street close to the Metro so,ep004
315,that's good for you Oh Sandro and public,ep004
318,bus transportation so it'll be very easy,ep004
321,for you to get to the airport okay this,ep004
324,is a lovely building two bedrooms two,ep004
327,bathrooms it has sort of open concept,ep004
330,okay how about your ice it does not have,ep004
333,any balcony or terrace space though it's,ep004
336,a little bit over budget by a bit what,ep004
339,"do you mean it's $1,600 a month so let's",ep004
342,go take a look okay here we are,ep004
345,it's lovely and look at the ceiling,ep004
348,really really nice because it's full of,ep004
351,light the furniture is just good I knew,ep004
354,you'd love it let's go look at the,ep004
357,kitchen,ep004
360,when I entered in apartment he really,ep004
363,was impressed because it has this,ep004
366,beautiful floor the ceiling it's really,ep004
369,nice I would definitely go for a greener,ep004
372,area because I like waking up and see,ep004
375,some trees somewhere or some birds,ep004
378,chirping somewhere that makes me really,ep004
381,happy it's small for me that I cook a,ep004
384,lot but I like it it has an oven the,ep004
387,stovetop even a dishwasher Oh,ep004
390,a lot of places in Rome don't have that,ep004
393,yes a little separate room with the,ep004
396,washing machine the refrigerator a,ep004
399,microwave so it's a decent-sized kitchen,ep004
402,here we have a bedroom,ep004
405,it's beautiful is it the master bedroom,ep004
408,this could be the master bedroom this is,ep004
411,their closets in this room I don't see,ep004
414,no this room doesn't have a closet it's,ep004
417,so so this one full of light beautiful,ep004
420,okay this room has some special features,ep004
423,for you was a baby room this is your,ep004
426,closet just for the shoes okay well that,ep004
429,could be for your shoes,ep004
432,there's closet space up above okay and,ep004
435,what's here this is your walk-in closet,ep004
438,come take a look at big closet is,ep004
441,amazing there's a small space that you,ep004
444,can put all the makeup and everything,ep004
447,and we can hang the coat so Alison the,ep004
450,house is very nice also the location is,ep004
453,perfect is in the city center in,ep004
456,historical part of the city so I like it,ep004
459,maybe one thing is definitely there,ep004
462,like about the wrath of a balcony or an,ep004
465,open space open door space and so of,ep004
468,course that's a bit beyond our budget,ep004
471,what do you think I've grown up with,ep004
474,service great so seeing so many,ep004
477,buildings it's such a little bit my,ep004
480,taste if we are gonna spend as much,ep004
483,money we want to have an outdoor space,ep004
486,Peter growing up in Kenya is used to,ep004
489,being surrounded by greenery and I'd,ep004
492,really like to be able to give that to,ep004
495,her but in the center of Rome it's a,ep004
498,little difficult Tina goes for that open,ep004
501,space this is the best part of the,ep004
504,apartment I'm excited to show you but,ep004
507,it's not where Alessandro wants to be on,ep004
510,the negative side it may be a little bit,ep004
513,noisy after five years in love but,ep004
516,living apart Lita and Alessandro are,ep004
519,settling in Rome where they'll be,ep004
522,married oh my god it's unbelievable,ep004
525,hello I'm afraid because it's a big step,ep004
528,for me but I choose love and I only,ep004
531,believe love wins I just moved to Rome,ep004
534,and I'm marrying a very handsome man,ep004
537,blue eyes from babies he's bald,ep004
540,Alessandro he is Italian so yeah I'm in,ep004
543,July they may be in love but their house,ep004
546,hunt began with a conflict I would live,ep004
549,have a green space and out of this city,ep004
552,I would like to have it in the city,ep004
555,center instead I will be working here in,ep004
558,Rome house one in Rome's historic center,ep004
561,was Vitas first glimpse at apartment,ep004
564,living in a big city the furniture,ep004
567,really nice this is your walk-in closet,ep004
570,but while it's in a grand location house,ep004
573,1 has no outdoor space or Terrace,ep004
576,despite an over-budget asking price if,ep004
579,we are gonna spend as much money we want,ep004
582,to have an outdoor space,ep004
585,future husband will be very happy with,ep004
588,house - Tina tries to make them both,ep004
591,happy with a lower price and outdoor,ep004
594,space this is a trieste area of Rome or,ep004
597,surrounded by three different parks so,ep004
600,you'll be happy about that vita,ep004
603,and as you can see the via Libya here is,ep004
606,full of shopping this is the apartment,ep004
609,building ok it has a beautiful Terrace,ep004
612,how far you dudes from the city center,ep004
615,there's a metro station right here it's,ep004
618,about a minute walk I'll take you about,ep004
621,10 minutes and then there's also train,ep004
624,station Alessandro goes directly to the,ep004
627,oshino Airport so that's gonna be great,ep004
630,for you and so that is really well,ep004
633,connected it's 2 bedrooms it only has,ep004
636,one bathroom you may close it walk-in,ep004
639,closet space Vita what about the kitchen,ep004
642,a nice kitchen it's under budget it's,ep004
645,"$1,200 a month I think this house will",ep004
648,work well for Vita while I'm away,ep004
651,because it's in a lively neighborhood is,ep004
654,full of shops restaurants and on the,ep004
657,negative side it may be a little bit,ep004
660,noisy ok guys here's the apartment,ep004
663,beautiful hardwood floors don't you love,ep004
666,it,ep004
669,I don't know it's an a major shopping,ep004
672,street it's busy and I didn't like it so,ep004
675,much I saw their Terrace it's beautiful,ep004
678,it's spacious so for me it's a win high,ep004
681,ceilings semi-furnished personal touch,ep004
684,yeah this house a little bit 50/50 and,ep004
687,Melisandre tried to convince me also to,ep004
690,say that we can put some personal touch,ep004
693,to each to make it feel and look like,ep004
696,home so we're seeing a decision-making,ep004
699,process let's see how it goes let's come,ep004
702,this way and take a look,ep004
705,Alessandra at your kitchen it's a bit,ep004
708,narrow it's not but I see there's a lot,ep004
711,of storage is true there is a big work,ep004
714,area the only thing is that there's no,ep004
717,way we can fit in our table here to have,ep004
720,coffee in the kitchen we have the,ep004
723,terrace our breakfasts yeah lunch and in,ep004
726,winter we can have it in a living room,ep004
729,okay we both hoped for an open space,ep004
732,where the kitchen is also connected to,ep004
735,the living room so that we can cook and,ep004
738,at the same time being together with,ep004
741,guests this is the master bedroom nice,ep004
744,cozy in the high ceilings beautiful,ep004
747,sunlight yeah yes nice there's no,ep004
750,storage space or close it,ep004
753,the famous walk-in closet for you which,ep004
756,is right around the corner here and,ep004
759,there's a mirror there full-length,ep004
762,mirror look at all the space speed up,ep004
765,it's nice and there's a drawers here,ep004
768,girl does it like big closet I didn't,ep004
771,come with so many clothes from Kenya but,ep004
774,with time I know myself I will buy some,ep004
777,things this is the bathroom okay so,ep004
780,weird that's the shower yes where the,ep004
783,toilet is,ep004
786,so we can be here at the same time okay,ep004
789,I would like to have a more renovated,ep004
792,apartment new modern I mean addition I'd,ep004
795,like to see a bigger kitchen this is the,ep004
798,best part of the apartment,ep004
801,you're green space it's perfect so what,ep004
804,do you think of the apartment in whole I,ep004
807,love veterus the living room not so sure,ep004
810,it's a little bit small the house in,ep004
813,general it's small the bathroom has a,ep004
816,weird setting but it's close to the,ep004
819,metro and they transfer to the airport,ep004
822,for a lei and don't forget the price,ep004
825,it's under budget we have the terrorists,ep004
828,we have the parks near here jumping,ep004
831,straight as you say the kitchen is a bit,ep004
834,narrow and small but there is plenty of,ep004
837,workspace,ep004
840,Veta finally gets the green space she,ep004
843,wants,ep004
846,isn't that beautiful it's beautiful but,ep004
849,there's a downside with one bedroom I,ep004
852,don't know how we're going to manage so,ep004
855,my love let me take your own room it's,ep004
858,the most beautiful city in the unit,ep004
861,we've been in a long-distance,ep004
864,relationship for five years nice being,ep004
867,with someone for five years in a,ep004
870,long-distance relationship is more easy,ep004
873,you can only decide to do that if you're,ep004
876,sure that it's the right pace and I,ep004
879,think Alessandro for sure is the right,ep004
882,person for me they may be in love but in,ep004
885,many ways Vita and Alessandro are still,ep004
888,strangers we've been together for five,ep004
891,years but we spent actually together,ep004
894,only 52 days because I was always,ep004
897,traveling it's a big step for me it's,ep004
900,also a big step for him so we are all,ep004
903,new to this let's hope that reports out,ep004
906,now with his new position based in Rome,ep004
909,they're beginning life together in one,ep004
912,of the world's great cities come my,ep004
915,fiance,ep004
918,yes their house hunt began in Rome's,ep004
921,historic district oh my god beautiful,ep004
924,okay so this area is the Colosseum yeah,ep004
927,which is just down the street with a,ep004
930,fully furnished two-bedroom apartment,ep004
933,look at the beautiful exposed ceiling,ep004
936,full of lights freelance but the busy,ep004
939,city center location is an ideal for,ep004
942,Vida I would love to have that green,ep004
945,space out of this city and it has,ep004
948,drawbacks they both agree on if we are,ep004
951,gonna spend as much money we want to,ep004
954,have an outdoor space so with house -,ep004
957,Tina steered the hunt to a more,ep004
960,affordable neighborhood and the one,ep004
963,wishlist priority they both want this is,ep004
966,the best part of the apartment I'm,ep004
969,excited to show you your green space,ep004
972,Vita still has doubts I would really,ep004
975,like to see green immediately outside,ep004
978,their door and in addition I'd like to,ep004
981,see a bigger kitchen this place brings,ep004
984,me a lot of memories and I wanted to,ep004
987,bring here here so we'll find a house,ep004
990,around here we'll find a house around,ep004
993,here it depends very nice and green and,ep004
996,lovely to get Vita the green she wants,ep004
999,Tina takes the hunt to a more suburban,ep004
1002,setting but a couple of priorities are,ep004
1005,missing so this areas in Monteverde,ep004
1008,which means green so as you can imagine,ep004
1011,it's full of greenery does it have two,ep004
1014,bedrooms it's one bedroom one bathroom,ep004
1017,only one bedroom it is smaller yes but,ep004
1020,"we're way under budget at $1,000 a month",ep004
1023,with one bedroom I don't know how we're,ep004
1026,going to manage and what about the,ep004
1029,connection to the airport even though,ep004
1032,we're the closest to the airport at this,ep004
1035,apartment it's about an hour and 10,ep004
1038,minutes to get there with the bus and,ep004
1041,the tram but if you have a car it's only,ep004
1044,about 15 minutes depending on traffic of,ep004
1047,course has a beautiful Terrace oh,ep004
1050,there's a charity race a terrorist oh,ep004
1053,okay okay okay great let's let's see my,ep004
1056,guest coming from Kenya it's a long,ep004
1059,journey to come and then they have to go,ep004
1062,sleep in a hotel no I'd like them to,ep004
1065,sleep in my house come on in look how,ep004
1068,green it is very green unlike a,ep004
1071,particular color green wraparound,ep004
1074,Terrace and villa palm feel ease right,ep004
1077,over there yes,ep004
1080,that beautiful beautiful my dream home,ep004
1083,in Rome is somewhere green because I,ep004
1086,grew up where everything was Green and I,ep004
1089,love the green eyes of a neighborhood,ep004
1092,it's a green area but it's,ep004
1095,geographically close to the airport but,ep004
1098,it's very difficult to reach the airport,ep004
1101,because there are no public,ep004
1104,transportation and these are clauses,ep004
1107,these are the closet Wow,ep004
1110,can I say sleaze it's really beautiful,ep004
1113,yes so this is the bedroom it's,ep004
1116,beautiful yeah look up there's some,ep004
1119,storage space,ep004
1122,it's nice clean modern there is a lot of,ep004
1125,light coming in the house the bedroom is,ep004
1128,also very spacious I really liked it the,ep004
1131,kitchen small very small it's a bit,ep004
1134,difficult to cook here there's no place,ep004
1137,where you can cut vegetables it was,ep004
1140,looking nice but it was not practical so,ep004
1143,there's no space to do all the cooking,ep004
1146,that we do and there is space only for,ep004
1149,one person here's the bathroom and the,ep004
1152,shower so what are your thoughts about,ep004
1155,this apartment I love it it's new it's,ep004
1158,our burn it's something that I would,ep004
1161,like to live in with Alessandro it's,ep004
1164,green the view is amazing big windows,ep004
1167,there's only one bedroom it's a small,ep004
1170,batteries and open space here open space,ep004
1173,in the room but bad side of it is that,ep004
1176,it's not very well connected and it's,ep004
1179,away to the I put it it's easy if we,ep004
1182,need to buy a car in order to make it,ep004
1185,easier and Sondra additional costs that,ep004
1188,I have to consider it will be difficult,ep004
1191,but I think we'll make a decision lots,ep004
1194,of green space and a $400 a month,ep004
1197,savings I,ep004
1200,their house in Monteverde but he sees,ep004
1203,things differently if I have to go every,ep004
1206,week or every two weeks the airport I,ep004
1209,need something that is really easy for,ep004
1212,me when they first met five years ago,ep004
1215,Alessandro and Vita knew it was,ep004
1218,something special,ep004
1221,Rita and I met in Kenya when I was,ep004
1224,working there and I know that it was,ep004
1227,love at first sight they've kept their,ep004
1230,romance alive for five years although,ep004
1233,they've rarely been together,ep004
1236,I work as a humanitarian aid worker I've,ep004
1239,been working in refugee camps around the,ep004
1242,world now with his job based in Rome,ep004
1245,Vita has joined him and they're hunting,ep004
1248,for their first home starting with a,ep004
1251,two-bedroom apartment near Rome's,ep004
1254,Coliseum I mean that's housed at the,ep004
1257,Coliseum was really nice I really liked,ep004
1260,it was in a perfect location maybe a,ep004
1263,little bit busy but very nice and way,ep004
1266,over the budget house too was away from,ep004
1269,the city center and had its own outdoor,ep004
1272,space the terrace is to die for,ep004
1275,so we'll have a little fun if you settle,ep004
1278,for that house it has two bedrooms like,ep004
1281,we wanted and yeah it's a nice closet,ep004
1284,lots of storage room was not really a,ep004
1287,furnace,ep004
1290,but while walking around I think I've,ep004
1293,seen the potential we're a little,ep004
1296,personal touch we can really make it our,ep004
1299,place house 3 had a bargain price and,ep004
1302,plenty of green if you used to make,ep004
1305,green the only con that I have for this,ep004
1308,house is that it's one bedroom didn't,ep004
1311,like the kitchen I think it was well,ep004
1314,presented and then the other thing is it,ep004
1317,seems to me that those were public trans,ep004
1320,oh you need a car and that's an,ep004
1323,investment if we have to do,ep004
1326,she's additional money,ep004
1329,[Music],ep004
1332,among the tria would exclude the one,ep004
1335,right in the city center because it's,ep004
1338,way above a cohesive way above yeah and,ep004
1341,then you're writing the city center so,ep004
1344,there's no green area there's nothing,ep004
1347,around it yeah so immediately that Sun,ep004
1350,is out,ep004
1353,now we have to choose difficult what is,ep004
1356,your favorite between these two houses,ep004
1359,the one in Monteverde and the one in,ep004
1362,green the open space between the bedroom,ep004
1365,and the sitting room,ep004
1368,it's lovely had the biggest closet of,ep004
1371,all day but I need to have another baby,ep004
1374,for sure so for me I don't know I,ep004
1377,convinced you promising you that we are,ep004
1380,going to put a very personal touch we,ep004
1383,bring all the nice things from Kenya,ep004
1386,okay and put them in their house in,ep004
1389,Trieste which is the one with the big,ep004
1392,Tara's okay we will buy plants and we,ep004
1395,can make it our green area outside in,ep004
1398,the terrace and we give a personal touch,ep004
1401,this house and I think it has good,ep004
1404,potential and we need another bedroom,ep004
1407,for the gas yeah and because it has a,ep004
1410,big terrorist I think we can bring,ep004
1413,outside inside and put some plans to,ep004
1416,make it look nice the kitchen it has a,ep004
1419,lot of its narrow yes but he has a lot,ep004
1422,of white space it's practical and it,ep004
1425,would make a good space for our first,ep004

96,oldest is seven then we have a six year,ep005
99,old a three year old and a three month,ep005
102,old I got a one two three go our,ep005
105,schedule is a lot of slang you know,ep005
108,cleaning up messes just a lot a lot of,ep005
111,family time you're ready let's go oh,ep005
114,yeah,ep005
117,the reason why we're moving is because,ep005
120,we've outgrown this house we have six,ep005
123,people sharing three bedrooms and it,ep005
126,gets very crowded we really need a,ep005
129,bigger house at this point the more,ep005
132,bedrooms the better,ep005
135,10:12 if it's worth doing it's worth,ep005
138,overdoing,ep005
141,we'd like to have six seven bedrooms so,ep005
144,with their four hundred and forty,ep005
147,thousand dollar budget,ep005
150,they're searching here in Canton a town,ep005
153,45 minutes north of Atlanta with just,ep005
156,the type of large homes they're looking,ep005
159,for but agreeing on a style will be,ep005
162,another matter,ep005
165,I'll see that one that's what I'm,ep005
168,talking about,ep005
171,it's a Craftsman style that I really,ep005
174,like I love the earth tones like the,ep005
177,natural colors the Greens the Browns I,ep005
180,know you're looking for a farmhouse I,ep005
183,just like the style of a farmhouse the,ep005
186,big wraparound porch just how cozy and,ep005
189,warm it feels but there is one thing,ep005
192,they both agree on I would love it to be,ep005
195,move-in ready we really don't want to do,ep005
198,much you have a lot of children plus I'm,ep005
201,incompetent I don't know how to do,ep005
204,anything,ep005
207,Lisa would also like an updated all,ep005
210,white or gray kitchen and Dustin wants a,ep005
213,home office with a special feature I,ep005
216,have an incredible space in the basement,ep005
219,I put a urinal in the basement because I,ep005
222,could the two best decisions I've made,ep005
225,my life one was to marry Lisa and two of,ep005
228,the prettier line know the best second,ep005
231,best decision of my life,ep005
234,I think whatever house we find we just,ep005
237,have to have enough space for them to,ep005
240,play outside right isn't that a huge,ep005
243,priority,ep005
246,oh yeah the more we can get them outside,ep005
249,and wearing each other out outdoors the,ep005
252,better as far as I'm concerned we got a,ep005
255,lot of great warm weather here in the,ep005
258,south I would love to have a pool I've,ep005
261,never lived anywhere with a pool it'd be,ep005
264,great for the kids Elijah has some,ep005
267,pretty significant developmental delays,ep005
270,is a sensory space for Elijah would be,ep005
273,great something that can be his where he,ep005
276,can go have some quiet time that's a,ep005
279,smaller space would be great do you have,ep005
282,any butter yes that's good thank you,ep005
285,we're also really hopeful in this new,ep005
288,house that we will be able to have a,ep005
291,space for my sister to come in love with,ep005
294,us we are only a year apart so we've,ep005
297,been relased us our entire lives but it,ep005
300,needs to be something separate like,ep005
303,finished basement with a kitchen and I,ep005
306,want like everything someone will she,ep005
309,can go and live independently and pay,ep005
312,rent because we want to be like the,ep005
315,closest of neighbors I'm super excited,ep005
318,that Lisa and Dustin are willing to,ep005
321,allow me to come into their house I love,ep005
324,their children I'm obsessed with all of,ep005
327,them so I'm super pumped about just,ep005
330,being close to them this is basically,ep005
333,the worst time to move we have a newborn,ep005
336,and our three children are just crazy so,ep005
339,we really shouldn't be moving right now,ep005
342,so it really has to be a great,ep005
345,opportunity for it's huge it's a big,ep005
348,house,ep005
351,first up Lisa Dustin and Leslie are,ep005
354,seeing a home that the couple's agent,ep005
357,picked with Lisa in mind hey guys I,ep005
360,picked this for you because I know you,ep005
363,really wanted a large front porch and,ep005
366,more of that farmhouse style yes it's so,ep005
369,warm like this is where our family would,ep005
372,grow up this is exactly what I imagined,ep005
375,to have the big porch that beautiful,ep005
378,farmhouse look I'm so excited about it,ep005
381,I'm certainly looking for a,ep005
384,craftsman-style house and this is not,ep005
387,that it is definitely a farmhouse style,ep005
390,so this home is seven bedrooms four and,ep005
393,a half bathrooms ha ha listed at for,ep005
396,$40.99 this is the top of our budget but,ep005
399,it's doable the market in the Atlanta,ep005
402,metro area is definitely hot,ep005
405,but even though the inventory is low in,ep005
408,their price point you can definitely get,ep005
411,a lot of house for the money so families,ep005
414,loved it here this home has HOA fees it,ep005
417,comes with a swim and tennis and of,ep005
420,course they maintain all of the common,ep005
423,areas so does that mean there's not a,ep005
426,pool in the house itself not on this one,ep005
429,all right well let's take a look the,ep005
432,floors I like I really like the dark,ep005
435,floors yeah I like the detailing that,ep005
438,goes around the edges that's pretty cool,ep005
441,off the entry is a formal living room in,ep005
444,a formal dining room that leads to the,ep005
447,kitchen this is beautiful it is it's,ep005
450,gorgeous it's not the white and the gray,ep005
453,that I wanted but this shaker it's I,ep005
456,mean these are pretty I don't know like,ep005
459,these black countertops I'm not loving,ep005
462,what like what do you think about the,ep005
465,dark I think it was it being at the top,ep005
468,of our budget you're gonna have to like,ep005
471,it well in the truth is this house is,ep005
474,really move-in ready yeah we could live,ep005
477,here right now the kitchen opens onto an,ep005
480,eat-in area and the backyard sort of you,ep005
483,know this has to be the smallest door,ep005
486,I've ever seen in my life Wow feels like,ep005
489,you're in the trees it's like you're in,ep005
492,little tree house is that an actual tree,ep005
495,house huge,ep005
498,I know this can't be the kid's playroom,ep005
501,all the way out here yeah absolutely,ep005
504,oh I like the two stories I think it's,ep005
507,really nice I like the wood,ep005
510,I like this nice and open whoa look at,ep005
513,this aquarium I wish that would stay the,ep005
516,kids would love this baby would love it,ep005
519,down the hall is a large master bedroom,ep005
522,and bath these upgrades,ep005
525,the countertops that's a cold granite,ep005
528,color yeah,ep005
531,next they head down to the basement to,ep005
534,see a possible space for Leslie oh yeah,ep005
537,oh wow I mean it's a beautiful area but,ep005
540,I don't know how I would use this space,ep005
543,so my thoughts are this could be easily,ep005
546,converted into a kitchenette and then,ep005
549,picture this as your living room okay I,ep005
552,know but this is not move-in-ready like,ep005
555,we're talking yeah but let's look in,ep005
558,here I mean it looks like a really nice,ep005
561,bedroom oh wow this is really nice I,ep005
564,don't love the basement in this house,ep005
567,for Leslie having to create a whole new,ep005
570,kitchen it would work it's just it's not,ep005
573,ideal oh wow although I like this space,ep005
576,I can do this we're good convert the bar,ep005
579,into a kitchen yeah I can make it work,ep005
582,absolutely they head upstairs to the,ep005
585,second floor to see an office for Dustin,ep005
588,and four more bedrooms for the kids this,ep005
591,bedroom is really cool a child's dream,ep005
594,yeah well I'd you could get his own,ep005
597,little sensory spaces Oh perfect yeah,ep005
600,like we could sleep down here have some,ep005
603,sensory room up there I think would be,ep005
606,perfect,ep005
609,this is a lot of house y'all yeah,ep005
612,[Applause],ep005
615,well you know I really like the style I,ep005
618,love the port I really like the upstairs,ep005
621,all those bedrooms really more bedrooms,ep005
624,that we expected to get I think that,ep005
627,would be ideal,ep005
630,what about the basement we could change,ep005
633,that up we had two let's just gonna put,ep005
636,us over budget so now they're headed to,ep005
639,a less expensive home it's three 90999 I,ep005
642,like that a lot does that mean that,ep005
645,we're gonna have to do some work to it,ep005
648,yeah one of Lisa's top wishlist items on,ep005
651,her and her family's Georgia house hunt,ep005
654,is a place that has living quarters for,ep005
657,her sister Leslie so far they've seen a,ep005
660,house with a basement that could work,ep005
663,but needed renovations and while Lisa,ep005
666,liked the homes farmhouse look her,ep005
669,husband Dustin has another style in mind,ep005
672,now that is a good-looking house it's a,ep005
675,nice craftsman-style house has a lot of,ep005
678,really cool details I like that it's not,ep005
681,a farm house it doesn't have the big,ep005
684,wraparound porch this is definitely more,ep005
687,my house you're gonna love the price,ep005
690,it's three 90999 I like that a lot does,ep005
693,that mean that we're gonna have to do,ep005
696,some work to it there's a slight project,ep005
699,but why don't we head inside and you can,ep005
702,take a look all right this is great off,ep005
705,the entry is a formal dining room a den,ep005
708,and the entrance to the great room it's,ep005
711,like you can see all of nature from here,ep005
714,no pool and it's pretty steep so it,ep005
717,doesn't even look like we could pull it,ep005
720,in there but there is an HOA with a,ep005
723,community pool well we would love a pool,ep005
726,we also know that that's a big ask to,ep005
729,get everything that we're hoping for but,ep005
732,at least I can pack them up and we don't,ep005
735,have to go far to swim and spend our,ep005
738,summers in that pool the eatin area I,ep005
741,mean I feel like that would totally work,ep005
744,I mean it's really open like that I feel,ep005
747,like is a huge deal to have people to,ep005
750,see the kids while we're cooking in the,ep005
753,cabinets there they're quality they're,ep005
756,nice cabinets just they're not the gray,ep005
759,or the white it's the lighter colors,ep005
762,that I was hoping for well let me be,ep005
765,honest about the kitchen I mean it is,ep005
768,totally workable right but it's not what,ep005
771,I want,ep005
774,I wonder again at this price point it,ep005
777,definitely could paint maybe but that's,ep005
780,just one more thing we'd have to do next,ep005
783,to the kitchen is a possible office for,ep005
786,Dustin with a full bath I mean there's,ep005
789,no urinal in here but it's pretty good,ep005
792,[Music],ep005
795,yeah they head upstairs to see the,ep005
798,bedrooms so this is the smallest of all,ep005
801,the bedrooms we could use this for,ep005
804,Centauri space really Jeff yeah I think,ep005
807,that's a good option,ep005
810,Oh double doors I like it spacious yeah,ep005
813,this is big on this floor are two more,ep005
816,full baths and three bedrooms for the,ep005
819,kids,ep005
822,I loved there were so many bedrooms,ep005
825,upstairs it just seemed like upstairs,ep005
828,was definitely a win for our family but,ep005
831,the basement might be another story this,ep005
834,is interesting do I sleep here huge,ep005
837,"think about it this way it's 1,800",ep005
840,square feet nice finish it out any way,ep005
843,you'd like okay it's dubbed for a,ep005
846,bathroom and you could probably put a,ep005
849,kitchen in - I do like that I could make,ep005
852,it uniquely me this house is way under,ep005
855,budget and for the money that we can,ep005
858,save on that we could do a lot of work,ep005
861,the basement though and we need to do,ep005
864,everything we need to put in walls we,ep005
867,need to put in plumbing it's gonna be a,ep005
870,lot of work I am concerned about the,ep005
873,basement and Leslie space about how,ep005
876,we're gonna get everything done in a,ep005
879,timely manner so that we can all move in,ep005
882,together this yard is what I love about,ep005
885,this house the landscape is beautiful I,ep005
888,just wish there was more usable space,ep005
891,back here and maybe if there was room,ep005
894,for a pool or if there already was a,ep005
897,pool that'd be pretty awesome you've,ep005
900,definitely given us a lot to think about,ep005
903,cuz it is a great house like when you,ep005
906,look upstairs that there's all those,ep005
909,bedrooms yeah and the house is beautiful,ep005
912,it's definitely that Craftsman style I,ep005
915,love the colors but really like we,ep005
918,wanted a house that was as little work,ep005
921,as possible and even though it's way,ep005
924,under budget it's gonna take a lot of,ep005
927,money to get this we're up and running,ep005
930,the way we would like it so their agents,ep005
933,found a place that's a little more,ep005
936,move-in ready,ep005
939,but that comes at a price the seller,ep005
942,just reduced the price to 499 nine,ep005
945,that's the that reduced it to $4.99,ep005
948,budget,ep005
951,[Music],ep005
954,one two three with a budget of 440,ep005
957,thousand dollars Dustin and Lisa are on,ep005
960,the hunt for a home that's big enough,ep005
963,for their family of six plus Lisa's,ep005
966,sister Leslie so far they've seen a,ep005
969,"5,500 square foot farmhouse style place",ep005
972,"for Lisa and a 4,200 square foot",ep005
975,craftsman for Dustin but neither home,ep005
978,had the pool they want for their kids,ep005
981,today they're seeing a colonial-style,ep005
984,home that's the biggest yet it's fifty,ep005
987,nine hundred square feet six bedrooms,ep005
990,six and a half bathrooms huge that's a,ep005
993,big house the seller just reduced the,ep005
996,price to $4.99 nine reduced it to $4.99,ep005
999,that is way over budget $4.99 is just,ep005
1002,way over what we were comfortable,ep005
1005,"spending $60,000 is a lot of money and",ep005
1008,I've got a lot of kids that I need to,ep005
1011,feed typically I don't like to show my,ep005
1014,buyers properties that are above their,ep005
1017,budget but in this case there's probably,ep005
1020,a little bit of room for negotiations as,ep005
1023,long as the rent doesn't go up don't get,ep005
1026,your home it's not the Craftsman style,ep005
1029,that I was looking for right and it's,ep005
1032,not really a farmhouse style either but,ep005
1035,it does have a large enough front porch,ep005
1038,that you could put plenty of furniture,ep005
1041,out here it's not huge but it could work,ep005
1044,you can go throughout the whole house,ep005
1047,think that's beautiful,ep005
1050,to be honest though it's really not as,ep005
1053,grand as I would have thought it would,ep005
1056,be walking up to the house I mean it's a,ep005
1059,yeah off the entry is a large formal,ep005
1062,dining room and the great room area but,ep005
1065,what I love is the windows I mean it's,ep005
1068,like the whole wall is Windows well and,ep005
1071,it opens up right into the kitchen okay,ep005
1074,so the backsplash it's not painted,ep005
1077,cabinets it's not white but this faucet,ep005
1080,is really underwhelming I think I need,ep005
1083,to get you a faucet it is kind of rich,ep005
1086,people problems really thing that,ep005
1089,delivers fresh drinking water into my,ep005
1092,home is not,ep005
1095,but it's really not very nice it's like,ep005
1098,a lot of the house it's a big house and,ep005
1101,has a lot of space but some of the,ep005
1104,finishes are lacking here next to the,ep005
1107,kitchen is a screened-in porch and a,ep005
1110,possible office for Dustin with its own,ep005
1113,bathroom on the second floor they see,ep005
1116,the bedrooms for the kids each with its,ep005
1119,own bathroom and the master suites so,ep005
1122,there's a hallway and the master suite,ep005
1125,you have a double vanity this bathroom,ep005
1128,is gigantic this shower is huge but,ep005
1131,there's just it's nothing too overdone,ep005
1134,in here around the corner is a potential,ep005
1137,sensory area for their son Elijah honey,ep005
1140,yeah I think it'd be really cool just an,ep005
1143,away space for him sound machine maybe,ep005
1146,yeah,ep005
1149,next they head downstairs to check out,ep005
1152,the basement all right let's say this,ep005
1155,area is all about you girl all right so,ep005
1158,this is your bedroom okay awesome,ep005
1161,what about the wall colors down here,ep005
1164,nice job it's an easy fix the basement,ep005
1167,also has a big living area and a kitchen,ep005
1170,Wow a little much lime green not feeling,ep005
1173,it that's bold my first impression was,ep005
1176,WOW the color I'm not in love with the,ep005
1179,kitchen but I mean I probably could get,ep005
1182,it for that so the bathroom over here,ep005
1185,very spacious I think this is nice,ep005
1188,alright there's a bonus coming oh yeah I,ep005
1191,like bonuses,ep005
1194,hey this isn't just a pool this is like,ep005
1197,a style I really love there's a pool out,ep005
1200,the back we really wanted it just for,ep005
1203,our budget we didn't think that was,ep005
1206,gonna be a possibility I mean it's like,ep005
1209,more than we were even asking for which,ep005
1212,i think is why the price tag is more,ep005
1215,than we were even asking for I just,ep005
1218,think we have a lot to talk about,ep005
1221,because less this apartment it's it's,ep005
1224,complete you know like paint what it,ep005
1227,will paint you know that's fine,ep005
1230,the bedrooms are huge okay and also keep,ep005
1233,in mind the fixtures really weren't that,ep005
1236,nice and this pulls a kind of murky is,ep005
1239,not in the best shape I don't know what,ep005
1242,that's gonna cost to fix it it's a lot,ep005
1245,of added cost is it worth an extra,ep005
1248,"$60,000 for a house that still doesn't",ep005
1251,have everything that we want yeah that's,ep005
1254,a little crazy and now after seeing,ep005
1257,several options none of them hitting all,ep005
1260,the points on the family's wish list,ep005
1263,it's time for Lisa and Dustin to make a,ep005
1266,decision these biscuits are awesome we,ep005
1269,have more serious things to talk about,ep005
1272,those in biscuit,ep005
1275,with a budget of 440 thousand dollars,ep005
1278,Dustin and Lisa have been looking to buy,ep005
1281,a large family home in Canton Georgia,ep005
1284,they've seen several options now it's,ep005
1287,decision time these biscuits are awesome,ep005
1290,I'm so excited about this right now I,ep005
1293,think we have more serious things to,ep005
1296,talk about though than this kid I love,ep005
1299,the farm because it had that huge porch,ep005
1302,it was beautiful,ep005
1305,yeah that's really wasn't my style but,ep005
1308,it was beautiful though I'll give you,ep005
1311,that,ep005
1314,the upstairs is perfect like I love that,ep005
1317,loft area for Elijah back in me his,ep005
1320,little escape you know the one thing,ep005
1323,about that farmhouse at 449 9 even,ep005
1326,though it's at the top of our budget,ep005
1329,there's not really a lot of changes we,ep005
1332,need to make to it I do think there are,ep005
1335,some major changes to that basement,ep005
1338,because there's not a kid chamber Leslie,ep005
1341,and we'd have to do a lot of work to,ep005
1344,that basement now I want to talk about,ep005
1347,that craftsman at 399 9 that was way,ep005
1350,under budget and it was a beautiful,ep005
1353,house it was really charming especially,ep005
1356,there's so many bedrooms upstairs like,ep005
1359,more than we you didn't even need the,ep005
1362,basement there like Leslie space we were,ep005
1365,not thinking oh let's go completely,ep005
1368,build something from scratch and that's,ep005
1371,what I would take in the house,ep005
1374,you know adding a urinal is a treat to,ep005
1377,you by guys but what about the colonial,ep005
1380,"and 499,000 it was a lot of money it was",ep005
1383,way over budget I think that pool it's,ep005
1386,like it's exactly what we want but it's,ep005
1389,gonna take some work to even get it,ep005
1392,functional and we're some this is so,ep005
1395,over budget so to think about having to,ep005
1398,put more money in we definitely have to,ep005
1401,make the basement is crazy it's just a,ep005
1404,little thing but I'm worried that kinda,ep005
1407,so which one will they choose,ep005
1410,I think about everything that we need it,ep005
1413,seems like our quality of life like our,ep005
1416,day-to-day living would be best in that,ep005
1419,colonial you know what that colonial,ep005
1422,just has a room for everybody and you,ep005
1425,know really the things we don't like,ep005
1428,about the house or things that we can,ep005
1431,change over time so I think we're gonna,ep005
1434,have to call on Amy and see if she can,ep005
1437,get that price down right so we're,ep005
1440,something we can actually afford we,ep005
1443,ended up going with a colonial home,ep005
1446,which was listed for $4.99 but Amy did,ep005
1449,an amazing job and got it for us for 475,ep005
1452,and so we got a great deal on this house,ep005
1455,we've been here for two weeks and it has,ep005
1458,been a complete whirlwind I really,ep005
1461,wanted a home that was a hundred percent,ep005
1464,looser than ready and it just wasn't the,ep005
1467,case with this house it was just small,ep005
1470,changes a lot of the lights weren't,ep005
1473,working,ep005
1476,most of the toilets weren't working out,ep005
1479,yeah the pool had to be completely,ep005
1482,drained refilled and a lot of the,ep005
1485,equipment replaced but we're excited and,ep005
1488,like every day it feels more and more,ep005
1491,like home so we're settled we also don't,ep005
1494,just have enough bedrooms but there's,ep005
1497,huge bedrooms so the kids can grow into,ep005
1500,them the sensory space here is actually,ep005
1503,perfect we just needed a little nook for,ep005
1506,him just to have a little getaway spot,ep005
1509,you know I didn't get a urinal but I did,ep005
1512,get a bedroom on the main level I've,ep005
1515,already got set up as an office I think,ep005
1518,for me it was so important that that,ep005
1521,Leslie space was already done even if,ep005
1524,it's a little bit crazy I definitely,ep005
1527,think I'm one with this house I think,ep005
1530,with the new paint colors it looks,ep005
1533,gorgeous the green countertops are still,ep005
1536,here the gray walls are helping a little,ep005
1539,bit and I'm definitely figuring out how,ep005
1542,to make this bar area me is that go,ep005
1545,[Music],ep005
1548,and then the cool kids can be loud they,ep005
1551,can play and splash it's just so amazing,ep005
1554,out there happy birthday,ep005
1557,it's actually Elijah's birthday today he,ep005
1560,wanted to have a pool party at the house,ep005
1563,what do they go home to think of this is,ep005
1566,a dream home it's more than that this is,ep005
1569,a house where our boys can grow into,ep005
1572,young men is where our daughters can,ep005
1575,grow into young women and this is a,ep005
1578,great space for us to be,ep005
1581,[Music],ep005
12,[Music],ep006
15,was a huge fire I love it,ep006
18,rich and Lauren are buying their first,ep006
21,home in Richmond Virginia and he in,ep006
24,particular is looking for a move-in,ep006
27,ready classic I love the colonial feel I,ep006
30,love the detail cap molding chair,ep006
33,railing this would be perfect for a,ep006
36,formal living room we don't really need,ep006
39,for mullen living though she'd prefer a,ep006
42,quirky charmer she can put her stamp on,ep006
45,it's a little outdated but I could do my,ep006
48,thing in here that just makes it more,ep006
51,homey to me but in the end it might come,ep006
54,down to which house has the most,ep006
57,versatile features look at this is so,ep006
60,cool I have the strong urge to traverse,ep006
63,it,ep006
66,[Music],ep006
69,we're keeping a good pace my name's rich,ep006
72,I'm 29 years old I'm a development,ep006
75,officer and I'm Lauren and I'm 27 years,ep006
78,old and I am a high school English,ep006
81,teacher why don't we get breakfast after,ep006
84,this yeah we met actually through a,ep006
87,dating app this was the first date that,ep006
90,I went on I knew it was one of her first,ep006
93,ones and we decided to stick with it,ep006
96,even though she spilled a beer on her,ep006
99,first date and harrypotter joke went,ep006
102,right over my head we got engaged about,ep006
105,a year and a couple months after and,ep006
108,we've been married for almost a year,ep006
111,oh nothing like Houston GT we live in,ep006
114,Houston Texas on Rice University's,ep006
117,campus because we're resident associates,ep006
120,Ras home sweet home they do this in,ep006
123,addition to their full-time jobs we,ep006
126,interact with the students we live with,ep006
129,the students we eat with the students,ep006
132,are you guys doing the mentor situation,ep006
135,and we get to help them become the,ep006
138,adults that they're going to be we love,ep006
141,it but you know the apartment itself is,ep006
144,small it's a two-bedroom one-bath and,ep006
147,there's absolutely no storage this is,ep006
150,our massive bedroom and here we is the,ep006
153,only closet space we had as we grow our,ep006
156,family which we'll be starting soon,ep006
159,weight and we're ready for a new,ep006
162,adventure I won't miss this we've,ep006
165,decided to move to Richmond Virginia to,ep006
168,be closer to Rich's parents he's lined,ep006
171,up another fundraising job and she's,ep006
174,looking for a teaching position I'm,ep006
177,excited because I haven't lived there,ep006
180,since I was in high school and I'm from,ep006
183,Houston and I've never looked anywhere,ep006
186,else so I'm really excited for a new,ep006
189,change here's to a successful journey,ep006
192,Richmond's got a great food scene it's,ep006
195,still the south and it's got that,ep006
198,southern charm and hospitality you know,ep006
201,what you see here that you don't really,ep006
204,see in Houston lightning bugs well,ep006
207,there's a little bit milder and these in,ep006
210,season what does that even mean now that,ep006
213,they've moved to Richmond they have to,ep006
216,hash out a few details before starting,ep006
219,their house hunt I'm just so excited,ep006
222,y'all are here they're staying with,ep006
225,Rich's parents while on the hunt which,ep006
228,could take a while since these two don't,ep006
231,agree on much I'm looking for exactly,ep006
234,this my dream home would be a,ep006
237,traditional colonial and suburbia,ep006
240,because that's what I grew up with,ep006
243,I'm county opposite from rich I am,ep006
246,really looking for something that has a,ep006
249,lot more character in the city very East,ep006
252,Coast look you know maybe a little Cape,ep006
255,Cod what's your budget if we could get,ep006
258,something that's like 350 I would love,ep006
261,that because then I could put my spin on,ep006
264,things if that means knocking down walls,ep006
267,and putting in new floors I want to make,ep006
270,a home my own I'm willing to spend,ep006
273,"$450,000 for a turnkey home that's fleet",ep006
276,renovation I don't think that we're,ep006
279,ready for that I've never knock down a,ep006
282,wall it could be fun it would be fun,ep006
285,taking it down and then what do we do,ep006
288,well they do agree on hardwood floors,ep006
291,the homes layout is a point of,ep006
294,contention,ep006
297,I love how traditional homes have the,ep006
300,you know separate formal living separate,ep006
303,dining because each room can then have,ep006
306,its own character I think open concept,ep006
309,is best for starting a family we can see,ep006
312,the little ones you know that we will,ep006
315,have some day running around and just,ep006
318,more room to host we love having friends,ep006
321,over I really would love to have that,ep006
324,hosting space like a big kitchen and,ep006
327,would be wonderful if it could be like,ep006
330,white like yours,ep006
333,they want the entertaining space to,ep006
336,extend out back and have room for their,ep006
339,other family member that's the spot oh,ep006
342,yeah I would love close to an acre,ep006
345,because we are very fortunate enough to,ep006
348,have a Schnauzer poodle mixes Schnoodle,ep006
351,and her name is Elaine a large master,ep006
354,suite with tons of closet spaces another,ep006
357,must-have one thing that is a 100% need,ep006
360,is a double vanity a laundry room and,ep006
363,two-car garage round out the list well,ep006
366,we really got to get this home search,ep006
369,going soon because we don't want to,ep006
372,overstay our welcome at Richard's,ep006
375,parents house and we're just ready to,ep006
378,get into our own space and start this,ep006
381,next chapter of our lives,ep006
384,first up a home in the city their agent,ep006
387,picked with Lauren in mind this is,ep006
390,definitely myself looks a little small,ep006
393,but it's got the brick that you like,ep006
396,nice front porch I love this part so,ep006
399,cute,ep006
402,it's the perfect Cape Cod looks and I,ep006
405,was looking for it hey guys so we've got,ep006
408,the charm and character on this one,ep006
411,right,ep006
414,doesn't look huge from the outside but,ep006
417,it's actually three thousand fifteen,ep006
420,square feet really the best part about,ep006
423,it is we're actually under budget three,ep006
426,thirty four nine hundred Wow all right,ep006
429,well let's go check it out it's the,ep006
432,first thing that you see and I just,ep006
435,don't think that's attractive at all I,ep006
438,think it's charming the whole house has,ep006
441,been redone okay I mean we're talking,ep006
444,new windows the floors look gorgeous no,ep006
447,crown molding that's okay I mean good,ep006
450,natural light I mean this is this is,ep006
453,open-concept this would be good for,ep006
456,having all of our friends over and and,ep006
459,when we saw our family you know line of,ep006
462,sight yeah so is this the dining room,ep006
465,yeah this is the only real kind of,ep006
468,dining space there look at stats I want,ep006
471,to form what I do yeah the Cape Cod,ep006
474,floor plans really specific so it,ep006
477,doesn't always have those formal spaces,ep006
480,that a lot of other floor plans have,ep006
483,gosh I love this kitchen,ep006
486,I would love an all-white kitchen I love,ep006
489,the cabinets but you know there really,ep006
492,aren't a lot of cabinets and there's no,ep006
495,fridge yeah that's scary would have to,ep006
498,purchase but it's under budget yeah,ep006
501,everything's turnkey I think and it's my,ep006
504,style yeah oh wow now we're talking kind,ep006
507,of small for a backyard though I would,ep006
510,love an acre,ep006
513,yeah it's about 4/10 of an acre for the,ep006
516,city it's a pretty big yard okay I know,ep006
519,you guys talked about having a garage,ep006
522,mm-hmm there's a big detached storage,ep006
525,shed it's not an actual garage though,ep006
528,yeah there's no driveway up to it the,ep006
531,space is here so if you ever wanted to,ep006
534,add one in the future and the Lots large,ep006
537,enough so with the budget being low we,ep006
540,could add that in pretty easily back,ep006
543,inside they see the laundry room then,ep006
546,head to the downstairs bathroom,ep006
549,I love the barn door that's pretty,ep006
552,spacious I don't not much to do that,ep006
555,means that there's not really any way,ep006
558,for me to put my Flair on it you know,ep006
561,wrap around you're right we'll hit the,ep006
564,first floor bedroom oh okay good size,ep006
567,and it's on the first floor which is,ep006
570,good let's head down to the basement,ep006
573,guys,ep006
576,and takes us we don't have basements,ep006
579,welcome to hilly Virginia this is so,ep006
582,cool that's a huge basement great size I,ep006
585,love the floors it really is like a,ep006
588,whole another house down there I just,ep006
591,wish this was like one floor up yeah,ep006
594,husbands and the family room is a little,ep006
597,smaller this gives you a flex space but,ep006
600,it's down steep stairs which one to be,ep006
603,good wouldn't be good for children one,ep006
606,day my parents your parents me as I get,ep006
609,older there's also a full bath and,ep006
612,bedroom down here back to your staircase,ep006
615,right here they are right as you walk in,ep006
618,I like it I like the white I like the,ep006
621,stairs I just don't like the location,ep006
624,upstairs they see a secondary bedroom,ep006
627,then head to the master doors these are,ep006
630,so cool not really quite enough for all,ep006
633,of our self this wouldn't be much more,ep006
636,than what we had in the dorm,ep006
639,yeah oh wow that's a cool tub that's a,ep006
642,cool tub but only one vanity yeah there,ep006
645,are two of us now this door actually,ep006
648,goes back into the hallway so that's,ep006
651,gonna be the door that services the,ep006
654,bedroom the other bedroom I kinda want,ep006
657,to have the master bathroom just to us,ep006
660,yeah so this is definitely more my style,ep006
663,this home has all the charm and the,ep006
666,style that I really love and it's,ep006
669,definitely under our budget was just,ep006
672,fantastic yeah yeah the budgets a good,ep006
675,part but it's not my style but I do like,ep006
678,that it's move-in ready and I know you,ep006
681,like the kitchen yeah I love like the,ep006
684,colors and details but I really do wish,ep006
687,that there was more room yeah especially,ep006
690,in the art the living room is not big,ep006
693,enough for the square footage of the,ep006
696,house and I would really like something,ep006
699,closer to an acre and I don't know if,ep006
702,we're gonna find that in the city but a,ep006
705,bigger house in the suburbs comes at a,ep006
708,cost and that is the top we can't go,ep006
711,above that,ep006
714,[Music],ep006
717,so good to be in Richmond finally yeah,ep006
720,it's been great rich and Lauren are,ep006
723,moving from Houston to Richmond Virginia,ep006
726,and they're looking forward to the,ep006
729,change in scenery this is a really,ep006
732,beautiful park we love to be active,ep006
735,we're looking forward to getting out and,ep006
738,hiking a little bit more because there's,ep006
741,none of that really in Houston but then,ep006
744,getting those calories back all the good,ep006
747,restaurants with up to four hundred and,ep006
750,fifty thousand dollars to spend they've,ep006
753,seen a well-priced Cape Cod with a white,ep006
756,kitchen perfect for Lauren but it wasn't,ep006
759,Rich's colonial it didn't have a garage,ep006
762,or a formal dining room and he'd prefer,ep006
765,to be in the suburbs so today they're,ep006
768,outside the city to see one for rich I,ep006
771,love this location it's really for,ep006
774,happen to the south but it's it's the,ep006
777,suburban life I think that's what we,ep006
780,want I think that's best for starting,ep006
783,family we are way outside the city and,ep006
786,that's not really what I'm looking for,ep006
789,god this is enormous,ep006
792,are you kidding it's definitely my style,ep006
795,I love the brick I love the colonial,ep006
798,feel it out yet the exterior of the,ep006
801,house is exactly what I'm looking for,ep006
804,this is what I wanted when I envisioned,ep006
807,the house great to see you I think we,ep006
810,have a terrific house and four bedrooms,ep006
813,two and a half baths,ep006
816,"okay now what about price 450,000 okay",ep006
819,that's way beyond mine who that is the,ep006
822,top let's check it out and see what you,ep006
825,think okay,ep006
828,it is the top of their budget but I,ep006
831,think it could be their forever home,ep006
834,what is a huge foyer I love it this is,ep006
837,very formal this is exactly what I'm,ep006
840,looking for let me look at the detail,ep006
843,lookit like the chair wailing the,ep006
846,baseboards yeah formal exactly which is,ep006
849,not my style at all formal living room,ep006
852,is huge this is nice details I'm a,ep006
855,fireplace yeah I love that fireplace I,ep006
858,especially love the dental work on the,ep006
861,mantel it's a be perfect for a formal,ep006
864,living room yeah we don't really need,ep006
867,formal living though when we have kids,ep006
870,someday and that would be a room that,ep006
873,they wouldn't be able to enter and,ep006
876,that's not really ideal for the,ep006
879,comfortable family lifestyle that we,ep006
882,want to have what do you think about the,ep006
885,hardwoods I wish they were darker but we,ep006
888,do prefer hardwood,ep006
891,I really like him let's brighten things,ep006
894,up and head into the morning-room I love,ep006
897,the natural light but the paint color is,ep006
900,not my favorite although the house is at,ep006
903,the very top of our budget we can budget,ep006
906,for a canopy oh yes we are wide open to,ep006
909,the kitchen yes but it's a dark kitchen,ep006
912,I would say we could redo it,ep006
915,but this is at the top end this is the,ep006
918,best part of the kitchen a wine fridge,ep006
921,we just stock that up then you won't,ep006
924,even know the color of the kitchen will,ep006
927,be fine and you've got stainless steel,ep006
930,appliances and a refrigerator in this,ep006
933,home that's nice,ep006
936,well let's take a look outside okay oh,ep006
939,my god this is a huge deck welcome to,ep006
942,your own park like backyard,ep006
945,no one has like this in Texas what size,ep006
948,is the art exactly it's actually 0.89,ep006
951,acres so it's just under the acre that,ep006
954,you asked that's perfect,ep006
957,back inside they see the formal dining,ep006
960,room I do like the chair railing and I,ep006
963,feel like for a dining room it is a is a,ep006
966,big room but it's so closed off it kind,ep006
969,of feels stuffy and missing that open,ep006
972,concept that I really was looking for,ep006
975,the family room terrific this is really,ep006
978,where you get your drama oh my gosh oh,ep006
981,my gosh it's beautiful I have a strong,ep006
984,urge to traverse it love the wainscoting,ep006
987,too,ep006
990,this is a really unique room and this is,ep006
993,terrific too two-car garage oh my gosh,ep006
996,Wow this is I yeah this is big this is,ep006
999,bigger than our current apartment came,ep006
1002,from in there they see a laundry room,ep006
1005,and the powder room then head upstairs,ep006
1008,I like the the curve here in the landing,ep006
1011,so let's step into the upstairs hall,ep006
1014,bath okay wow this is really spacious,ep006
1017,and I love that it's a double vanity,ep006
1020,especially for a guest we don't see that,ep006
1023,they see three secondary bedrooms this,ep006
1026,is huge this is really big then head to,ep006
1029,the master this is really large oh my,ep006
1032,gosh oh good golly this is awesome the,ep006
1035,master closet is the most organized room,ep006
1038,I've ever stepped foot in and the master,ep006
1041,bath is completely updated yeah you can,ep006
1044,tell yeah the double vanity is really,ep006
1047,great yeah that's something we,ep006
1050,definitely want in a tub a tub to give,ep006
1053,Elaine baths wow I can get in there too,ep006
1056,okay,ep006
1059,what do you think I love it I love the,ep006
1062,layout of the home and I absolutely love,ep006
1065,the yard and I love that the hardwoods,ep006
1068,go all the way through it the big thing,ep006
1071,for me is that is the very very top of,ep006
1074,our budget but I think this house is,ep006
1077,worth going to the max budget because,ep006
1080,this house is completely turnkey that,ep006
1083,means that I can't do any project the,ep006
1086,kitchen is well done but it is not my,ep006
1089,white kitchen maybe we can keep looking,ep006
1092,and find something that I can maybe put,ep006
1095,my own spin on oh my god so next up is a,ep006
1098,home their agent thinks they can both,ep006
1101,get behind it's so classic yeah,ep006
1104,[Music],ep006
1107,dear family would love this Oh 100% rich,ep006
1110,and Lauren are moving from her native,ep006
1113,Houston to his native Richmond Virginia,ep006
1116,and are taking a break from house,ep006
1119,hunting to check out the sights around,ep006
1122,the state's capital we love that I have,ep006
1125,so much more historical context and I,ep006
1128,said but this was just our house with up,ep006
1131,to four hundred and fifty thousand,ep006
1134,dollars to spend they've seen a,ep006
1137,well-priced Cape Cod in the city,ep006
1140,perfect for Lauren but it didn't have a,ep006
1143,large backyard or a formal dining room,ep006
1146,and rich would prefer a colonial in the,ep006
1149,suburbs then they saw a large suburban,ep006
1152,colonial with a huge backyard for rich,ep006
1155,but it didn't have an open floor plan or,ep006
1158,a white kitchen for Lauren and it was at,ep006
1161,their max budget so today they're seeing,ep006
1164,a home their agent thinks may be the,ep006
1167,perfect compromise I would rather be in,ep006
1170,town but I love this house oh my gosh,ep006
1173,look at the front porch is very cute I,ep006
1176,like the black shutters so classic yeah,ep006
1179,I'm doing great how are you again a,ep006
1182,little warm outside the house details,ep006
1185,inside the best part about it is it's,ep006
1188,only three hundred and twenty-five,ep006
1191,thousand Wow that's fantastic,ep006
1194,here's your chance to do some of those,ep006
1197,projects we've been talking about cool,ep006
1200,well look we'll start right here this is,ep006
1203,our formal dining room yeah hardwood,ep006
1206,floors yeah he's a beautiful I love the,ep006
1209,detail crown molding chair railing so,ep006
1212,the great room really kind of formal,ep006
1215,colonial with living room dining room on,ep006
1218,the opposite sides okay it's got the,ep006
1221,carpet it's not bad necessarily yeah it,ep006
1224,can be fixed on I do like the fireplace,ep006
1227,and the detail with that well this opens,ep006
1230,wide open into the screened porch which,ep006
1233,is really really nice,ep006
1236,Green porch wow that's fantastic come on,ep006
1239,out cool look there's a it's too,ep006
1242,expensive,ep006
1245,oh wait do you know how much chlorine,ep006
1248,costs a nice spot yeah I mean on the,ep006
1251,screen porch we could seriously have,ep006
1254,dinner out he ranked every night yeah,ep006
1257,and you still have some additional space,ep006
1260,probably a little under a half acre okay,ep006
1263,I'd still rather have closer to an acre,ep006
1266,the yards not quite as large as I would,ep006
1269,like but what they've done with it is,ep006
1272,nice the kitchen is,ep006
1275,pretty large yeah I mean it's white yeah,ep006
1278,it's a little outdated yes it is but I,ep006
1281,mean I could I could do my thing in here,ep006
1284,write it through 25 you have a lot more,ep006
1287,room to make those changes yeah I could,ep006
1290,have a lot of fun in here they see a,ep006
1293,half bath off the kitchen updating,ep006
1296,definitely needed yeah then check out,ep006
1299,the garage they converted it over to,ep006
1302,office space but it can convert back,ep006
1305,pretty easily yeah we'd want to convert,ep006
1308,it back into a garage probably that's it,ep006
1311,cool right what's up there well it's,ep006
1314,upstairs let's check it out all right,ep006
1317,interesting carpets yeah rip that out,ep006
1320,too,ep006
1323,and this is one of your upstairs,ep006
1326,bathrooms okay is it a fool oh there's a,ep006
1329,full bath well yeah we would definitely,ep006
1332,want to update all of this so we could,ep006
1335,do that yeah it is in the budget next up,ep006
1338,is the master bedroom,ep006
1341,interesting color and interesting very,ep006
1344,extravagant crown molding and for being,ep006
1347,the master suite it feels very small,ep006
1350,okay I mean not enormous but not,ep006
1353,definitely bigger than what we have it,ep006
1356,yeah and then your master bathroom is,ep006
1359,here this is a small master bath only,ep006
1362,one vanity and definitely would want to,ep006
1365,change this out but we could do that so,ep006
1368,yeah I would look forward to redoing all,ep006
1371,of it,ep006
1374,they see the laundry area and two,ep006
1377,secondary bedrooms this is my bedroom,ep006
1380,yeah this was that space you were seeing,ep006
1383,from downstairs it could be like having,ep006
1386,officer oh yeah,ep006
1389,this is a massive bedroom this is one of,ep006
1392,the thoughts I would have is if you took,ep006
1395,that loft space cut through this wall it,ep006
1398,might be a nice setup for a whole nother,ep006
1401,master so yeah no that's a really great,ep006
1404,idea,ep006
1407,okay another project but at that price,ep006
1410,point yeah room for project without is,ep006
1413,so fun I mean we could really make in,ep006
1416,our own this is a project that I can,ep006
1419,work on for a long time that just makes,ep006
1422,it more homey to me so tell me what you,ep006
1425,guys think of this one I really love the,ep006
1428,front of the house I mean I just think,ep006
1431,it's so picturesque,ep006
1434,I like the budget this house is 125,ep006
1437,thousand dollars less than our max,ep006
1440,budget,ep006
1443,plus with all the projects that we would,ep006
1446,have to do I just feel like we would,ep006
1449,still equal our,ep006
1452,the very top of our budget and probably,ep006
1455,go over it but I like the project that's,ep006
1458,my favorite part,ep006
1461,Lauren could take this house and make it,ep006
1464,her own but nothing they have to do,ep006
1467,right away it's in move-in condition,ep006
1470,it's a big decision,ep006
1473,and there's lots to consider but,ep006
1476,ultimately the choice may come down to,ep006
1479,either Rich's large backyard or Lauren's,ep006
1482,white kitchen we need to make a decision,ep006
1485,soon,ep006
1488,[Music],ep006
1491,as sweet as your mom is I'm sure she,ep006
1494,would love for us to eventually find our,ep006
1497,own place yeah rich and Lauren have up,ep006
1500,to four hundred and fifty thousand,ep006
1503,dollars to buy their first home in,ep006
1506,Richmond Virginia after seeing several,ep006
1509,options it's decision time what did you,ep006
1512,think of the remodeled Cape Cod at 3:34,ep006
1515,nine it was definitely my style and it,ep006
1518,was closer to the city and the kitchen,ep006
1521,was beautiful the master bath was shared,ep006
1524,and Hall oh yeah,ep006
1527,there's no garage and the yard was,ep006
1530,smaller than I would like so then we,ep006
1533,"have the grand colonial at 450,000 time",ep006
1536,for our budget actually that's at the,ep006
1539,top of yours but it's way over mine but,ep006
1542,it does have a big yard and it's move-in,ep006
1545,ready,ep006
1548,there weren't any projects for me,ep006
1551,related you honestly speak that's like,ep006
1554,my dream house but it's so huge then we,ep006
1557,saw the the farmhouse yes which was the,ep006
1560,cheapest house at 325 yeah and it had,ep006
1563,all the room for projects but it's a lot,ep006
1566,of projects yeah I've got the cash to do,ep006
1569,it I really love the curb appeal porch,ep006
1572,the front porch was amazing I don't,ep006
1575,think that the house is big enough for,ep006
1578,us to grow into well we can't buy three,ep006
1581,houses so I'd be bad,ep006
1584,[Music],ep006
1587,you know which one I really love the,ep006
1590,grand colonial I mean I really have my,ep006
1593,heart set on the farmhouse fixer-upper I,ep006
1596,just feel like it's too many projects if,ep006
1599,I'm being honest it was a little,ep006
1602,overwhelming I can't believe I'm saying,ep006
1605,this that look colonial is I think I,ep006
1608,think it's a right decision really in,ep006
1611,the end of the day it makes no sense,ep006
1614,okay,ep006
1617,all right let's do it let's do it okay,ep006
1620,you ready yeah we made it to Richmond,ep006
1623,and we're in the grand colonial we got,ep006
1626,the keys a little over a month ago and,ep006
1629,we moved in about three weeks ago see,ep006
1632,that's what I'm talking about,ep006
1635,it is really neat to be a homeowner I,ep006
1638,mean it's cool to come home to our own,ep006
1641,place that we don't have to share with,ep006
1644,anybody else,ep006
1647,growing up my friend's parents had,ep006
1650,houses like this my parents had house,ep006
1653,like this this is you know whatever when,ep006
1656,I thought of my forever home the list,ep006
1659,"price was $450,000 and we offered it",ep006
1662,that this is over my budget but with all,ep006
1665,of the things for the most part being,ep006
1668,done it's okay I've started to realize,ep006
1671,that painting is actually quite enough,ep006
1674,of a project let's put some stuff on the,ep006
1677,stand great these things I've painted,ep006
1680,almost the entire downstairs ain't,ep006
1683,engaging furniture placement everything,ep006
1686,Lauren is in charge of that works okay,ep006
1689,that's good while this house wasn't my,ep006
1692,original choice in style it fit us best,ep006
1695,I mean for hosting my family and for,ep006
1698,when we grow our family what are you,ep006
1701,working on over there well I thought,ep006
1704,some cookies would be nice the kitchen,ep006
1707,isn't my dream kitchen but we can we can,ep006
1710,figure that out later got a built-in,ep006
1713,wine fridge,ep006
1716,yeah what else do you need Elaine loves,ep006
1719,her new home yeah then help me put some,ep006
1722,clothes away there's many more places to,ep006
1725,take naps oh yeah she naps in a,ep006
1728,different room every day,ep006
1731,I really love the yard it's been a lot,ep006
1734,of fun to tackle I haven't done yard,ep006
1737,work since high school really,ep006
1740,okay so shush kebabs yeah that sounds,ep006
1743,good,ep006
1746,grilling has been fun I'm learning how,ep006
1749,to perfect fillets and t-bone t-bone,ep006
1752,steaks are tough but I'm working on that,ep006
1755,all right what those go all right this,ep006
1758,is the first time I have lived outside,ep006
1761,of Texas and I've immediately felt at,ep006
1764,home here and I'm just thrilled that I,ep006
1767,get to share with her okay witnesses,ep006
1770,ours,ep006

21,for a unique house in Seattle this is a,ep007
24,strange box I hope you're not,ep007
27,vegetarians because the rumor has it it,ep007
30,used to be a meat market and while he,ep007
33,loves the idea of completely renovating,ep007
36,a space to make it sleek and modern sort,ep007
39,of picture just tearing down this room,ep007
42,opening it up you know she may not be on,ep007
45,the same page,ep007
48,I don't definitely is more of a,ep007
51,visionary I kind of get stuck on the,ep007
54,details she thinks a new build might be,ep007
57,the way to go the place looks like,ep007
60,brand-new construction that's the beauty,ep007
63,of this is you don't have to do a thing,ep007
66,but in the end will a chance at,ep007
69,waterfront living be the deciding factor,ep007
72,this is crazy that's really awesome,ep007
75,[Music],ep007

123,things and turned them into amazing,ep007
126,we're smart Adam hand-painted most,ep007
129,everything in here I did want to have a,ep007
132,striped French carnivalesque,ep007
135,theme I really enjoy putting a lot of,ep007
138,detail into everything to the excess,ep007
141,we're both big time collectors I think,ep007
144,the weird stuff like anything that's,ep007
147,weird I love this birdcage I want to put,ep007

153,a lot of odd antiques and carnival items,ep007
156,I do go to auctions and get these,ep007
159,vintage pieces the taxidermy I want to,ep007
162,get this eye thing okay and they're in,ep007
165,the right City for pursuing their quirky,ep007
168,interests we love sandals so much,ep007
171,there's so many amazing artists here,ep007
174,there's so much cool stuff to do there's,ep007
177,tons of restaurants popping up all over,ep007
180,the place and it's just a beautiful,ep007
183,place to live,ep007
186,I love that it's green that's the,ep007
189,Emerald City the only issue they've,ep007
192,outgrown their current home everything,ep007
195,is so compacted in here our house was,ep007
198,built in 1904 its craftsman one bathroom,ep007
201,that's a very tiny that's can you just,ep007
204,let me get ready really fast,ep007
207,style-wise they're also ready to take a,ep007
210,break from all this color and overall,ep007
213,busyness even though we love our style,ep007
216,the way our house is now it can be very,ep007
219,overwhelming so we like to keep a little,ep007
222,bit more of a toned down version of it,ep007
225,we need to declutter our lives a little,ep007
228,bit so this time around they want a,ep007
231,sleek and contemporary interior I would,ep007
234,love to have a large,ep007
237,in modern space with white walls clean,ep007
240,lines yeah that's one thing we can,ep007
243,absolutely agree on it they're open on,ep007
246,exterior appearance as long as it's,ep007
249,unique we are not looking for your,ep007
252,standard house we do not want the white,ep007
255,picket fence the coldest ACK if it was,ep007
258,some kind of a industrial space or a,ep007
261,commercial space one thing that would be,ep007
264,really nice would be a really large,ep007
267,studio as well I have a lot of items in,ep007
270,storage it'd be an extra bonus if there,ep007
273,was some kind of outbuilding art studio,ep007
276,something at least two bedrooms at least,ep007
279,one full-size bathroom attached so,ep007
282,hopefully our bedroom and then another,ep007
285,earliest half bath having space I could,ep007
288,actually work a little bit would be cool,ep007
291,with the two bedrooms through hoping one,ep007
294,could be a bedroom slash home office for,ep007
297,me even in our house currently when we,ep007
300,do have people over everybody of course,ep007
303,hangs out in the kitchen for the parties,ep007
306,at we'd like to have a really big,ep007
309,kitchen yeah I'm looking for hardwood,ep007
312,floors we hate carpet yeah no carpet,ep007
315,ever you know it would be dope though,ep007
318,rooftop patio that's what I've always,ep007
321,said we live in such a beautiful area,ep007
324,that it only makes sense that if you're,ep007
327,gonna live here you might as well have a,ep007
330,great view what do you want what's the,ep007
333,most important part it'd be great to,ep007
336,have a big backyard we have a awesome,ep007
339,pitbull rescue that we love he needs,ep007
342,space uh-huh,ep007
345,roam around it one thing we definitely,ep007
348,need is a big bathtub for bear,ep007
351,the bathtub is bears happy place and,ep007
354,while he doesn't mind being a little,ep007
357,farther out she wants to be within 15,ep007
360,minutes of work commuting back and forth,ep007
363,and the terrible's stale traffic is just,ep007
366,not something that's worth my time,ep007
369,the house was insanely expensive if we,ep007
372,want something move-in ready,ep007
375,"and spend you know close to 700,000 but",ep007
378,if we find something the decent price,ep007
381,range we're willing to,ep007
384,I'm to work and put the work in yeah,ep007
387,when I walk into a space or house I feel,ep007
390,like I can normally envision it pretty,ep007
393,quickly I can see beyond like what's,ep007
396,there a lot of the time I'm total upset,ep007
399,it takes a lot for me to see the big,ep007
402,picture and how it will work out first,ep007
405,up a mixed-use space close to downtown,ep007
408,it's nice that this place is really,ep007
411,close to work yeah sloughed look at this,ep007
414,a lot of glass well it's there because,ep007
417,this is actually a storefront it's a,ep007
420,legal commercial space you could live,ep007
423,work you could have a gallery here you,ep007
426,could do all kinds of things it's got 12,ep007
429,foot ceilings cool yeah two bedrooms and,ep007
432,the price so high but it's 598 for this,ep007
435,new construction,ep007
438,thank you what you can do here you're,ep007
441,looking for something maybe where you,ep007
444,could use to store some of your artwork,ep007
447,it could be fun to have it here it looks,ep007
450,like a storage container for me it's,ep007
453,modern it's hip I like the modern yeah,ep007
456,so upstairs others carpet so we're gonna,ep007
459,have to put some booties on our feet the,ep007
462,main floor space I really like it I like,ep007
465,the metal on the glass I like the modern,ep007
468,I would probably set up an art studio,ep007
471,some kind of a shop oh there's a public,ep007
474,restroom down here yeah well it is dumb,ep007
477,commercial and so we have to have a,ep007
480,compliant bathroom down here yeah I make,ep007
483,sense,ep007
486,yeah they head upstairs to see the,ep007
489,living quarters this would be your,ep007
492,living room and dining area kitchen area,ep007
495,yeah it's cool there's a balcony but,ep007
498,there's no yard is there no yard there,ep007
501,is a bird there's a dog walk park just a,ep007
504,few blocks away he doesn't like dogs I,ep007
507,do like the floors no place that's like,ep007
510,brand-new construction that's the beauty,ep007
513,of this is you don't have to do a thing,ep007
516,it's totally moving condition yeah I,ep007
519,like the countertops I think they're,ep007
522,nice stainless steel appliances which,ep007
525,are great I like the white cabinets yeah,ep007
528,I do like that it's will you stuff you,ep007
531,know it looks like so clean we're just,ep007
534,cool I mean there's certain things like,ep007
537,don't like like the backsplash is super,ep007
540,ugly,ep007
543,I hate that this is electric there is a,ep007
546,half bath around the corner oh yeah and,ep007
549,it's nicely done,ep007
552,upstairs they see the first bedroom then,ep007
555,they see a full bath like the color,ep007
558,yeah they tied it all in with the colors,ep007
561,downstairs that'll be sure in a second,ep007
564,here it's bigger than our current,ep007
567,bathroom sort of barrel can't really,ep007
570,jump in there not at all now I want to,ep007
573,show you the master it's tiny it's like,ep007
576,you can't even fit a king-size bed in,ep007
579,here what about the carpet - well we'll,ep007
582,pull that up right away like the patio,ep007
585,remember we wanted a rooftop patio this,ep007
588,isn't exactly a rough one,ep007
591,walk-in closet I mean I couldn't walk in,ep007
594,there thanks I guess I think our walk-in,ep007
597,closet that we want might have to be,ep007
600,that other bedroom I really like the,ep007
603,clean lines the glass the metal the,ep007
606,modern fixtures it's cool you just think,ep007
609,don't have to do anything you know like,ep007
612,up kind of awesome I like the,ep007
615,neighborhood it's really close to work,ep007
618,it's a really short commute which is,ep007
621,really nice the patios are maybe okay or,ep007
624,there I'm gonna it's not like you can,ep007
627,like just the bathroom or anything,ep007
630,there's the old backyard not really any,ep007
633,work for us we have people over to,ep007
636,entertain at all you have that pool live,ep007
639,work studio downstairs that could be a,ep007
642,great party space is there something,ep007
645,more unique or quirky that we can see,ep007
648,Mandy yeah I think I can find you,ep007
651,something like that since they want,ep007
654,quirky this next place could do or maybe,ep007
657,not this is a strange box,ep007
660,you know we love old stuff like this,ep007
663,artsy couple Adam and Kaylee are looking,ep007
666,for a unique home in Seattle with space,ep007
669,to show off their collectibles with a,ep007
672,"$700,000 budget they've seen a live-work",ep007
675,space with room for a gallery on the,ep007
678,first floor and the modern style they,ep007
681,want the place was totally move-in ready,ep007
684,and close to the bar they owned but it,ep007
687,was small and there was no yard now,ep007
690,they're seeing a larger place but it's a,ep007
693,full 25 minutes from their business it's,ep007
696,just really far away that's very,ep007
699,residential I like it,ep007
702,oh this could be it this is a strange,ep007
705,box I like the doors this is really,ep007
708,awkward though like right on the busy,ep007
711,road it's kind of hideous it does we'll,ep007
714,definitely look like it used to be a,ep007
717,store or something it's really weird,ep007
720,well I know it's really unusual I hope,ep007
723,you're not vegetarians because the rumor,ep007
726,has it it used to be a meat market and a,ep007
729,grocery store,ep007
732,oh it's got three bedrooms and one 3/4,ep007
735,bath and you're gonna love the price,ep007
738,it's 399 950 that's great Wow originally,ep007
741,built in 1948 but someone's remodeled it,ep007
744,over the years is that a wet bar over,ep007
747,there it is a beautiful wood top oak not,ep007
750,really beautiful skidding ceilings are,ep007
753,great yeah,ep007
756,windows are super tiny there's carpet,ep007
759,this way this is a really ugly room well,ep007
762,you know you can remodel you said you,ep007
765,weren't scared of a fixer no I'm,ep007
768,definitely I like the idea I see,ep007
771,potential,ep007
774,it's the sort of picture just already,ep007
777,tearing down this room opening it up you,ep007
780,know this place is pretty far from,ep007
783,modern however I see these walls going,ep007
786,away and being open this could be a,ep007
789,modern structure Adam definitely is more,ep007
792,of a visionary so he can kind of picture,ep007
795,how he would redo it I kind of get stuck,ep007
798,on the details like the little windows,ep007
801,and so he's trying to explain it but I'm,ep007
804,still a little confused,ep007
807,obviously it used to be a child's room,ep007
810,carpets horrible this room is horrible,ep007
813,basically they head upstairs to see,ep007
816,another bedroom it's like a bed platform,ep007
819,you just put your man,ep007
822,hop up here it's it's your lovely,ep007
825,balcony it's like a mudroom but when you,ep007
828,step out there I think we might have a,ep007
831,mountain view out here though take a,ep007
834,look at some of these built-ins that,ep007
837,they have weird why would you put these,ep007
840,here is this legal,ep007
843,I know back downstairs they see the main,ep007
846,living quarters it looks like they kind,ep007
849,of tried to do a little bit of,ep007
852,remodeling in here as opposed to the,ep007
855,risk loss you know at least hardwood,ep007
858,floors instead of carpet throughout yes,ep007
861,a beautiful maple in the kitchen it's a,ep007
864,little rough but I know you can use your,ep007
867,imagination oh my god these are,ep007
870,definitely really insanely all four oh,ep007
873,my gosh weird,ep007
876,these are definitely really old oh,ep007
879,that's all yeah yeah there's some mold,ep007
882,for sure complete got me yeah but look,ep007
885,at the great backyard it's huge fair,ep007
888,love us Wow,ep007
891,yeah it's got a huge dad the yard is,ep007
894,actually average size but it looks a lot,ep007
897,larger because the property is built so,ep007
900,close to the street yeah seems good back,ep007
903,inside they see a full bath like in the,ep007
906,hallway good for the dog sinker that's,ep007
909,kind of a redeeming quality about the,ep007
912,worst,ep007
915,well upstairs is another bedroom so this,ep007
918,could be like the master bath won't you,ep007
921,take a look at this third bedroom is,ep007
924,that where the beds supposed to go Oh,ep007
927,welcome to the 80 I could see a future,ep007
930,dad a rooftop and more lovely carpet I,ep007
933,guess it could be worse,ep007
936,yeah maybe I don't understand this at,ep007
939,all I'm so confused,ep007
942,it's not modern I see you know just,ep007
945,opening all this up so much work though,ep007
948,I mean it's cool that there's like,ep007
951,really high ceilings and it's big,ep007
954,the yard is amazing it's massive the,ep007
957,location the mountain,ep007
960,linked the locations good you show us,ep007
963,something that maybe is less renovations,ep007
966,you mean something not quite a fixer yes,ep007
969,but still unique so they're brokers,ep007
972,lined up a home that needs less work but,ep007
975,she may not be able to get her clients,ep007
978,through the front door worlds brownest,ep007
981,house the house is exquisitely,ep007
984,horrendous we've been here so much,ep007
987,lately yeah maybe a little prayer,ep007
990,photographing wall newly engaged Seattle,ep007
993,couple Adam and Kaley are on the hunt,ep007
996,"for a house with a budget of $700,000",ep007
999,they've seen a modern live-work condo,ep007
1002,near downtown with a gallery space for,ep007
1005,their art but no yard for their pooch,ep007
1008,then they saw a larger place 25 minutes,ep007
1011,from their jobs downtown it had a huge,ep007
1014,yard and was well priced but it was a,ep007
1017,complete fixer now they're meeting their,ep007
1020,broker at another place 30 minutes from,ep007
1023,downtown,ep007
1026,oh this is so weird world's brownest,ep007
1029,house I'm so glad you made it,ep007
1032,your dollar goes further and out here,ep007
1035,and I know you like unusual and,ep007
1038,whimsical settings so the house itself,ep007
1041,is two bedrooms one and a half baths the,ep007
1044,price is four hundred thousand a okay,ep007
1047,that's not bad,ep007
1050,looking at the house is exquisitely,ep007
1053,horrendous not either Kaley or my style,ep007
1056,at all I don't think wow yeah Wow much,ep007
1059,brighter up here kind of a low clearance,ep007
1062,to acoustic ceilings for popular in the,ep007
1065,70s not so popular anymore just exciting,ep007
1068,part is right outside the window,ep007
1071,what in the world oh my god it's,ep007
1074,waterfront Oh can you believe it yeah,ep007
1077,this is crazy it's really high and fast,ep007
1080,right now it's really awesome yeah we,ep007
1083,can see the river from the inside with,ep007
1086,the big door round out here listen to,ep007
1089,rock and roll down closer to the river,ep007
1092,there's a little boat launch,ep007
1095,whoa-oh a boat launch so awesome yeah,ep007
1098,there's a place you can put in a kayak,ep007
1101,that's so cool Robo yeah you can,ep007
1104,actually swim this wall could have so,ep007
1107,many people out here it's like throwing,ep007
1110,parties and stuff it's pretty sure about,ep007
1113,the freeway it's so cool out here they,ep007
1116,head back inside,ep007
1119,so obviously here's the living room and,ep007
1122,dining room combination,ep007
1125,not about size out yeah worse they,ep007
1128,obviously did the countertops that don't,ep007
1131,feel like they really did the cupboards,ep007
1134,so it's sort of weird really matches in,ep007
1137,here they have sort of new appliances,ep007
1140,stainless steel I still don't look that,ep007
1143,bad we better we would definitely want,ep007
1146,to remodel yeah yeah the kitchen,ep007
1149,completely needs to be gutted and ripped,ep007
1152,out just for the modern style that we,ep007
1155,want,ep007
1158,I feel like this doesn't make the cut,ep007
1161,but the price is right for this house,ep007
1164,four hundred thousand dollars so that,ep007
1167,gives us three hundred thousand to,ep007
1170,remodel great it does have the bathroom,ep007
1173,off the kitchen looks like they,ep007
1176,obviously did countertops here same,ep007
1179,thing left the cupboards so what about,ep007
1182,bear I'm not sure if this tub would,ep007
1185,really Oh No well like it's all needs to,ep007
1188,go for sure yeah Kaleigh more toilet,ep007
1191,paper please they see a small bedroom,ep007
1194,before heading downstairs to see the,ep007
1197,first floor so this main floor here is,ep007
1200,completely finished and it could be your,ep007
1203,master this is so weird,ep007
1206,it's a little odd the carpets kind of,ep007
1209,gross you wouldn't large this half bath,ep007
1212,here yeah yeah and there's another room,ep007
1215,here it could be another bedroom an,ep007
1218,office or you could just take out this,ep007
1221,wall this is good potential action yeah,ep007
1224,they look at another bonus area,ep007
1227,so you have a workshop or you can use,ep007
1230,this as an art studio,ep007
1233,I like this I dig it,ep007
1236,ceilings are a little low but it's,ep007
1239,alright it does a lot of potential I,ep007
1242,think we could you know the price is,ep007
1245,right you have room in our budget to,ep007
1248,really do something cool here it's on,ep007
1251,the water fair would love the yard small,ep007
1254,the house itself is little small one of,ep007
1257,the only other things too is that it's,ep007
1260,kind of far away from work so I might be,ep007
1263,a problem after seeing several options,ep007
1266,it's time for them to decide the choice,ep007
1269,may come down to whether the house needs,ep007
1272,renovation has a big yard or as close to,ep007
1275,their jobs downtown I got a big decision,ep007
1278,here bar owners Adam and Kaylee are,ep007
1281,looking for a home in Seattle with a,ep007
1284,"budget of $700,000 they've seen several",ep007
1287,options and now it's time to decide all,ep007
1290,right so what did you think about the,ep007
1293,lost townhome I liked that it was newer,ep007
1296,construction it was nice that we didn't,ep007
1299,have to like do any renovations to it,ep007
1302,but there was no yard for bear was still,ep007
1305,in her budget price was five hundred,ep007
1308,ninety-eight thousand yeah but member,ep007
1311,the bedrooms upstairs were tiny but it,ep007
1314,was brand new you wouldn't have to do a,ep007
1317,thing it had that really awesome,ep007
1320,commercial space downstairs it had 12th,ep007
1323,up ceiling good point yeah and it was,ep007
1326,also just 15 minutes from their bar so,ep007
1329,what did you think about that commercial,ep007
1332,property that we saw this interesting,ep007
1335,and unique you're the mountains and a,ep007
1338,huge yard at 399 950 it was the least,ep007
1341,expensive we'd have to put so much money,ep007
1344,into it it's gonna be you know double,ep007
1347,that at the end the whole place is a gut,ep007
1350,check,ep007
1353,it's a giant project it's outside of the,ep007
1356,city so what'd you think about the house,ep007
1359,on the river price 400 thousand makes it,ep007
1362,right in your sweet spot definitely,ep007
1365,unique mperatures the furthest away,ep007
1368,backyard is so awesome bear would love,ep007
1371,that I'd have to do tons of work though,ep007
1374,there's no master bedroom the two,ep007
1377,bedrooms that they do have are really,ep007
1380,really tiny ribbon all the carpet that,ep007
1383,attack feel like you can really make a,ep007
1386,lot of noise seems like we have a pretty,ep007
1389,tough decision I feel that the,ep007
1392,commercial space it was pretty far away,ep007
1395,but maybe within reach although I don't,ep007
1398,want to do a ton of renovation as long,ep007
1401,as we don't have to spend all of our,ep007
1404,time doing it we could just make it the,ep007
1407,way we want it and it has more square,ep007
1410,footage and the I think the yard is,ep007
1413,better for bear too it's got more,ep007
1416,potential sounds like you guys made a,ep007
1419,decision yeah we're gonna do the,ep007
1422,commercial property get the keys,ep007
1425,ten weeks ago we haven't started any,ep007
1428,demo yet but we're waiting on permits,ep007
1431,and about ready to get gone I'm,ep007
1434,surprised you're letting letting me do,ep007
1437,this,ep007
1440,actually let's price was 399 950 and we,ep007
1443,got a seller down to 390 yeah feels good,ep007
1446,great we just started doing some small,ep007
1449,projects or waiting for the demo permit,ep007
1452,we hired an architect and a construction,ep007
1455,team and they're gonna be taking care of,ep007
1458,a lot of the work for us,ep007
1461,okay go get it I think the thing that,ep007
1464,really sold us was the price it was,ep007
1467,still pretty close to work,ep007
1470,I had the yard for bear which is really,ep007
1473,important for me what are we doing you,ep007
1476,know we compromised on that it's not the,ep007
1479,style that we want there's a lot of work,ep007
1482,that needs to be done but a home makes,ep007
1485,it worth it because in the end even,ep007
1488,though we have to wait a little while,ep007
1491,put the money into it you know we're,ep007
1494,gonna end up with the list that we,ep007
1497,really wanted we're gonna completely,ep007
1500,destroy everything so we're gonna take,ep007
1503,out the bathrooms that are here and,ep007
1506,we're gonna add a rooftop patio it's,ep007
1509,gonna connect the two bedrooms upstairs,ep007
1512,which is will be really awesome we'll,ep007
1515,have a big master suite up there that's,ep007
1518,the front door here kitchen it just took,ep007
1521,me a little bit of time for him to be,ep007
1524,able to paint the picture of what he saw,ep007
1527,initial,ep007
1530,it wasn't exactly what we're looking for,ep007
1533,but has the potential to be exactly what,ep007
1536,we want it to be an insane project yeah,ep007
1539,quite quite the project for sure,ep007
12,[Music],ep008
15,that's so pretty out here,ep008
18,Denise and Christy have decided to leave,ep008
21,hectic Southern California for a more,ep008
24,laid-back life in Colorado great view,ep008
27,Pikes Peak and they hope to score an,ep008
30,architectural e interesting house this,ep008
33,is the wow factor I was talking about,ep008
36,the beams they also want lots of land,ep008
39,since denise is a singer and would like,ep008
42,to host outdoor concerts out front could,ep008
45,be the concert venue that will be so,ep008
48,beautiful at night but getting just the,ep008
51,right property may mean taking on a,ep008
54,bigger renovation than they had in mind,ep008
57,this is gonna have to be completely,ep008
60,gutted we have popcorn ceilings up there,ep008
63,this is through the entire house pretty,ep008
66,much that's six thousand square feet of,ep008
69,renovation right off the top,ep008
72,[Music],ep008
75,I get the cutting board I'm Denise I was,ep008
78,a software developer for a little over,ep008
81,20 years go ahead and carry that out to,ep008
84,the table I work for a large healthcare,ep008
87,IT company and I'm a healthcare,ep008
90,executive last year I quit my job and,ep008
93,decided to devote full time to music I'm,ep008
96,a singer/songwriter I perform across the,ep008
99,country,ep008
102,[Music],ep008
105,right now we live with Madeline Denise's,ep008
108,daughter she's 19 years old she's,ep008
111,currently in art school look at how,ep008
114,beautiful they are breathe Denise and I,ep008
117,super career-focused and worked a,ep008
120,bazillion hours a week and when we met,ep008
123,one of the first things Denise told me,ep008
126,was is that she was gonna add color and,ep008
129,texture to my life and the way that I,ep008
132,would say that now is I get to live a,ep008
135,life and even the dorkiest things turn,ep008
138,into a magical adventure it is true,ep008
141,that's exactly how it is for us I guess,ep008
144,with Christy what I love is she kind of,ep008
147,holds everything together for us like,ep008
150,she kind of keeps us on creative fun and,ep008
153,now they're planning one more big,ep008
156,adventure they intend to trade their,ep008
159,hectic lives here in Southern California,ep008
162,for a more laid-back life out of state I,ep008
165,grew up in Southern California and have,ep008
168,spent gosh,ep008
171,50 years living on the 405 freeway and,ep008
174,working probably too much my mom died of,ep008
177,Alzheimer's and so going through that,ep008
180,process with her we learned very quickly,ep008
183,of not putting things off this is our,ep008
186,fiftieth birthday year and this was the,ep008
189,year we're gonna wait for permission to,ep008
192,live the life that we wanted their,ep008
195,destination Colorado Springs the Rockies,ep008
198,are right there the Aspen's are right,ep008
201,there and people take time to be with,ep008
204,each other we spent most of last year,ep008
207,going out there for gigs of hers and we,ep008
210,both fell in love with the community,ep008
213,they're also seeing how people there,ep008
216,responded to Denise's music we found a,ep008
219,community that adopted us and we feel,ep008
222,very blessed Christy can work from there,ep008
225,remotely and Denise will pursue her,ep008
228,music and since the real estate is,ep008
231,"cheaper they hope their $700,000 will",ep008
234,get them a significant upgrade from the,ep008
237,tract home they currently live in what,ep008
240,do you think of this one in Colorado,ep008
243,Springs you can actually find homes,ep008
246,YOUnique we told our real estate agent,ep008
249,you have a really big job in front of,ep008
252,you because we're not willing to settle,ep008
255,this is it this is the last time we're,ep008
258,moving into I personally love,ep008
261,mid-century modern design I love the,ep008
264,idea of walking into someone's home and,ep008
267,you have this big wow factor,ep008
270,so it would be floor-to-ceiling windows,ep008
273,mid-century modern design loves to bring,ep008
276,the outdoor in I am actually looking for,ep008
279,a craftsman 30 something was my favorite,ep008
282,show they had an old craftsman home,ep008
285,where all their friends gathered and,ep008
288,just that whole idea of being a,ep008
291,gathering place that's what's really,ep008
294,attractive to me do you think it's at,ep008
297,"least 3,500 square feet it needs to be",ep008
300,at least twice the size of this house so,ep008
303,we're looking for at a minimum about,ep008
306,"3,500 square feet it's so cute",ep008
309,at least three bedrooms are a must since,ep008
312,the lot room for Madeleine when she,ep008
315,comes to visit a much larger music,ep008
318,studio with a dedicated audio booth is,ep008
321,also key my studio is a 10 by 10 room in,ep008
324,this house and Madeleine now has her,ep008
327,computer and her studio space in there a,ep008
330,large plot of land would also be golden,ep008
333,since she'd like to take the music,ep008
336,outside as well want to be able to host,ep008
339,house concerts so it's some kind of,ep008
342,space outside to be a venue usually we,ep008
345,have the old fashioned now that we're,ep008
348,big whiskey drinkers we're gonna have a,ep008
351,keen eye out for where we could have,ep008
354,that really cool whiskey bar a chef's,ep008
357,kitchen and a deluxe master suite are,ep008
360,also on their list,ep008
363,there's your fixer-upper right there you,ep008
366,know I'm definitely down for a side,ep008
369,renovation that's a big difference,ep008
372,between Denise tonight the amount of,ep008
375,renovation that I'm comfortable with is,ep008
378,probably not more than 25 percent,ep008
381,they've set aside an additional 50 K for,ep008
384,Renault no more if we need to knock down,ep008
387,walls in every single room and rhe,ep008
390,landscape the whole yard and basically,ep008
393,build a whole new house not okay first,ep008
396,up a lodge style house with a lot of,ep008
399,acreage hi guys how are you today it's,ep008
402,so pretty out here yeah I don't like it,ep008
405,that house look at the windows it's got,ep008
408,a craftsman door,ep008
411,it was on about five acres oh and it's,ep008
414,about 2700 square feet so it's a little,ep008
417,small it's a little small three bedrooms,ep008
420,three bathrooms,ep008
423,the price is 625 below your budget so,ep008
426,we've got some room all right here we go,ep008
429,you can see the moss rock fireplace,ep008
432,floor-to-ceiling wood ceiling wood,ep008
435,floors this entire wall is Windows great,ep008
438,view of Pikes Peak it's a little tight,ep008
441,then we're on top of the dining room so,ep008
444,down here we have a big family room area,ep008
447,another fireplace we also have a full,ep008
450,bathroom down here and then a walkout to,ep008
453,a nice patio with Pikes Peak views again,ep008
456,okay I could see myself in the studio in,ep008
459,here you would be fully contained in,ep008
462,here they head to the second floor to,ep008
465,see the other two bedrooms,ep008
468,kind of an oddly shaped room it is,ep008
471,there's two bedrooms and a bathroom in,ep008
474,between and so our vision of the master,ep008
477,suite retreat right right it would have,ep008
480,to be if all of this goes down and this,ep008
483,just becomes an open floor plan if you,ep008
486,do that and we make,ep008
489,[Music],ep008
492,oh my god they see the Jack and Jill,ep008
495,bathroom this whole bathroom layout I,ep008
498,think it's we'd have to be rethought,ep008
501,yeah there's no master suite right to,ep008
504,this at all but there is another bedroom,ep008
507,here it's a little bit bigger because I,ep008
510,could possibly work as the master,ep008
513,bedroom this is a little bit bigger and,ep008
516,it also has another little deck out here,ep008
519,and you get Pikes Peak views from oh,ep008
522,yeah back downstairs they see the,ep008
525,kitchen,ep008
528,it is not a chef's kitchen it's just to,ep008
531,me it's just super small we would,ep008
534,probably want to blow out into this room,ep008
537,let's go look at this face this was,ep008
540,originally supposed to be the dining,ep008
543,room,ep008
546,so it's either I kept the formal dining,ep008
549,room or the big board maker arguing a,ep008
552,kitchen I can't have both off the,ep008
555,kitchen they see a full bath a laundry,ep008
558,room and an office you could possibly be,ep008
561,blown out maybe this could be your,ep008
564,master suite,ep008
567,and you have your own view which is,ep008
570,awesome again and there's plenty of room,ep008
573,out there to build on all right five,ep008
576,acres five acres yeah great,ep008
579,it's pretty private out here so we don't,ep008
582,have that tract home it's right feel,ep008
585,probably have to build some significant,ep008
588,decking right or create some venue space,ep008
591,out here but there's also a view of,ep008
594,Pikes Peak that is the quintessential,ep008
597,Colorado Springs view five acres sounds,ep008
600,fantastic but all five acres aren't,ep008
603,actually usable for us to have a venue,ep008
606,right now in its current state it's not,ep008
609,gonna meet our needs Kristi is very,ep008
612,practical and Denise really is very,ep008
615,visionary but I think the amount of,ep008
618,renovations are talking about a,ep008
621,realistic there's five acres and it's,ep008
624,definitely below our budget but as we,ep008
627,talked about right there's definitely,ep008
630,some significant renovation that we,ep008
633,would need to do that would bring,ep008
636,something over,ep008
639,also the kitchen is super small but the,ep008
642,views are and,ep008
645,stick so now they see a house with much,ep008
648,less renovation but no this isn't really,ep008
651,the kind of neighborhood you're talking,ep008
654,about right sidewalks houses are kind of,ep008
657,closed,ep008
660,[Music],ep008
663,imagine what this looks like in the snow,ep008
666,I know,ep008
669,Christy and Denise are relocating from,ep008
672,Orange County California to Colorado,ep008
675,Springs and are looking for their dream,ep008
678,"house within a budget of $700,000 so far",ep008
681,they've seen a well-priced lodge style,ep008
684,house it had Craftsman features five,ep008
687,acres and a view of Pikes Peak but the,ep008
690,house had only three bedrooms was under,ep008
693,"3,000 square feet and they thought it",ep008
696,would need significant renovations so,ep008
699,now they're seeing a house their agent,ep008
702,thinks is more updated no this isn't,ep008
705,really the kind of neighborhood you're,ep008
708,talking about we're going sidewalks,ep008
711,houses are kind of close stucco that go,ep008
714,but I really want you to keep an open,ep008
717,mind and take a look at the house it's,ep008
720,"listed at 660,000 it is five bedrooms",ep008
723,four bathrooms okay Wow lots of options,ep008
726,it's not really a mid-century modern,ep008
729,house like I'm looking for and certainly,ep008
732,not perhaps a craftsman that Christy is,ep008
735,looking for all right here we go all,ep008
738,right this is nice wow I love the open,ep008
741,floor plan it is just super open it's,ep008
744,wide open,ep008
747,but there's something about this kitchen,ep008
750,that makes it seems like there's a,ep008
753,kitchen inside someone's a lot of people,ep008
756,like that it's great for entertaining,ep008
759,yeah it doesn't have maybe a completely,ep008
762,formal dining room I would want to make,ep008
765,the fireplace you know like,ep008
768,floor-to-ceiling rockwork of Matt is our,ep008
771,track home fireplace at home right the,ep008
774,kitchen's nice and big I love the,ep008
777,stainless steel appliances um I do love,ep008
780,the granite countertops although it is,ep008
783,granite tile instead of slab it's a,ep008
786,little less expensive to do it this way,ep008
789,I think the cabinets are beautiful it's,ep008
792,not really my style but love the wood,ep008
795,and that view is everywhere from this,ep008
798,floor so that's definitely in line with,ep008
801,the wow factor that we're looking for,ep008
804,this kitchen is one of the bigger ones,ep008
807,that we've seen don't think we'd do any,ep008
810,renovating on it right away,ep008
813,but we could do something in the future,ep008
816,to make it just a little bit more my,ep008
819,style and here's a breakfast nook right,ep008
822,here and then flows right into our bar,ep008
825,we could set this up as our whiskey or,ep008
828,wine area all right so I think you're,ep008
831,gonna really like this oh wow this is,ep008
834,spectacular it is look at how glorious,ep008
837,there I'm not sure if it's gonna be big,ep008
840,enough for a venue space we want to have,ep008
843,an outdoor concert right might have to,ep008
846,actually move the fence right the,ep008
849,property goes down,ep008
852,remember it's half acre back inside they,ep008
855,see the master just room great views,ep008
858,again I love that little seating area,ep008
861,there right now we're in master bathroom,ep008
864,oh wow okay well this is a nice big,ep008
867,master bath but you do have a walk-in,ep008
870,closet here oh wow,ep008
873,yes this is the walk-in closet walk-in,ep008
876,closets a-plus we would need to do some,ep008
879,pretty big cosmetic changes the space is,ep008
882,good yeah the space is really good they,ep008
885,head downstairs to look at two bedrooms,ep008
888,and a full bath before seeing the rec,ep008
891,room I love this space I would this is,ep008
894,where I would spend most of my time and,ep008
897,it just feels really nice it's got high,ep008
900,ceilings we've got the view so the only,ep008
903,other concern then is where we're gonna,ep008
906,put the studio space all right well this,ep008
909,is the idea that I have for that okay a,ep008
912,room here that is technically a bedroom,ep008
915,maybe I think the size is right let's,ep008
918,see what's in here oh yeah look at this,ep008
921,I mean this would be a great spot for,ep008
924,like a vocal booth or something just,ep008
927,right there definitely within our price,ep008
930,range,ep008
933,I did a good job on that plenty of room,ep008
936,for a studio maybe not so much room for,ep008
939,an outdoor venue for close proximity we,ep008
942,can see our neighbors so we're really,ep008
945,gonna have to sort of weigh the minimal,ep008
948,renovation yeah against thee it feels a,ep008
951,lot like where we came from but,ep008
954,fantastic yeah really from every room so,ep008
957,now they're headed to a house that won't,ep008
960,be short on character here's our,ep008
963,mid-century modern home Wow,ep008
966,[Music],ep008
969,to taste that this is my favorite the,ep008
972,Kentucky Bourbon yeah whiskey,ep008
975,aficionados Denise and Christie are,ep008
978,following their dream of moving to,ep008
981,Colorado Springs so they're looking for,ep008
984,a house in the area with a budget of,ep008
987,"$700,000 so far they've seen a lodge",ep008
990,style house with the quirky character,ep008
993,they liked but it had no real master,ep008
996,suite then they saw a home that had a,ep008
999,large master and plenty of square,ep008
1002,footage but they felt the house was a,ep008
1005,little short on character and the lot,ep008
1008,was small so now they're heading to,ep008
1011,another option the house we're gonna be,ep008
1014,seeing today is in the mid-century,ep008
1017,modern style perfect five bathrooms four,ep008
1020,bedrooms priced a little above your,ep008
1023,budget at seven hundred and forty,ep008
1026,thousand seven there's three point six,ep008
1029,acres here Wow a mid-century modern,ep008
1032,house in the middle of this rustic area,ep008
1035,in Colorado with all this land I'm not,ep008
1038,sure how we could beat that Wow look at,ep008
1041,the boulders I love how all of the,ep008
1044,outdoor elements are tied to all right,ep008
1047,here we go,ep008
1050,see what you think Wow look at that view,ep008
1053,oh my gosh this is the wow factor I was,ep008
1056,talking look at the beams look at the,ep008
1059,floor I love this original slate this,ep008
1062,would be our dining room and that's our,ep008
1065,living room this is obviously what they,ep008
1068,had used as the dining room you can see,ep008
1071,the chandelier so there's no like formal,ep008
1074,dining room that's its own room no not,ep008
1077,in this home and you could imagine this,ep008
1080,could be our whiskey station that'd be,ep008
1083,fantastic oh we could make this into an,ep008
1086,awesome bar area the floor though this,ep008
1089,is definitely gonna have to go this is,ep008
1092,not authentic to the house the big pain,ep008
1095,point is we have popcorn ceilings up,ep008
1098,there this is through the entire house,ep008
1101,"pretty much which means that's 6,000",ep008
1104,square feet of renovation right off the,ep008
1107,top right and that is just amazing out,ep008
1110,there and this house has about 3400,ep008
1113,square feet of outdoor living space gosh,ep008
1116,imagine an evening cocktail party out,ep008
1119,there,ep008
1122,and then out front could be the concert,ep008
1125,venue that'll be so beautiful at night,ep008
1128,so one of the nice things about being in,ep008
1131,Colorado is that you're going to be able,ep008
1134,to use this space out here six seven,ep008
1137,months of the year I love this view they,ep008
1140,head back inside to see the kitchen this,ep008
1143,is definitely not the commercial grade,ep008
1146,chef's kitchen that we were hoping for,ep008
1149,the countertops are yeah I'm not even,ep008
1152,sure what that is and it is a big,ep008
1155,freaking counter space in addition to,ep008
1158,all that you want commercial grade,ep008
1161,appliances so 25% renovation they take a,ep008
1164,peek at a bedroom that has an attached,ep008
1167,bath another bathroom and a small,ep008
1170,bedroom before seeing the master this is,ep008
1173,not even big enough to be a master but,ep008
1176,what if we took this out mm-hmm and,ep008
1179,combined it with the bedroom all right,ep008
1182,right now we have one big master suite,ep008
1185,we're now talking about a whole lot more,ep008
1188,renovation and we haven't even seen the,ep008
1191,bathroom oh my gosh moly moly carpet on,ep008
1194,the floor yeah that's pretty gross so,ep008
1197,this is gonna have to be completely,ep008
1200,regarded completely it is gonna mean a,ep008
1203,lot of renovation I think for Denise,ep008
1206,that's gonna be an exciting thing and,ep008
1209,for me that is something that I'm gonna,ep008
1212,have to wrap my head around this could,ep008
1215,be a secondary extra living space for,ep008
1218,you definitely a lot of potential in,ep008
1221,here down the hall they see an office I,ep008
1224,love this as the studio this could be,ep008
1227,the control room I love this window and,ep008
1230,in this room here I could see that whole,ep008
1233,area being converted into the vocal,ep008
1236,booth they take a look at a wine cellar,ep008
1239,a guest suite that has a kitchen and,ep008
1242,full bath a bonus room and a library,ep008
1245,before heading outside wow this is so,ep008
1248,pretty,ep008
1251,there's so much room out here I'm glad,ep008
1254,you liked it it's over our list price,ep008
1257,budget and it's over our renovation it,ep008
1260,both time and budget but it has the,ep008
1263,possibility of everything that we want,ep008
1266,to make it our dream home it's,ep008
1269,definitely not in a housing tract no and,ep008
1272,there's room for it to be an outdoor,ep008
1275,venue and it does have that big WOW,ep008
1278,factor that you both really talked about,ep008
1281,I'm stuck on the price it's gonna cost,ep008
1284,right to take what it's got and make it,ep008
1287,our dream home after seeing several,ep008
1290,options it's time for them to decide the,ep008
1293,choice may come down to whether the,ep008
1296,house needs minimal renovation is on,ep008
1299,more than two acres or has a master,ep008
1302,suite we're gonna have to weigh the pros,ep008
1305,and cons gosh the beautiful that is,ep008
1308,Denise and Christy are looking for a,ep008
1311,house in Colorado Springs with a,ep008
1314,"$700,000 budget they've seen several",ep008
1317,options and are ready to decide so what,ep008
1320,do you think of the launch for 625 we've,ep008
1323,got a lot of land five acres but it's,ep008
1326,not 5 acres of usable land right right,ep008
1329,so we have the terrace it or do,ep008
1332,something to have kind of an outdoor,ep008
1335,venue it did have a really good spot or,ep008
1338,the studio where it kind of had its own,ep008
1341,entrance but what'd you think of the,ep008
1344,upstairs master there is no master,ep008
1347,probably have to do 50% renovation in,ep008
1350,that house which is a little bit above,ep008
1353,my 25% rule the contemporary ranch or,ep008
1356,660 I loved how wide open it was on the,ep008
1359,top floor hmm,ep008
1362,but only a half acre lot we'd have the,ep008
1365,terrace set to have an outdoor venue but,ep008
1368,downstairs was fantastic that one,ep008
1371,definitely have the closest kitchen to,ep008
1374,what you wanted yeah it had the least,ep008
1377,amount of renovation weigh less than 25%,ep008
1380,so the mid-century modern for 740 we're,ep008
1383,talking about outdoor concerts but every,ep008
1386,single room needs renovation I would say,ep008
1389,we're probably up to about 80%,ep008
1392,renovation we're gonna put probably,ep008
1395,"close to $200,000 in just",ep008
1398,right now almost gonna be out of million,ep008
1401,dollar home which is why we're leaving,ep008
1404,California as painful as it is for me to,ep008
1407,swallow the mid-century modern has close,ep008
1410,to a million dollars in what we were,ep008
1413,looking for I think that we started this,ep008
1416,journey this year talking about finding,ep008
1419,that perfect dream home,ep008
1422,I think the mid-century modern is it are,ep008
1425,we choosing the mid-century modern we,ep008
1428,are choosing the mid-century modern all,ep008
1431,right I think that's our dream I do not,ep008
1434,think we will regret it for a minute,ep008
1437,[Music],ep008
1440,this would be great for the studio we,ep008
1443,closed escrow two months ago and we are,ep008
1446,getting ready to move out we will be,ep008
1449,here in two months this could be where,ep008
1452,my instruments and all that goes we've,ep008
1455,already started working with some,ep008
1458,designers so hopefully the renovations,ep008
1461,will be in Roz s by the time we gather,ep008
1464,there's a lot of great view out there,ep008
1467,the house was listed for 740 it got it,ep008
1470,down to 705 which we snatched up in a,ep008
1473,heartbeat,ep008
1476,no other house that we've looked at has,ep008
1479,even come close to having the unique wow,ep008
1482,factor that this place does then,ep008
1485,soundbooth they're being able to put in,ep008
1488,a recording studio downstairs and have a,ep008
1491,place for a venue where we could host,ep008
1494,concerts we're just receiver excited,ep008
1497,what are you thinking like in terms of,ep008
1500,where we could set up the band we,ep008
1503,initially planned that we were going to,ep008
1506,do probably 50k renovation wherever we,ep008
1509,landed obviously that's not going to be,ep008
1512,the budget here we're gonna start with a,ep008
1515,budget of 150 K and we think that will,ep008
1518,get us our top three priorities which is,ep008
1521,a master suite the room that we're,ep008
1524,sitting in right now and then Denise's,ep008
1527,studio will be the third priority so we,ep008
1530,could just let that be the stage,ep008
1533,eventually we will turn the kitchen into,ep008
1536,that dream kitchen as well whiskey will,ep008
1539,be poured back there right this really,ep008
1542,is a dream come true this is actually,ep008
1545,our home now,ep008
1548,it still feels surreal we actually own a,ep008
1551,home in Colorado and we're gonna live,ep008
1554,there we're pretty dorky over it,ep008
12,[Music],ep009
15,look at that there are the Smoky,ep009
18,Mountains all the way across that's why,ep009
21,we moved to Tennessee worldtravellers,ep009
24,penny and Tom are ready to put down,ep009
27,roots in Sevierville Tennessee and enjoy,ep009
30,a southern lifestyle but they have,ep009
33,different ideas of what that means my,ep009
36,traditional farmhouse style that I've,ep009
39,been looking for a white cabinet it's,ep009
42,very farmhouse oh lady you could paint,ep009
45,it for me not sure he'd rather have a,ep009
48,rustic mountain cabin instead this is,ep009
51,nice that's a lot of wood okay that's a,ep009
54,cabin and to make things more,ep009
57,complicated he's fixated on what,ep009
60,direction the house faces so we will be,ep009
63,getting our sunset straight out the back,ep009
66,yard which is kind of nice but what to,ep009
69,do if sunsets aren't the only thing,ep009
72,they're seeing from their deck that is,ep009
75,cemetry it is a signature,ep009
78,[Music],ep009
81,welcome welcome welcome are you ready to,ep009
84,try some wine oh yes please all right,ep009
87,I'm Tom I work for a large international,ep009
90,hotel and I penny I work from home for,ep009
93,an airline company and at nighttime I,ep009
96,perform at one of the theatres down at,ep009
99,Pigeon Forge and folks let's try some,ep009
102,local cheese with that oh that would be,ep009
105,generate you like your cheese Naidu,ep009
108,coming from whiskey and I met when we,ep009
111,were working on cruise ships and he was,ep009
114,a singer in this shows I was performing,ep009
117,he was the art director doing the art,ep009
120,auctions one of the things that drew me,ep009
123,and everyone to Penny is her which is,ep009
126,the best for life we have so much fun,ep009
129,together we have very similar,ep009
132,personalities we love to travel having,ep009
135,lived in England and Florida Egypt,ep009
138,Thailand been fortunate to live and,ep009
141,travel all over the place,ep009
144,and most recently the couple was living,ep009
147,in Toms home state of Wisconsin we lived,ep009
150,there for nine years then I got a job,ep009
153,offer here down in Pigeon Forge and so,ep009
156,we decided to pick up and move to,ep009
159,Tennessee y'all and not just any part of,ep009
162,Tennessee they're in a famed tourist,ep009
165,area surrounded by the picturesque Great,ep009
168,Smoky Mountains Great Smoky Mountains,ep009
171,National Park is the most visited,ep009
174,national park in the United States in,ep009
177,fact two-thirds of the United States can,ep009
180,drive here in less than a day making it,ep009
183,a great destination and it's a wonderful,ep009
186,area there's lots going on here all,ep009
189,sorts of different restaurants,ep009
192,activities lots of things to do here and,ep009
195,it's just a beautiful part of the,ep009
198,country that little barbecue place that,ep009
201,funky small one remember we went there,ep009
204,she's so small couldn't even stand,ep009
207,inside me when we first moved to the,ep009
210,area we weren't sure whether we wanted,ep009
213,to stay here or not now that we've,ep009
216,fallen in love we decided to purchase a,ep009
219,home and put down some roots ready to,ep009
222,get out of their rental they're focusing,ep009
225,the house hunt in the town of,ep009
228,Sevierville 15 minutes from Pigeon Forge,ep009
231,our budget for this home is 250 thousand,ep009
234,two hundred certainly two hundred and,ep009
237,fifty thousand able to find something,ep009
240,that is gonna suit our needs for the,ep009
243,right place we can go up to 250 but just,ep009
246,on cautious side I kind of want to stay,ep009
249,around the 200,ep009
252,because we enjoy doing the touristy,ep009
255,thing every week and it's just nice,ep009
258,having that extra money in your pocket,ep009
261,at each month,ep009
264,what sheepies fish &amp; chips when I was,ep009
267,growing up in Ingram we always stayed,ep009
270,and lived in traditional style houses a,ep009
273,two-level house so that's sort of more,ep009
276,what I'm looking for and she would also,ep009
279,like the home to have a country or,ep009
282,farmhouse sort of feel but Tom prefers a,ep009
285,different rustic vibe I've been,ep009
288,interested in the cabin style of home is,ep009
291,something befitting the area a nice,ep009
294,balcony overlooking the Smoky Mountains,ep009
297,is a must and Tom wants privacy to enjoy,ep009
300,those views so he prefers some distance,ep009
303,from the neighbors but penny doesn't,ep009
306,mind the community feel,ep009
309,then there's the inside of the house to,ep009
312,consider I love carpet throughout the,ep009
315,house it just feels warmer and again,ep009
318,it's maybe something from my childhood,ep009
321,we always grow up in the house with,ep009
324,carpet and so that's just what I love,ep009
327,and what I know he on the other hand I,ep009
330,like hardwood you know I do the kitchen,ep009
333,yeah hardwoods easy to clean talking to,ep009
336,the kitchen I like white cabinets and I,ep009
339,just think they look really really smart,ep009
342,and really really classy,ep009
345,I like black appliances is the black and,ep009
348,white thing I just think it makes it the,ep009
351,kitchen looks sharp but he really likes,ep009
354,the look of stainless steel appliances,ep009
357,and dark cabinets instead I like dark,ep009
360,wood so even if we can't find that,ep009
363,perfect cabin I'll still have the feel,ep009
366,of that a fireplace is also something,ep009
369,that's very important to they agree on,ep009
372,the need for a two-car attached garage,ep009
375,and a home office for Penny,ep009
378,but while she'd like to have a spa tub,ep009
381,for relaxing he's got a specific,ep009
384,requirement for the backyard we can get,ep009
387,the backyard facing west,ep009
390,we'll have that Sun all afternoon and,ep009
393,into the evening we can enjoy barbecuing,ep009
396,entertaining sitting outside and then,ep009
399,there are two other members of the,ep009
402,family to consider Rufus and Sergeant,ep009
405,Pepper they are my babies,ep009
408,I need to keep them safe in a fenced,ep009
411,yard so that is the most important thing,ep009
414,for me that we have a fenced back yard,ep009
417,where they can play come on pack when we,ep009
420,packed up and came to Tennessee we,ep009
423,talked about just renting and just keep,ep009
426,traveling but we just fell in love with,ep009
429,this area,ep009
432,and so it just it's gonna be nice to,ep009
435,unpack and put down roots for a few more,ep009
438,years before we travel on again he'll be,ep009
441,exciting can't wait to get started first,ep009
444,up is a newly built traditional house in,ep009
447,a subdivision not quite the mountain,ep009
450,retreat tom was wanting one of the,ep009
453,things that gives me great pause is that,ep009
456,the neighbors are so close I like to,ep009
459,have neighbors it's what I grew up with,ep009
462,back in England I like this this is like,ep009
465,my traditional farmhouse style that I've,ep009
468,been looking for I'm exactly the cabin,ep009
471,that we talked about but I gotta tell,ep009
474,you I liked it it's got the attached,ep009
477,garage I think you guys are really gonna,ep009
480,like this one it's a three-bedroom,ep009
483,"two-and-a-half-bath roughly 2,200 square",ep009
486,feet and it's listed at a hundred and,ep009
489,ninety five thousand dollars oh this is,ep009
492,nice I love this hardwood this is nice,ep009
495,and sister right color I wish they do,ep009
498,have carpet on the stairs though which,ep009
501,is got a fireplace windows nice low,ep009
504,window sills room in here and check out,ep009
507,the dark wood cabinets just what I was,ep009
510,hoping for it,ep009
513,I think penny might be a little too,ep009
516,picky in the kitchen stainless is easier,ep009
519,to find it's easier to clean and I like,ep009
522,them better penny and Tom as you get to,ep009
525,know him you'll see there's there's,ep009
528,differences in what they want and,ep009
531,they're not afraid to let you know how,ep009
534,they feel about it look at these,ep009
537,neighbors they're right on top of us Tom,ep009
540,there is cypresses and those things grow,ep009
543,three to five feet a year so that'll,ep009
546,give you plenty of the prophecy from,ep009
549,side to side,ep009
552,by the time I'm your age I won't be able,ep009
555,to see the name that's Bonnie yes sir I,ep009
558,like that at least we have got the,ep009
561,fenced yard which is great for the dogs,ep009
564,one thing I wanted to check was the,ep009
567,direction I've got a little compass here,ep009
570,let's check it out so we will be getting,ep009
573,our sunset straight out the backyard,ep009
576,which is kind of nice we'll have Sun in,ep009
579,the afternoon oh that's good but I don't,ep009
582,know no mountain view and the neighbors,ep009
585,right on top of us here that's a lot to,ep009
588,consider,ep009
591,they head upstairs to see the master,ep009
594,suite oh this is nice,ep009
597,daddy's got my car yeah plenty room for,ep009
600,a king-size bed yeah let's check out the,ep009
603,master bath okay check it top right here,ep009
606,oh yeah that was a definite must on my,ep009
609,wish list gotta say I'm not crazy about,ep009
612,these fixtures but if we wanted to make,ep009
615,a change like that that'd be pretty easy,ep009
618,to do,ep009
621,absolutely down the hall they look in on,ep009
624,a guest room and bath before making,ep009
627,their way to Penny's potential office,ep009
630,space I could see my corner desk here we,ep009
633,ought to look over the dogs playing in,ep009
636,the backyard huh,ep009
639,Tom I can see the mountains from here,ep009
642,yeah sure the last room to see is a,ep009
645,bonus room oh wow Wow oh this is great,ep009
648,so I could watch my football games and,ep009
651,you could watch your football games,ep009
654,right it's that traditional type of home,ep009
657,that I've been looking for almost like a,ep009
660,farmhouse look I did that I really like,ep009
663,that I mean this is way where I want to,ep009
666,be on my budget so it's a place of great,ep009
669,price isn't it it's nice it's not the,ep009
672,cabin style that I was hoping for but I,ep009
675,really good like it's got that nice dark,ep009
678,hardwood that I want white cabinets with,ep009
681,the black appliances I know you do but,ep009
684,the neighbors are right next to us,ep009
687,it's west-facing yeah that was a big,ep009
690,thing that was a big thing,ep009
693,you're just not much privacy I know how,ep009
696,I want privacy and this house really,ep009
699,doesn't have it so their agent takes,ep009
702,them to see something that has more of,ep009
705,that secluded mountain feel Tom's,ep009
708,looking for as looks great looks like,ep009
711,Tennessee,ep009
714,[Music],ep009
717,did you see the snowfall penny and Tom,ep009
720,recently moved to the Smoky Mountain,ep009
723,area of Tennessee and they're looking,ep009
726,for a house with a 250 thousand dollar,ep009
729,max budget so far they've seen a,ep009
732,traditional two-story house her,ep009
735,preferred style and although it was,ep009
738,below budget and had an attached two-car,ep009
741,garage it wasn't his cabin with,ep009
744,sprawling mountain views so today,ep009
747,they're seeing a house that is more of,ep009
750,what Tom had in mind looks great looks,ep009
753,like Tennessee nice job that's the cabin,ep009
756,all right this is kind of a rustic,ep009
759,property which isn't really what I was,ep009
762,looking for it's okay if I was just,ep009
765,gonna vacation there for a week or two,ep009
768,but I don't want to be living here fifty,ep009
771,two weeks of the year and where's my,ep009
774,garage Randy there is not a garage with,ep009
777,this foot there isn't all that could be,ep009
780,a deal-breaker I understand yeah this is,ep009
783,a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath and,ep009
786,the list price is 225 thousand let's,ep009
789,check it out oh wow Kevin's gonna have a,ep009
792,lot of wood yeah like a little darker,ep009
795,wood but still this is nice I love the,ep009
798,fireplace right there walk right in nice,ep009
801,warm feel in here this floors don't lick,ep009
804,the floors,ep009
807,although I am a carpet person I I do,ep009
810,like these wood floors I like how it,ep009
813,flows into the kitchen here mm-hmm well,ep009
816,the kitchen's not too big but just the,ep009
819,two of us I don't like the white,ep009
822,appliances though you know how to like,ep009
825,my black appliances I know but it's so,ep009
828,far under budget we would have plenty of,ep009
831,money to get new appliances redo the,ep009
834,countertops cabinets get those white,ep009
837,cabinets you like under your budget,ep009
840,my budget is off the kitchen they head,ep009
843,down a hallway to take a look at the,ep009
846,master suite guys this is a decent size,ep009
849,actually well I like that it's got,ep009
852,carpet I'm not really a big fan of this,ep009
855,carpet I do like the fact that there's,ep009
858,an ensuite oh my gosh Tom look at the,ep009
861,size of this tub that's nice nice a,ep009
864,shower and I says tub is a great sized,ep009
867,bath sir yeah this is actually a pretty,ep009
870,nice ensuite mm-hmm,ep009
873,[Music],ep009
876,there are the Smoky Mountains all the,ep009
879,way across that's why we moved to,ep009
882,Tennessee yeah but no fenced yard,ep009
885,there is no fenced-in yard well we can,ep009
888,buy a fence what would we put it down,ep009
891,there the grass stay an area down below,ep009
894,that was it west facing I think it is,ep009
897,yep right there due west so you've got,ep009
900,your afternoon sunsets just gonna be,ep009
903,beautiful this is great,ep009
906,back inside they head downstairs to the,ep009
909,lower level this is cool it is actually,ep009
912,I would always cut that nasty old carpet,ep009
915,down here an easy fix,ep009
918,easy fix pool table yes sir with the,ep009
921,listing process of 225 this home comes,ep009
924,completely furnished as well as with the,ep009
927,pool table really Oh little man cave,ep009
930,down here okay down the hall they look,ep009
933,in on a guest bath and two guest rooms I,ep009
936,definitely use this as my office I can,ep009
939,see that yeah,ep009
942,well first of all I love the fact that,ep009
945,it's a cabin it really looks like,ep009
948,Tennessee fireplace there's a lot going,ep009
951,on upstairs but there was no garage you,ep009
954,know we said we wanted a garage yeah I,ep009
957,know and then there was just so much,ep009
960,wood in this place well it's a cabin,ep009
963,you're gonna get a lot of wood and I'll,ep009
966,tell you what that view is awesome it's,ep009
969,what we talked about when we talked,ep009
972,about moving to Tennessee finding a,ep009
975,place that has that spectacular mountain,ep009
978,view but no fenced yard the dogs won't,ep009
981,have anywhere to go,ep009
984,that's an easy fix that's a phone call,ep009
987,we get someone to come and put a fence,ep009
990,in piece of cake that said know that I,ep009
993,did cost to the carpet to the appliances,ep009
996,now the fence is just gonna spiral out,ep009
999,of control and it's already over my,ep009
1002,budget,ep009
1005,well it's underneath mine so I think,ep009
1008,there's there's some wiggle room this is,ep009
1011,definitely one to consider since Penny's,ep009
1014,not convinced they head out to look at a,ep009
1017,home that offers a different type of,ep009
1020,view how mu doin,ep009
1023,[Music],ep009
1026,this couple is shopping for a home in,ep009
1029,Sevierville Tennessee with their,ep009
1032,"$250,000 max budget so far they've seen",ep009
1035,a well-priced traditional style home,ep009
1038,perfect for penny,ep009
1041,even though it had a fenced yard for the,ep009
1044,dogs Tom thought the neighbors were too,ep009
1047,close and it lacked privacy then they,ep009
1050,saw a cabin in a more remote setting,ep009
1053,with one-of-a-kind views for two hundred,ep009
1056,and twenty five thousand while he loved,ep009
1059,the rustic retreat she thought it was,ep009
1062,too much his style and not enough hers,ep009
1065,today they're looking at another option,ep009
1068,that has their attached garage and the,ep009
1071,farmhouse feel for penny how mu doin,ep009
1074,farmhouse style like it's on a farm I,ep009
1077,grew up in Wisconsin I like cows however,ep009
1080,to have a daily menagerie of the sights,ep009
1083,the smells the sounds of a working farm,ep009
1086,that's something that starts early in,ep009
1089,the day and just wouldn't stop I think,ep009
1092,it's pretty pretty and I could just see,ep009
1095,myself on the mornings just sitting,ep009
1098,there with a cup of coffee having a look,ep009
1101,at the farm animals out there and it's,ep009
1104,listed for two hundred and five thousand,ep009
1107,dollars two hundred five oh that's good,ep009
1110,I wish we had carpet on the floors what,ep009
1113,is on the floor is it laminate or real,ep009
1116,these are hardwood floor the hardwood,ep009
1119,floors okay you're soon where's the,ep009
1122,fireplace no fireplace in this one Tom,ep009
1125,that's an important thing you know I,ep009
1128,love the fireplace yeah but you know,ep009
1131,what I still think this is a really nice,ep009
1134,room step on through we'll check out the,ep009
1137,kitchen,ep009
1140,okay oh and my black appliances Thank,ep009
1143,You Randy yes ma'am I'm not a keen on,ep009
1146,the color of the cabinets I would like,ep009
1149,my white cabinets well this kind of goes,ep009
1152,with that farmhouse theme here I suppose,ep009
1155,but even the white cabinet it's very,ep009
1158,farmhouse so maybe you could paint it,ep009
1161,for me no chance,ep009
1164,[Music],ep009
1167,it's not a cemetry it is a signature so,ep009
1170,we have cows and a cemetry in our,ep009
1173,backyard,ep009
1176,well we would have to build a fence on,ep009
1179,this small little patch there's really,ep009
1182,not a lot of room for the dogs at all,ep009
1185,they're the Sun this looks like it could,ep009
1188,be north let me see here north by,ep009
1191,northeast so that means in the yard you,ep009
1194,wouldn't be getting any afternoon Sun or,ep009
1197,any Sun sets over the graveyard that's,ep009
1200,great yeah all right back inside they,ep009
1203,head to the main floor master suite I,ep009
1206,love the fact that is carpet on the,ep009
1209,floor love that and I think king bed,ep009
1212,would actually work in here it's a good,ep009
1215,size yeah there's plenty of room for,ep009
1218,that all right let's go look at the,ep009
1221,master bathroom here okay all right,ep009
1224,that's nice thanks good sighs looks like,ep009
1227,we got a bath there mm-hmm oh that's the,ep009
1230,loo the loo okay around the corner yeah,ep009
1233,they head upstairs to see a guest bath,ep009
1236,and two guest rooms one of which could,ep009
1239,work for Penny's home office the high,ep009
1242,ceilings over here kind of funky slant,ep009
1245,there's over there but good window yeah,ep009
1248,well I gotta say the cub appeal was,ep009
1251,beautiful I love their two-car garage,ep009
1254,there that's the real room a real,ep009
1257,farmhouse appeals that I really like the,ep009
1260,porch the covered porch overlooking the,ep009
1263,cows the cows is there something I,ep009
1266,believe say this but I really like the,ep009
1269,hardwood floors in the living room it,ep009
1272,really suits that farmhouse feel but,ep009
1275,where's the fireplace it's missing a,ep009
1278,fireplace and that's a big drawback that,ep009
1281,kitchen I look everything about it the,ep009
1284,only thing I didn't was those cabinet,ep009
1287,colors I really want my white cabinets,ep009
1290,that backyard was very very small and it,ep009
1293,faces north so you're not going to get,ep009
1296,Sun in the afternoon and certainly no,ep009
1299,sunsets,ep009
1302,there's the cows and then as cemeteries,ep009
1305,having a cemetery it means that your,ep009
1308,neighbor isn't gonna be quiet right can,ep009
1311,only hope and since all the homes are,ep009
1314,priced below their max budget they'll,ep009
1317,choose what's most important a garage a,ep009
1320,fireplace or those mountain views I love,ep009
1323,that view I'm gonna go with your famous,ep009
1326,lemon blueberry escape awesome that's a,ep009
1329,good choice penny and Tom are also,ep009
1332,hoping to make a good choice when it,ep009
1335,comes to buying their new home in,ep009
1338,Sevierville Tennessee they've seen their,ep009
1341,options now it's time to decide what,ep009
1344,about that new build traditional for 195,ep009
1347,that two-car garage I that's something,ep009
1350,we both really wanted and the curb,ep009
1353,appeal was absolutely stunning love the,ep009
1356,dark hardwood let's not forget the,ep009
1359,fireplace the stainless appliances yeah,ep009
1362,but I wanted black the cabinets were,ep009
1365,beautiful but the wrong color,ep009
1368,I would prefer white the backyard there,ep009
1371,was plenty of space out there I think,ep009
1374,that would be the dogs favorite we were,ep009
1377,the house faced to work right it faced,ep009
1380,West yes so we would get afternoon Sun,ep009
1383,we would get the sunsets,ep009
1386,but cookie-cutter house is right on top,ep009
1389,of each other also with the view not,ep009
1392,your traditional you know jaw-dropper of,ep009
1395,a view what did you think of the cabin,ep009
1398,"at 225,000 that cabin really looked like",ep009
1401,Tennessee to me what about the dogs,ep009
1404,there's no,ep009
1407,for them to play well there was an area,ep009
1410,out there that was clear put up a fence,ep009
1413,there's plenty of room I love the,ep009
1416,fireplace,ep009
1419,oh the fireplace was really nice really,ep009
1422,beautiful problem that I had though,ep009
1425,there was so much wood,ep009
1428,yeah well it's a cabin I did not like,ep009
1431,the appliances at all those white,ep009
1434,appliances but it's the view it faces,ep009
1437,West that was beautiful sunsets over the,ep009
1440,Great Smoky Mountains every single day,ep009
1443,that's the view we pictured when we were,ep009
1446,thinking about moving here what do you,ep009
1449,think of the palm house for two hundred,ep009
1452,and five thousand it did really have a,ep009
1455,great look it was a really warm field,ep009
1458,but there's no fireplace that so-called,ep009
1461,backyard yeah,ep009
1464,faced north and there's a cemetery it's,ep009
1467,a little creepy I've got to say they,ep009
1470,loved the fact that it did have a,ep009
1473,two-car garage that's something that I,ep009
1476,really really wanted I really really,ep009
1479,like that kitchen and I loved the fact,ep009
1482,that it had the black appliances,ep009
1485,all-in-all I really liked that farmhouse,ep009
1488,[Music],ep009
1491,you know I'm leaning toward the cabin I,ep009
1494,love that view I know but I'm really,ep009
1497,leaning towards that traditional new,ep009
1500,build I mean it's got the fenced-in yard,ep009
1503,we've got the two-car garage there and,ep009
1506,"it's $50,000 under your budget",ep009
1509,55 oh yeah should we get that one shall,ep009
1512,we let's do it,ep009
1515,all right go Randy it's good if I sit to,ep009
1518,pick,ep009
1521,we put in an offer on the house about,ep009
1524,two months ago and we moved in three,ep009
1527,weeks ago there you go,ep009
1530,we chose this house because it was way,ep009
1533,way way under Tom's budget and right on,ep009
1536,point with mine,ep009
1539,Doug's loved the house I think it's,ep009
1542,definitely full paws-up can't you see,ep009
1545,how important that west-facing backyard,ep009
1548,is now I would never have thought about,ep009
1551,it but this is perfect just feel the,ep009
1554,difference I mean it's just is what is,ep009
1557,it 3 o'clock in the afternoon and it's,ep009
1560,just beaming down and it's just gorgeous,ep009
1563,this probably isn't gonna be the last,ep009
1566,house we ever live in so my,ep009
1569,opportunities for a magnificent view are,ep009
1572,in the future but the money we saved by,ep009
1575,selecting this house means I've got,ep009
1578,money for a pass to the national park,ep009
1581,and I can go there and look at the view,ep009
1584,anytime I want I think I saw the chopper,ep009
1587,thing down here that's what happens when,ep009
1590,you're in a new house oh we go that's it,ep009
1593,there you go,ep009
1596,Thanks I originally wanted white,ep009
1599,cabinets but I've got to say with the,ep009
1602,decor of this house the dark cabinets,ep009
1605,does flow and I'm really warming up to,ep009
1608,those dark cabinets it's got really nice,ep009
1611,appliances they may not be black but,ep009
1614,they're great they're new and it's just,ep009
1617,a really nice space oh it's gonna be,ep009
1620,great living here but for now I think,ep009
1623,this is the perfect place to rest our,ep009
1626,heads,ep009
1629,[Music],ep009
12,Wow Wow I love the ceiling Melissa and,ep010
15,fiance Brian are on the hunt for their,ep010
18,first place together in Miami Florida,ep010
21,they want a modern space this is really,ep010
24,pretty,ep010
27,"oh yeah love it but even with a $900,000",ep010
30,budget there will still be compromises,ep010
33,Wow,ep010
36,and I mean whoa as in small I am seeing,ep010
39,the neighbor yeah,ep010
42,and I'm seeing right into their bathroom,ep010
45,can they find a house that works for,ep010
48,both of them do you feel boxed in at all,ep010
51,out here I mean,ep010
54,[Music],ep010

78,previous marriage my oldest is Charlize,ep010
81,and she's 14 and the youngest is Holland,ep010
84,and she's 12 Ben yeah we actually met,ep010
87,when we were about 13 years old,ep010
90,we were both competitive springboard,ep010
93,platform divers here in South Florida,ep010
96,and we were reintroduced by a mutual,ep010
99,friend of ours two years ago on our,ep010
102,first date she confessed to me that she,ep010
105,had a huge crush on me when we were kids,ep010
108,it's kind of weird I have to say he was,ep010
111,such a big deal back then I still kind,ep010
114,of say oh my gosh look I'm I'm now,ep010
117,engaged to Brian the sprinkler platform,ep010
120,stud I love Miami so it's exciting to be,ep010
123,back there's so many things to do we are,ep010
126,very outdoorsy people and we love to run,ep010
129,and go on boats and just all the things,ep010
132,that you can do outside we like to go to,ep010
135,the beach a lot the access to the water,ep010
138,is here trade and now that she's back,ep010
141,they're ready to buy their first place,ep010
144,together in the Miami area both coming,ep010
147,from condo living,ep010
150,they've got their sights set on,ep010
153,single-family houses but are open to,ep010
156,townhomes if they provide enough space,ep010
159,we want four bedrooms separate bedrooms,ep010
162,for the girls yes that would be nice,ep010
165,I work from home primarily if I'm not,ep010
168,traveling so an office space is,ep010
171,definitely a top the list as well so why,ep010
174,don't we put in what we're looking for,ep010
177,criteria and don't forget the budget Oh,ep010
180,imagine such a dynamic although approved,ep010
183,for more they'd like to stick to,ep010
186,"$900,000 I think that's a pretty good",ep010
189,starting point to find you know most of,ep010
192,the must-haves that we have on our list,ep010
195,I love modern designs simple materials,ep010
198,natural materials clean lines neutral,ep010
201,color palette I love white so,ep010
204,specifically I love bit century modern,ep010
207,it's a popular architectural style he,ep010
210,grew up around in Miami but inside the,ep010
213,home they agree they want an updated,ep010
216,contemporary design which includes an,ep010
219,open floor plan and a large high-end,ep010
222,kitchen I left a cook and top priority,ep010
225,for me would be a barbecue area that's,ep010
228,one of the things that I've missed,ep010
231,dearly living in a condo but what's a,ep010
234,burger who wants a dog bring to the,ep010
237,table other outside wishes include a,ep010
240,pool and clean cut landscaping I don't,ep010
243,like the overgrown jungle II foliage,ep010
246,that you tend to find in Miami I know it,ep010
249,lives in there and I'm not a big fan of,ep010
252,snakes and rats and all sorts of,ep010
255,critters and I hate that as well oh wow,ep010
258,that's a fixer-upper,ep010
261,I'm not handy at all I really do not,ep010
264,want to fix her up her it would be a lot,ep010
267,of fun for me to have a fixer-upper,ep010
270,but he doesn't have the patience level,ep010
273,nor do we have the time but that being,ep010
276,said we can move into something and I,ep010
279,could still have a couple projects and,ep010
282,the one project they're both hoping for,ep010
285,is converting a two-car garage to a,ep010
288,media room for the kids an area for them,ep010
291,to have kids over socialize so we can,ep010
294,keep an eye on them pretty much I love,ep010
297,the thought of building an entire media,ep010
300,room for the girls he will not be,ep010
303,involved first up a mid-century modern,ep010
306,home built in 1947 so I'm very excited,ep010
309,about this house guys this is a,ep010
312,four-bedroom three-bath and it's only,ep010
315,eight hundred and seventy nine thousand,ep010
318,oh I like that what do you think from,ep010
321,the outside it's a little less my style,ep010
324,probably more his style I like it I like,ep010
327,the porch the roof,ep010
330,you know it's Mediterranean definitely,ep010
333,not what we were looking for but at,ep010
336,least the whole house doesn't look,ep010
339,Mediterranean I thought the landscaping,ep010
342,is a little janky a little wild I mean,ep010
345,honey look at this I mean god only knows,ep010
348,what's living in that Bush is that a,ep010
351,bush or a tree once you go check not,ep010
354,what I was expecting at all it's much,ep010
357,more contemporary than I thought from,ep010
360,the outside it's just a formal living,ep010
363,room okay I love the ceiling and I love,ep010
366,of the whole white vibe it's totally,ep010
369,what I was looking for perfect so let's,ep010
372,look and see one of the bedrooms this is,ep010
375,a nice-sized bedroom for one of the,ep010
378,girls it is and you have a bathroom in,ep010
381,there SWAT reforms really great setup so,ep010
384,let's go checking the master bedroom,ep010
387,master would be a stretch I mean the,ep010
390,other bedroom was bigger it was a little,ep010
393,bigger yes okay interesting,ep010
396,walk into the master bathroom please,ep010
399,okay well this is nice it's clean it,ep010
402,looks updated the blue is definitely not,ep010
405,my style but I do enjoy the white and,ep010
408,Brian can always paint so I hear you are,ep010
411,very handy Yeah right,ep010
414,my guy is oh this is making me happy,ep010
417,right now Vanessa very glad like a big,ep010
420,closet it is well this is actually a,ep010
423,bedroom and they converted into a huge,ep010
426,master closet so we are losing a bedroom,ep010
429,and adding a closet yes you are yeah,ep010
432,what about an office space I mean four,ep010
435,bedroom was three that's true but we,ep010
438,haven't seen the rest of the house yet,ep010
441,off the living room is a dining space it,ep010
444,feels a little closed in so it's,ep010
447,interesting that there is kind of like a,ep010
450,separate kitchen connected to what would,ep010
453,be the kitchen,ep010
456,hmm whoa and I mean whoa Evan small it,ep010
459,is a little small um wanted more of an,ep010
462,open floor plan concept education we've,ep010
465,got to take down the wall remove that,ep010
468,other weird disjointed kitchen out of,ep010
471,the dining room and this space lots of,ep010
474,work for us we're already at the top of,ep010
477,our budget I know the way that she likes,ep010
480,to do kitchens it's the right way,ep010
483,they're expensive definitely not looking,ep010
486,"to spend $150,000 of reconfiguring maybe",ep010
489,there's a couple things that we could do,ep010
492,in the short term there's another,ep010
495,bedroom suite off the kitchen Wow it's a,ep010
498,walk-in closet or a third bedroom no,ep010
501,this is your third bedroom well we're,ep010
504,gonna have a problem with this one yeah,ep010
507,this is tiny on the other side of the,ep010
510,dining room,ep010
513,family room nice then you also have an,ep010
516,office or a bedroom since the other,ep010
519,bedroom was small this is much much,ep010
522,bigger but there's no closet and no,ep010
525,bathroom mm-hmm maybe just one more,ep010
528,thing item into the renovation budget,ep010
531,you ever inflated renovation budget,ep010
534,there's also a two-car garage nice face,ep010
537,yeah I could do a lot with this there's,ep010
540,a lot of options as far as its immediate,ep010
543,room okay now let's go and see that back,ep010
546,you're on the beautiful pool you're out,ep010
549,there kitchen as well right this is,ep010
552,great honey your domain real I'm back,ep010
555,order out I can see you here honey,ep010
558,yes but the girls in the pool although,ep010
561,the pool is a little small Vanessa it's,ep010
564,a newer pool Danny it's a heated pool,ep010
567,too,ep010
570,[Music],ep010
573,style the house I think fits you know,ep010
576,mid-century modern my taste it's more,ep010
579,modern inside than you thought it would,ep010
582,be,ep010
585,mm-hmm and that works for me I love all,ep010
588,the white walls but there are some,ep010
591,logistical issues with the house but I'm,ep010
594,a little concerned about the bedrooms,ep010
597,okay the sizes and I'd really want to,ep010
600,renovate the kitchen there's no half,ep010
603,bath a powder room for any guest,ep010
606,anybody that has to go to the bathroom,ep010
609,has to use one of ours in our bedrooms,ep010
612,that's true unless we did that in the,ep010
615,media room which then doesn't work in,ep010
618,our budget that's exactly your catch,ep010
621,so their agents found a house with a,ep010
624,different layout they may like more it's,ep010
627,been completely completely remodeled,ep010
630,from the Melissa and fiance Brian met 30,ep010
633,years ago when they were competitive,ep010
636,divers in Miami he in particular still,ep010
639,loves the sport impressive diving skill,ep010
642,still and he will not hesitate to show,ep010
645,you those if you put him near any body,ep010
648,of water I'm a competitive show-off on,ep010
651,the hunt for their first place together,ep010
654,in the Miami area they've already seen a,ep010
657,mid-century modern that was below their,ep010
660,"$900,000 budget it had a pool and",ep010
663,barbecue area they liked but it also had,ep010
666,a lot of projects so today their agents,ep010
669,found a place that's been recently,ep010
672,renovated this is a townhouse it's,ep010
675,"almost it's a little over 2,600 square",ep010
678,feet it's a four bedroom two and a half,ep010
681,baths and the asking price is 1.1 whoa,ep010
684,oh that's I know it would have to dazzle,ep010
687,us okay well one I hope it does it's,ep010
690,been completely completely remodeled,ep010
693,from the guts up and they use a lot of,ep010
696,high-end finishes as well so Melissa and,ep010
699,I are approved up to a million maybe a,ep010
702,little bit more but we definitely don't,ep010
705,want to spend that much second trip up,ep010
708,communities for you to have your,ep010
711,community pool and we're on the water as,ep010
714,well so there's some arena it's not,ep010
717,visible from the house but it's here in,ep010
720,the same community okay so that's,ep010
723,something to take into consideration,ep010
726,girls so not a corner townhouse that,ep010
729,there's no other townhouses next to you,ep010
732,so you're more private,ep010
735,as far as mid-century modern house we,ep010
738,can't do anything to the exterior but,ep010
741,then there's also no me,ep010
744,either so that's great yeah it does make,ep010
747,it easy great right so let's look at it,ep010
750,inside okay what do you think very,ep010
753,pretty that's well done this is your,ep010
756,living room I like the open floor plan I,ep010
759,do love the color palette I love the,ep010
762,gray and modern like you it's clean,ep010
765,modern girl and I do love how it's,ep010
768,connected to patio I mean this is,ep010
771,actually a nice space but it would be,ep010
774,nice to set up tables chairs a barbecue,ep010
777,grill and do you feel boxed in at all,ep010
780,out here,ep010
783,well I mean it's a townhouse I mean so I,ep010
786,like the dining room how its laid out,ep010
789,yes you could do formal or casual that,ep010
792,works for us well and I love the island,ep010
795,and to be able ability to sit and do,ep010
798,breakfast here kitchens well done I mean,ep010
801,it's beautiful,ep010
804,I love the countertops clean simple it's,ep010
807,a nicely done kitchen absolutely I know,ep010
810,we're here we have a two-car garage,ep010
813,let's look at it it's a nice sized,ep010
816,garage and again at 1.1 which is way,ep010
819,over our budget to actually out of room,ep010
822,right significant I would like to be,ep010
825,able to put some money into to make it,ep010
828,really great for the girls okay,ep010
831,back inside they see a first-floor half,ep010
834,bath on the way to the second floor you,ep010
837,have three bedrooms here okay there's,ep010
840,also a full bath at the end of the hall,ep010
843,is the master suite,ep010
846,this is the master bathroom yeah your,ep010
849,bathtub separate from your rain shower,ep010
852,over there I love this you know so this,ep010
855,is great awesome great so let's go check,ep010
858,your master closet okay so one big,ep010
861,beautiful master closet yeah nice so,ep010
864,let's check out that room oh great great,ep010
867,size I do love the master suite it's a,ep010
870,nice livable space up there,ep010
873,[Music],ep010
876,there's so many things that I like about,ep010
879,it and that we're on our list I love the,ep010
882,color palette everything's done yeah the,ep010
885,open floor plan downstairs the kitchen I,ep010
888,mean they nails but the yard space is,ep010
891,small with no private pool and the home,ep010
894,is over their budget 1.1 million that's,ep010
897,expensive you know in addition to having,ep010
900,to convert the garage into a media room,ep010
903,so their agents found a single-family,ep010
906,house for them to see that's more,ep010
909,affordable the asking price is eight,ep010
912,hundred and seventy seven thousand,ep010
915,[Music],ep010
918,I love this store Melissa and fiance,ep010
921,Brian are getting ready to buy their,ep010
924,first place together with a budget of,ep010
927,"$900,000 they've been searching for a",ep010
930,4-bedroom place in the Miami area so far,ep010
933,they've seen a well-priced single-family,ep010
936,home that had a lot of projects and a,ep010
939,spendy townhouse that was newly,ep010
942,renovated so today their agent vanessa,ep010
945,has another option to show them a new,ep010
948,construction property she hopes they'll,ep010
951,like so we're on a brand new development,ep010
954,there's 18 single-family homes here,ep010
957,under still 6 on the market this model,ep010
960,is called Jaya and the asking price is,ep010
963,eight hundred and seventy seven thousand,ep010
966,so great price honey it is I love this,ep010
969,exterior it's exactly what I was,ep010
972,thinking of for a Miami house meit's,ep010
975,contemporary 11 oh they did a great job,ep010
978,at the landscaping it's clean and simple,ep010
981,critters oh wow this is really pretty oh,ep010
984,yeah love it the finishes look really,ep010
987,beautiful but it is a little tight it's,ep010
990,narrow but I do like the open concept,ep010
993,you know you have your open space your,ep010
996,living room dining room on your kitchen,ep010
999,as well this kitchen is beautiful it's,ep010
1002,gorgeous nice warm woods and lots of,ep010
1005,whites it might be a tiny bit small okay,ep010
1008,but I think the high ceilings and and,ep010
1011,opening up to everything really kind of,ep010
1014,counters that it does good okay so we,ep010
1017,have four bedrooms three baths there's a,ep010
1020,bedroom and a bathroom down here is,ep010
1023,there a garage,ep010
1026,there's no garage okay so maybe the,ep010
1029,bedroom down here can work us immediate,ep010
1032,room for you guys what do you guys think,ep010
1035,a media room it's would be a little,ep010
1038,tight a little tight but I love it as an,ep010
1041,office and that we can't live without an,ep010
1044,office space in the house yeah,ep010
1047,interesting if there's a door on the,ep010
1050,side there yeah you can come in and out,ep010
1053,in and out I'm thinking more teenage,ep010
1056,boys coming in and out that's an option,ep010
1059,it's not an absolutely they take a look,ep010
1062,at the full bath next door then head,ep010
1065,outside to see the pool you have two,ep010
1068,letters here's with a jack-and-jill,ep010
1071,bathroom,ep010
1074,the floors are gorgeous really well done,ep010
1077,and a beautiful room too you have two,ep010
1080,double sinks here for the girls great,ep010
1083,across the hall is the master suite,ep010
1086,your huge walk-in closet this isn't it,ep010
1089,great needs to be built out well you can,ep010
1092,build it out to your knees right so,ep010
1095,let's go see the master bathroom I do,ep010
1098,love the finishes in here first ball,ep010
1101,like I am seeing the neighbor,ep010
1104,yeah and I'm seeing right into their,ep010
1107,bathroom she's right I mean we are very,ep010
1110,intimate with the neighbors I'm,ep010
1113,surprised the contractor didn't frost,ep010
1116,the windows why they left it open like,ep010
1119,that you are looking directly in from,ep010
1122,toilets a toilet bathtub too bathtub,ep010
1125,[Music],ep010
1128,nice science or not incredibly exposed,ep010
1131,yeah,ep010
1134,the houses are right there but I love,ep010
1137,the the duck right off of the master it,ep010
1140,feels much bigger well this is a great,ep010
1143,size mm-hmm it is,ep010
1146,from start to finish walking in you know,ep010
1149,the modern feel and style pool I mean,ep010
1152,there's a lot of things that you know,ep010
1155,check surprises would you agree I love,ep010
1158,the look of it it is the design style,ep010
1161,that I love but there's a couple,ep010
1164,downsides of sure off the privacy,ep010
1167,concerns and the fact that there's not,ep010
1170,the potential for a media room is really,ep010
1173,big deal for us but with several other,ep010
1176,options the choice won't be easy,ep010
1179,they all have pros and cons so it could,ep010
1182,come down to the garage and private pool,ep010
1185,it's gonna be tough there's things I,ep010
1188,like and I just like about all about,ep010
1191,[Music],ep010
1194,Ryan and fiance melesa are on the hunt,ep010
1197,for their first place together in Miami,ep010
1200,Florida for themselves and Brian's two,ep010
1203,"daughters with a budget of $900,000",ep010
1206,they've seen several options but now,ep010
1209,must decide why don't we start with that,ep010
1212,mid-century modern house casa parade 79,ep010
1215,within our budget I loved walking in and,ep010
1218,seeing that larger living space right it,ep010
1221,did have a nice feel and it did have its,ep010
1224,own pool but some of the bedrooms were,ep010
1227,small and the kitchen wasn't what they,ep010
1230,were looking for tiny and the weird,ep010
1233,dining room off the kitchen means that,ep010
1236,we'd have to basically renovate that,ep010
1239,whole space no in addition to the media,ep010
1242,room right so you've got more than just,ep010
1245,a few projects their second option is a,ep010
1248,two-story townhome 1.1 million for a,ep010
1251,townhouse over our budget way over our,ep010
1254,budget and the outdoor space is small,ep010
1257,with no private pool but I did love how,ep010
1260,the renovation was done on the inside,ep010
1263,yeah the kitchen the open floor plan the,ep010
1266,great master suite also it's very low,ep010
1269,mean,ep010
1272,it's kind of nice that you don't have to,ep010
1275,worry about the lawn that's true,ep010
1278,now how about the ultra super modern,ep010
1281,it's exactly what I was envisioning for,ep010
1284,us it is modern and contemporary and for,ep010
1287,877 having a brand-new construction it,ep010
1290,really is a great great bargain but,ep010
1293,there were some issues the backyard was,ep010
1296,super tiny no opportunity for a media,ep010
1299,room and there's the issues with privacy,ep010
1302,[Music],ep010
1305,the one I think we can eliminate right,ep010
1308,away is the town house I totally agree,ep010
1311,it's you know over our budget,ep010
1314,I love the ultra-modern but the privacy,ep010
1317,issue is something I can't live with the,ep010
1320,mid-century modern home might be a,ep010
1323,better fit for us because it's got a,ep010
1326,bigger patio and pool we could do some,ep010
1329,of the renovations later on I agree I,ep010
1332,think it's something that we can do over,ep010
1335,time this century modern mid-century,ep010
1338,modern it is all right let's give a nice,ep010
1341,drink on top of the good news okay this,ep010
1344,is to be the first time yeah finally,ep010
1347,right so we closed on the house a month,ep010
1350,ago and unfortunately we had a vacation,ep010
1353,scheduled three days after our closing,ep010
1356,so we are about 50% moved in maybe 20% I,ep010
1359,will get you organized in no time oh you,ep010
1362,are so funny see the asking price was,ep010
1365,879 and we actually got it for 866 we,ep010
1368,know that we have to put money into this,ep010
1371,house but we didn't mind because we were,ep010
1374,getting so many things that we had,ep010
1377,wanted we got the pool,ep010
1380,we got the bedrooms for the girls office,ep010
1383,for myself the potential to make a media,ep010
1386,room which is huge and that kitchen,ep010
1389,renovation is gonna be gorgeous,ep010
1392,so I envision taking down this wall okay,ep010
1395,and maybe having some sort of an island,ep010
1398,slash dining table but their top,ep010
1401,priority is the curb appeal,ep010
1404,we've already ripped out all of the,ep010
1407,excess landscaping there's no more,ep010
1410,bushes for criticizing we're gonna,ep010
1413,redesign the front landscaping and,ep010
1416,that's gonna make a huge difference to,ep010
1419,the house honey,ep010

12,this nice Laney and Tyler are moving,ep011
15,back to Missouri and buying their first,ep011
18,home and she in particular is looking,ep011
21,for character I love how these faucets,ep011
24,come out of the wall that's a really,ep011
27,cute feature,ep011
30,oh he's more concerned about finding a,ep011
33,home with a garage big enough for his,ep011
36,oversized truck,ep011
39,we're definitely about just get a,ep011
42,shorter track and while she's also open,ep011
45,to doing some projects I roll a mean,ep011
48,roller I think we'd have to put a mantel,ep011
51,up I think I'd repaint this wall color,ep011
54,projects are adding up for Tyler it's,ep011
57,all about the floors there's no carpet,ep011
60,I'll buy you some slippers yeah but I,ep011
63,want to feel warm and comfortable in a,ep011
66,bathroom okay,ep011
69,[Music],ep011
72,thanks honey I'm Tyler I am 28 I am a,ep011
75,pilot in the Air Force I'm lady I'm 29,ep011
78,years old and I'm a labor and delivery,ep011
81,nurse you're gonna be home by 7:00 Yeah,ep011
84,right,ep011
87,we met at a bar when I was on call and,ep011
90,drinking a pitcher of water she asked me,ep011
93,for a glass of water and she was in love,ep011
96,ever since maybe tomorrow you can make,ep011
99,breakfast,ep011
102,sure Tyler is quite enthusiastic he gets,ep011
105,bored if he sits around for too long so,ep011
108,I like to give him things to do she's,ep011
111,constantly worried about me getting,ep011
114,things done I do tend to be a taskmaster,ep011
117,so I'm sure that drives him crazy but we,ep011
120,get things accomplished I'm excited,ep011
123,finally getting some Barbies we're,ep011
126,actually both from Missouri for the last,ep011
129,several years we've been in the,ep011
132,southwest I got transferred for work and,ep011
135,it worked out for us because we're,ep011
138,moving back home we got to figure out,ep011
141,where we're gonna live they're currently,ep011
144,staying with Lanie's mom Connie in,ep011
147,Sedalia don't need a supervisor I'm here,ep011
150,my house is great for me but having,ep011
153,three people here it's been a little,ep011
156,wild and crazy so Tyler and Laney are on,ep011
159,the hunt for their own home and while,ep011
162,they love Sedalia they plan to move to,ep011
165,Warrensburg 30 minutes away since it's,ep011
168,closer to their jobs I wanna walk,ep011
171,Sedalia and Warrensburg are also known,ep011
174,as mid-missouri it's beautiful there's,ep011
177,always flowers blooming I'm so glad to,ep011
180,finally be back in grass tree yeah you,ep011
183,have all four seasons you don't have the,ep011
186,big bustling city but you can also get,ep011
189,to everything 45 minutes in you're into,ep011
192,Kansas City but they found agreeing on a,ep011
195,first home isn't easy I personally want,ep011
198,a ranch-style that's an open concept I,ep011
201,want to have everything on one floor to,ep011
204,where I can just kind of move it freely,ep011
207,she'd prefer a two-story craftsman I,ep011
210,really appreciate the details in a,ep011
213,Craftsman the woodwork the,ep011
216,no accents and since she personally,ep011
219,likes to craft we do a lot of projects,ep011
222,that's affecting their budget range and,ep011
225,how many projects they're willing to,ep011
228,take on our overall budget is 275 to 325,ep011
231,I personally would rather a,ep011
234,move-in-ready home which more than,ep011
237,likely is gonna be on the higher side of,ep011
240,things I would like to stay in the 275,ep011
243,range so that we have more room in the,ep011
246,budget to change light fixtures paint do,ep011
249,some projects that fixer-upper that you,ep011
252,want is just gonna be even more projects,ep011
255,if you're doing these projects and those,ep011
258,floors are another point of contention,ep011
261,she wants hardwoods I want carpet I like,ep011
264,to walk around barefoot and I don't like,ep011
267,to stub my toes you don't want to stub,ep011
270,your toe pick your feet up I'd really,ep011
273,like to have a big kitchen stainless,ep011
276,steel appliances a big farm sink with a,ep011
279,nice white cabinets modern because it,ep011
282,feels open and fresh I am more,ep011
285,traditional so I don't need alright,ep011
288,trendy things an eat-in breakfast nook,ep011
291,would be great they do agree on some,ep011
294,things like a laundry room and a large,ep011
297,dining space we do have friends over a,ep011
300,lot and we have a nice dining set I'd,ep011
303,like to use we're definitely gonna need,ep011
306,an extra car garage I would love a long,ep011
309,three-car garage my truck is very long,ep011
312,he got this truck because his last one,ep011
315,was totaled in a hailstorm storms always,ep011
318,hurt something in my house so I would,ep011
321,love a storm shelter we are in tornado,ep011
324,alley a finished basement and fenced,ep011
327,yard round out the list we do need to,ep011
330,figure out something I am so excited to,ep011
333,buy a house I feel a little bit old,ep011
336,right now but I'm really excited first,ep011
339,up is a home their agent picked with,ep011
342,Lanie in mind oh wow this is a really,ep011
345,nice craftsman with all the wood accents,ep011
348,and the stonework but it's not the ranch,ep011
351,what I want look at the garage though,ep011
354,there's only two hi guys Hey so what we,ep011
357,have today is the one in a half story,ep011
360,traditional home kind of home lines what,ep011
363,you're looking for it's nice on the,ep011
366,outside it's a four bedroom two and a,ep011
369,"half bath and it's a little over 3,600",ep011
372,square feet whoa 3600 it is huge it's,ep011
375,priced at 279 nine okay,ep011
378,I did already find myself a project I,ep011
381,think I could refinish those shut,ep011
384,they're good you guys like this one okay,ep011
387,okay so come on in this is your foyer,ep011
390,yeah it's hardwood floors yeah yeah not,ep011
393,exactly the color I had in mind,ep011
396,but there's a project for me this over,ep011
399,here is what they're calling a fourth,ep011
402,bedroom this is not a bedroom no,ep011
405,definitely have to be used as an office,ep011
408,but I like the carpets they see a powder,ep011
411,room on their way to the kitchen oh wow,ep011
414,Todd I have mixed feelings the layout is,ep011
417,great but I don't like the colors,ep011
420,well paint is cheap and that's a,ep011
423,projects I roll a mean roller yeah see I,ep011
426,like the colors I think it matches very,ep011
429,well I personally think the kitchen is,ep011
432,gorgeous right over here is your dining,ep011
435,room it's an open floor plan our dining,ep011
438,set would definitely fit in here great,ep011
441,yeah and I want to point out you can put,ep011
444,some chairs under there this is the back,ep011
447,deck okay the artist cute but it's it's,ep011
450,also a little bit smaller than we're,ep011
453,used to I'm kind of worried about the,ep011
456,dogs just you know running around,ep011
459,getting lost back there so I would,ep011
462,definitely definitely have to put a,ep011
465,fence in so this is your living room I,ep011
468,like the big window this fireplace,ep011
471,though is kind of like what well I think,ep011
474,we'd have to put a mantel oh yeah,ep011
477,projects are adding up this is the,ep011
480,master suite,ep011
483,oh wow yeah this is very nice you have a,ep011
486,nice got carpet through the master,ep011
489,closet is the laundry room that is big,ep011
492,that's great and this is your ensuite,ep011
495,this is big and I love how these faucets,ep011
498,come out of the wall what's up with the,ep011
501,carpet yeah that's kind of I like carpet,ep011
504,and a hot in the whole house but that's,ep011
507,kind of taking it to an extreme right,ep011
510,yeah,ep011
513,[Music],ep011
516,okay so up here you have a nice loft,ep011
519,area Ocelot space is a full bag and two,ep011
522,secondary bedrooms you need a very good,ep011
525,room for you know guests or something,ep011
528,along those lines,ep011
531,downstairs they see the garage this is,ep011
534,kind of small yeah we're definitely,ep011
537,about a foot and your basement it is,ep011
540,unfinished and wouldn't be hard to,ep011
543,finish this a lot of people are painting,ep011
546,the concrete now and you can just throw,ep011
549,something drywall up over that way I'm,ep011
552,definitely thinking man man space down,ep011
555,here you can't it's definitely another,ep011
558,project and that that's one of the,ep011
561,biggest concerns I have all we're doing,ep011
564,is adding a project after project after,ep011
567,project is there a storm shelter or,ep011
570,anything in here there really is not a,ep011
573,storm shelter but basically any corner,ep011
576,that you want as long as it's concrete,ep011
579,in case it's considered a storm shelter,ep011
582,okay,ep011
585,what you guys think about there are some,ep011
588,definite things that I liked about it,ep011
591,the laundry room was nice and big the,ep011
594,wood floors are great and I really like,ep011
597,the nice size of the master bathroom and,ep011
600,closet we have plenty of house to go,ep011
603,along with this I mean there's just a,ep011
606,lot of space upstairs it's all carpeted,ep011
609,I love that the big concerns that I had,ep011
612,were no fenton it was only a two-car,ep011
615,garage so there's no way my chart is,ep011
618,gonna fit the basements unfinished I see,ep011
621,lots of projects in my future and that's,ep011
624,what you want but is it I want but it's,ep011
627,not the ranch it's not a move-in ready,ep011
630,that I would like to see so this next,ep011
633,place a ranch is a lot more along the,ep011
636,lines of what Tyler is looking for so we,ep011
639,have a new construction,ep011
642,[Music],ep011
645,yeah I missed us Laney and Tyler,ep011
648,recently moved back to their home state,ep011
651,of Missouri and are excited to get,ep011
654,reacquainted with some local flavor is,ep011
657,the thing about Missouri every day is,ep011
660,barbecue something something something,ep011
663,I'm okay with that,ep011
666,working with a budget of up to three,ep011
669,hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars,ep011
672,they've seen a well-priced craftsman s,ep011
675,traditional that needed updates perfect,ep011
678,for Laney but it had an unfinished,ep011
681,basement the yard wasn't fenced it only,ep011
684,had a two-car garage,ep011
687,and Tyler would prefer a move-in-ready,ep011
690,home so today they're seeing new,ep011
693,construction for Tyler not the craftsman,ep011
696,I was looking for but it is the ranch,ep011
699,we've got a three-car garage thank you,ep011
702,for meeting me here wow so we have a new,ep011
705,construction okay,ep011
708,base models in this development start at,ep011
711,two seventy nine nine with upgrades this,ep011
714,house is listed at just under three,ep011
717,hundred and nine thousand dollars oh wow,ep011
720,it's more than I wanted to spend I like,ep011
723,the colors yeah and the stonework is,ep011
726,beautiful all right well let's go see,ep011
729,what we have come on in,ep011
732,so over here on the right you do have a,ep011
735,coat closet and it's an open concept I,ep011
738,love these floors and these go,ep011
741,throughout the whole place it's all in,ep011
744,the main floor yeah I'd rather carpet,ep011
747,though we'll just put a rug down on top,ep011
750,okay so cover up the floors that you,ep011
753,want by putting a rug why don't you just,ep011
756,have carpet in the first place cuz these,ep011
759,will last longer is this it for the,ep011
762,dining room I don't think our table will,ep011
765,fit here I don't think so and my white,ep011
768,cabinet I still don't really like the,ep011
771,white with the subway tile well yeah,ep011
774,well that's just a new space ripping,ep011
777,quesadillas in here okay alright I know,ep011
780,Tyler doesn't favor the white kitchen,ep011
783,but since I prepare the majority of the,ep011
786,meals I think that's what we'll stick,ep011
789,with Wow,ep011
792,I like this yeah this is a nice deck but,ep011
795,there's no fence for the dogs I get when,ep011
798,we can put in a little one like the,ep011
801,neighbors yes we can back inside they,ep011
804,see two secondary bedrooms this is kind,ep011
807,of small I guess it could be your office,ep011
810,and a guest bath it will work yeah next,ep011
813,I want to show you the laundry room,ep011
816,and again right now I love that,ep011
819,that's tons of space oh yeah that is,ep011
822,actually pretty nice and the master,ep011
825,suite with recessed lighting ceiling fan,ep011
828,the tray ceilings are really pretty yeah,ep011
831,and our stuff would definitely fit in,ep011
834,here there's no carpet I'll buy you some,ep011
837,slippers yeah but I want to feel warm,ep011
840,and comfortable in a bathroom okay and,ep011
843,here is your master bath oh wow,ep011
846,who's a nurse closet from the jetted tub,ep011
849,and it's double sinks the oversized,ep011
852,shower there's no door since it's a new,ep011
855,construction I would talk with the,ep011
858,Builder and maybe we can get one put in,ep011
861,okay okay we have a finished basement,ep011
864,down here yeah I can kind of picture,ep011
867,putting a TV on that wall and count,ep011
870,matches around here so we're in the,ep011
873,basement is there a storm shelters there,ep011
876,is right through that door okay that's,ep011
879,good there's also a full bath and the,ep011
882,fourth bedroom down here,ep011
885,[Music],ep011
888,and the garage it is a three-car garage,ep011
891,it's huge you think your truck with it I,ep011
894,doubt it,ep011
897,yeah I think we're gonna be about three,ep011
900,inches short where do you park your,ep011
903,truck if it hails,ep011
906,I lost my last truck to Hale and if it,ep011
909,hails a lot around here I don't want to,ep011
912,completely damage my brand-new truck,ep011
915,we only have two vehicles so you can,ep011
918,pull in on the third one and I could,ep011
921,kind of angle so what'd you guys think,ep011
924,of that I really loved the the,ep011
927,downstairs the storm shelter a safety,ep011
930,factor for us so it's definitely my kind,ep011
933,of house I love the kitchen the outsides,ep011
936,not really what I had in mind well I,ep011
939,like the ranch it's move-in ready but,ep011
942,when I get here I can't paint anything I,ep011
945,can't fix any rooms up I think I'd like,ep011
948,to see something with a little more,ep011
951,character but character is open to,ep011
954,interpretation oh I think this is a,ep011
957,split-level,ep011
960,[Music],ep011
963,before a walk Laney and Tyler excited to,ep011
966,move back to Missouri where they can,ep011
969,enjoy the outdoors year-round yeah we,ep011
972,like working out in the yard she thinks,ep011
975,she has a green thumb yes I used a lot,ep011
978,of fertilizer now we're gonna have to,ep011
981,see if there's a dog park somewhere in,ep011
984,that we can let them off a leash hiking,ep011
987,trails are fun anything outdoors really,ep011
990,is kind of our thing working with a,ep011
993,three hundred and twenty five thousand,ep011
996,dollar budget they've seen a well-priced,ep011
999,traditional with craftsman touches that,ep011
1002,Lanie liked but the small garage and,ep011
1005,unfinished basement turned off Tyler,ep011
1008,then they saw a move-in-ready ranch with,ep011
1011,a dedicated storm shelter and Lanie's,ep011
1014,white kitchen but Tyler would have to,ep011
1017,squeeze his massive truck into the,ep011
1020,garage and there was no fence,ep011
1023,it was also higher in the budget and,ep011
1026,there'd be no DIY projects for Laney so,ep011
1029,today they're seeing another option oh I,ep011
1032,think this is a split-level doesn't look,ep011
1035,bad,ep011
1038,I can see ourselves in it it's got a,ep011
1041,three-car garage yeah I'll just start,ep011
1044,hey Lanie,ep011
1047,hi so I'm hoping that you like this one,ep011
1050,surprised at 264 nine Oh some below well,ep011
1053,it's going to take a look awesome,ep011
1056,alright guys so this is a split foyer I,ep011
1059,just don't like how you can see both,ep011
1062,upstairs and downstairs at the same time,ep011
1065,yeah it's kinda got carpet that I like,ep011
1068,hardwoods that you like yeah that's true,ep011
1071,that's a compromise,ep011
1074,Lori's actually working to try and find,ep011
1077,something that Lanie and I are both can,ep011
1080,compromise on fellini we have beautiful,ep011
1083,cherry hardwood floors and I wanted you,ep011
1086,to see how open it is yeah I like the,ep011
1089,open concept yeah we have a beautiful,ep011
1092,granite countertop lots of cabinet space,ep011
1095,and they're white kind of white ish yeah,ep011
1098,they're lighter though it's so pretty,ep011
1101,you know we could put barstools up here,ep011
1104,this would be a nice little spot for,ep011
1107,breakfast we have your stainless steel,ep011
1110,appliances and a copper farm sink that's,ep011
1113,a really cute feature but there's no,ep011
1116,formal dining room but I think I'd,ep011
1119,repaint this wall colors come looks like,ep011
1122,they put butter on the wall makes you,ep011
1125,own a baked potato this deck they just,ep011
1128,refurbished I love the deck this is a,ep011
1131,nice space yeah but I do see a problem,ep011
1134,there's no fence no there's not,ep011
1137,the yard is kind of small nothing I can,ep011
1140,do about the yard but you can't put a,ep011
1143,fence up yeah yeah the dogs could,ep011
1146,definitely run around out here back,ep011
1149,inside they see a guest bedroom and full,ep011
1152,bath oh wow it's pretty then they head,ep011
1155,to the master oh it's kind of small over,ep011
1158,here is your master suite,ep011
1161,oh my word okay there's no door it's,ep011
1164,definitely unique in here it's different,ep011
1167,I've never seen that style sink before,ep011
1170,Oh in that coop fun but I'm really,ep011
1173,concerned about the door the trash and,ep011
1176,then one of those barn doors or whatever,ep011
1179,you call it on there or something,ep011
1182,there's a lot of good things but I think,ep011
1185,there's a lot of renovation projects,ep011
1188,that I'm gonna have to do in order to,ep011
1191,get it to where I and Lady would want us,ep011
1194,to be at Tyler it's a move-in-ready,ep011
1197,house but this house is toward the,ep011
1200,bottom of our budget even if we do the,ep011
1203,things I wanted to do I think we'd still,ep011
1206,have money left over alright guys so,ep011
1209,this is your man's face second family,ep011
1212,room I could definitely see entertaining,ep011
1215,down here do we have a storm shelter or,ep011
1218,any,ep011
1221,around there's not one in this one okay,ep011
1224,there's also a laundry room a full bath,ep011
1227,and two more guest bedrooms down here I,ep011
1230,like this for an office and here is the,ep011
1233,garage a little bit smaller you should,ep011
1236,just get a shorter truck that's way,ep011
1239,easier than getting a bigger house if I,ep011
1242,can angle it that might help we can,ep011
1245,figure something out I can definitely,ep011
1248,see the split that you tried to do his,ep011
1251,downstairs hers upstairs I do like the,ep011
1254,way that the floor plan is open up here,ep011
1257,I like the light cabinets it feels very,ep011
1260,light aside from this butter color on,ep011
1263,the walls I can't stand the master with,ep011
1266,no door to the bathroom,ep011
1269,it is a lot lower on the budget and that,ep011
1272,gives me plenty of room to do all these,ep011
1275,little things that I want to do to it,ep011
1278,I'm getting tired of living with,ep011
1281,mother-in-law so hopefully we can make a,ep011
1284,decision soon and since none of the,ep011
1287,houses have a fenced yard Laney and,ep011
1290,Tyler may have to decide what's most,ep011
1293,important a large dining space a big,ep011
1296,master suite or nabbing that three-car,ep011
1299,garage we have a big decision to make,ep011
1302,[Music],ep011
1305,what do you think about all these houses,ep011
1308,we've seen I think we need to go through,ep011
1311,them Laney and Tyler have up to three,ep011
1314,hundred and twenty five thousand dollars,ep011
1317,to spend on a house in Warrensburg,ep011
1320,Missouri they've seen several options,ep011
1323,now it's decision time what's the first,ep011
1326,one that's the traditional right uh-huh,ep011
1329,priced at 279 nine the price is right it,ep011
1332,is pretty much move-in ready and it was,ep011
1335,a huge house I really liked the layout,ep011
1338,there and the master setup was nice I,ep011
1341,didn't like the kitchen at all there's,ep011
1344,enough space downstairs for me to have,ep011
1347,some man's face but it didn't really,ep011
1350,have a storm shelter what did you think,ep011
1353,of a new-construction ranch the price,ep011
1356,was just under three hundred nine a,ep011
1359,little bit high but it is moving ready,ep011
1362,but I can't really put my stamp on,ep011
1365,something like that but it has the,ep011
1368,hardwoods that you want upstairs it has,ep011
1371,a carpet I want downstairs but fencing,ep011
1374,you know a large yard is quite a bit of,ep011
1377,money well what did you think about that,ep011
1380,split-level traditional it was really,ep011
1383,under budget at 264 nine I personally,ep011
1386,like it because as soon as you walk in,ep011
1389,you go straight down stairs for my man,ep011
1392,space or you go straight upstairs for,ep011
1395,the kitchen the kitchen was nice lots of,ep011
1398,cabinet and counter space but I think we,ep011
1401,got a little bit too much into that open,ep011
1404,concept when you go into the master,ep011
1407,bedroom straight into that master,ep011
1410,bathroom I think we definitely need to,ep011
1413,make a decision,ep011
1416,I personally want the turnkey ranch,ep011
1419,I think the downstairs being my man's,ep011
1422,face with carpet that's what I want,ep011
1425,believe it or not that's all I like to I,ep011
1428,don't get to put my stamp on things but,ep011
1431,if you give me some space to work on my,ep011
1434,other little projects I think it would,ep011
1437,be a good compromise you ready to make,ep011
1440,an offer and call Lori yeah let's give,ep011
1443,her a call all right hey this is for the,ep011
1446,party we bought the house about six,ep011
1449,weeks ago and then we moved in a couple,ep011
1452,weeks after that could you grab the,ep011
1455,hummus out the fridge yeah the house was,ep011
1458,listed for 308 for 75 waited up going in,ep011
1461,for an all-in offer that cost I think,ep011
1464,we're ready okay I personally wanted,ep011
1467,this house because it was a ranch it,ep011
1470,also gave me my man space downstairs I,ep011
1473,have the guest room the wet bar the,ep011
1476,finished space it's wonderful and we,ep011
1479,love the layout especially the kitchen,ep011
1482,we both were able to get kind of what we,ep011
1485,wanted you ready to try this oh brother,ep011
1488,yeah let's do it and with some creative,ep011
1491,maneuvering Tyler is able to get his,ep011
1494,truck in the garage my favorite space in,ep011
1497,the house is definitely the back patio,ep011
1500,it's really nice and relaxing with a,ep011
1503,great view but with the budget being as,ep011
1506,high as it was we did have to compromise,ep011
1509,and not have a fence yet so that is,ep011
1512,gonna be an extra expense that I wasn't,ep011
1515,really wanted to have the compromises I,ep011
1518,made in this house are the fact that I,ep011
1521,didn't get to do any renovations to it,ep011
1524,that's because I got my move-in-ready,ep011
1527,house but I've gotten to do other,ep011
1530,smaller projects so I haven't really,ep011
1533,noticed I like it out here it's nice we,ep011
1536,weren't really sure what owning a home,ep011
1539,actually entail,ep011
1542,definitely more adulting now although my,ep011
1545,mom's 30 minutes away so she's on,ep011
1548,speed-dial mom I need your help we don't,ep011
1551,have a whole lot of stuff to do that was,ep011
1554,the reason we picked it so come on take,ep011
1557,that bit our future plans in the house,ep011
1560,are actually to build friends with,ep011
1563,neighbors and just enjoy life a little,ep011
1566,bit we're gonna stay here for a while,ep011
1569,you,ep011
12,oh my gosh that's too cool Jerry and,ep012
15,Emily are leaving Florida for a new,ep012
18,family home in Chattanooga Tennessee,ep012
21,this is the entertainment room oh thanks,ep012
24,but there are miles apart on the most,ep012
27,important decision I want my max letter,ep012
30,to be able to use it,ep012
33,I think 350 thousand would be more in my,ep012
36,range you said our budget was down to,ep012
39,250 I said 350,ep012
42,it's hotter than a kiss for a minute and,ep012
45,as this house Sun heats up so will their,ep012
48,tempers you got to be kidding me,ep012
51,this cannot be kids are way down here,ep012
54,you can have,ep012
57,[Music],ep012
60,we have some great candidates this week,ep012
63,absolutely,ep012
66,I'm Emily I work with recruiting for a,ep012
69,large entertainment company,ep012
72,I'm Jerry I'm a product marketing,ep012
75,manager for a laser scanning technology,ep012
78,are you guys excited yes we met eight,ep012
81,years ago our first date we discovered,ep012
84,that we have a lot in common we even,ep012
87,have the same birthday we got married,ep012
90,two years later to the date if you have,ep012
93,three kids and no time for anything no,ep012
96,you're a paleontologist we've been,ep012
99,living in Orlando for twenty years and,ep012
102,we now are able to have the flexibility,ep012
105,with both of our jobs being from home to,ep012
108,live wherever we want and so we decided,ep012
111,to pick Chattanooga as a middle ground,ep012
114,it's a halfway point between both of our,ep012
117,families I'm from Texas he's from Boston,ep012
120,but it also provides us the outdoor,ep012
123,recreation that we love the quality,ep012
126,lifestyle that community feel that we,ep012
129,like great place to raise the kids the,ep012
132,school system is great and helping them,ep012
135,make the move from Florida to,ep012
138,Chattanooga is there agent Marcus Holt,ep012
141,tell me a little bit about your budget,ep012
144,I want my Mack Center to be run 250 I,ep012
147,would like to have a 15-year mortgage,ep012
150,that will give us the ability to have,ep012
153,the type of retirement that I think we,ep012
156,both deserve but finding the perfect,ep012
159,house with all the amenities that we're,ep012
162,asking for at 250 is going to be nearly,ep012
165,impossible I think three and fifty,ep012
168,thousand would be more in my range you,ep012
171,could definitely get a turnkey house and,ep012
174,a lot of the amenities that we're both,ep012
177,looking for however I'm fine with a,ep012
180,project or two projects don't scare,ep012
183,projects don't scare me it's the time,ep012
186,that secures meaning we don't have the,ep012
189,time Oh,ep012
192,moving ready I would like a ranch-style,ep012
195,house all on one floor that way the kids,ep012
198,veterans are near ours I prefer a,ep012
201,colonial or Cape cod-style that's why I,ep012
204,grew up with a New England something,ep012
207,that we do agree on is we want something,ep012
210,with at least four bedrooms we have,ep012
213,"three kids so I mean we need 2,500 to",ep012
216,"3,000 square feet plus we both work from",ep012
219,home so having a dedicated office is,ep012
222,critical and guest quarters any friends,ep012
225,or family that want to come at any time,ep012
228,have that space to do so very easily,ep012
231,you've wanted to be close to downtown,ep012
234,would you like to be out on the borders,ep012
237,of the city,ep012
240,city it doesn't have a yard I don't even,ep012
243,look at it we need a Kurds and I mean,ep012
246,two three acres of land flat backyard,ep012
249,that's usable and practical to play,ep012
252,sports have functions like cookouts and,ep012
255,entertainment with the family when the,ep012
258,family comes over I've been trying to,ep012
261,convince Terry that we're looking for a,ep012
264,house in the mountains so a flat,ep012
267,backyard mm a half acre is fine with me,ep012
270,if we can get a pool in that half acre I,ep012
273,would love it if the house is right the,ep012
276,backyard does not have to be completely,ep012
279,flat also high on the list is a large,ep012
282,master suite with separate vanities in,ep012
285,the bathroom for nice padded I like,ep012
288,Granite's I like a nice backsplash I,ep012
291,want some upgrades that really make it,ep012
294,pop bead from New England I grew up with,ep012
297,a fireplace so it's something that's,ep012
300,really important to me,ep012
303,I like powered floors high ceilings the,ep012
306,other key thing is I like a finished,ep012
309,basement entertainment room where I can,ep012
312,watch football get through the maze I,ep012
315,think we're also both stubborn people at,ep012
318,times there are certain things we're not,ep012
321,willing to concede so it would be,ep012
324,interesting to find out where we do,ep012
327,compromise to meet in the middle,ep012
330,first up is a house in the suburb of,ep012
333,Mill Run seems to be a ranch-style all,ep012
336,right yeah it looks like it's all on one,ep012
339,floor where you going,ep012
342,I've won the backyard that's the first,ep012
345,place that needs to go Chris yeah you,ep012
348,got to be kidding me,ep012
351,this is not flat all right it's not that,ep012
354,bad doesn't have you pool in but the,ep012
357,yard is huge that's exactly what we're,ep012
360,looking for,ep012
363,hey there you guys go we do you think I,ep012
366,was I was in the backyard of course you,ep012
369,heard they've been looking for,ep012
372,acreage in the flat backyard this house,ep012
375,actually has neither but I'll take a,ep012
378,look inside only because my wife tells,ep012
381,me I need to be more this one's gonna be,ep012
384,a four-bedroom three-bath house has,ep012
387,"2,800 square feet",ep012
390,and the big thing is it's only 240,ep012
393,thousand dollars awesome hardwood floors,ep012
396,I like it right out here this is dining,ep012
399,room,ep012
402,watch the game but look at powered,ep012
405,floors I absolutely love the fireplace,ep012
408,yeah this is a pretty big space this is,ep012
411,a nice deck that's a plus,ep012
414,Marcus it's not granite,ep012
417,I know it's not granite at your budget,ep012
420,you know this is what you're gonna get,ep012
423,if it was at my budget we probably would,ep012
426,get a granite countertop yeah I mean I,ep012
429,guess everything's stainless and you,ep012
432,like stainless but it is a little dated,ep012
435,for my taste,ep012
438,this is wallpaper I'm not sure I'm crazy,ep012
441,about that backslash wallpaper I don't,ep012
444,need a wallpaper backsplash in babies,ep012
447,definitely doesn't have the upgrades I'm,ep012
450,looking for let's take out the master,ep012
453,bedroom,ep012
456,it's kind of small it's actually very,ep012
459,small I kind of wanted a little bit,ep012
462,bigger room that we have now she wants,ep012
465,separate sinks the key to marital,ep012
468,harmony is split sinks I mean I love the,ep012
471,jetted tub but B it could go and this,ep012
474,would be an awesome like makeup area and,ep012
477,then ooh you could have your seat take,ep012
480,out the tub and then there's your second,ep012
483,sink or you could up the budget and have,ep012
486,everything what you want right away I,ep012
489,mean a little project here and there we,ep012
492,can do them over time and then we can,ep012
495,stay on budget,ep012
498,our financial plan is in place across,ep012
501,the first floor is a bathroom and two,ep012
504,kids rooms I mean you could conceivably,ep012
507,put two kids in her I guess you'd have,ep012
510,to with only two veterans up here we,ep012
513,still have a bedroom downstairs this,ep012
516,would have to be a guest quarters though,ep012
519,this gaddafi kid's room way down here to,ep012
522,the left you have the third bathroom,ep012
525,right off their guest room right perfect,ep012
528,I really think you're gonna love this,ep012
531,space here this is the game room this is,ep012
534,where it's at this should be fantastic I,ep012
537,think there's one other space that you,ep012
540,guys are gonna love what is this they're,ep012
543,still moving out so some of their stuff,ep012
546,still here maybe you could use part of,ep012
549,it as your office so there's no,ep012
552,dedicated office in the house,ep012
555,convert this to an office we kind of,ep012
558,need that going in so we can start,ep012
561,working immediately it's gonna be hard,ep012
564,to find everything that they're looking,ep012
567,for but he's also willing to pay for it,ep012
570,but Emily's not I think they have to,ep012
573,have a come-to-jesus meeting and figure,ep012
576,out what's really truly important good,ep012
579,job picking it out to show us I love the,ep012
582,side but don't love is the bedrooms are,ep012
585,far apart I was extremely disappointed,ep012
588,about the yard the other thing is I have,ep012
591,to basically build a home office in,ep012
594,scratch I want something turnkey it,ep012
597,could be a very quick 2 month project,ep012
600,very affordable but the one thing I did,ep012
603,love is the bonus room I mean that can,ep012
606,be easily converted to an entertainment,ep012
609,room but again if we look at something,ep012
612,with a larger budget maybe it could,ep012
615,include other features that are missing,ep012
618,in this house so now Marcus has lined up,ep012
621,a home on over 2 acres for Gerry but it,ep012
624,may be a stretch for both of them,ep012
627,"375,000 whoa swing Florida transplants",ep012
630,Emily and Gerry are searching suburban,ep012
633,Chattanooga Tennessee for a new family,ep012
636,home but they have conflicting,ep012
639,priorities she wants to stay on the low,ep012
642,end of their 250 to 350 thousand dollar,ep012
645,budget so they can pay the house off in,ep012
648,15 years but he would rather spend more,ep012
651,if it gets them a huge yard for the kids,ep012
654,so far they've seen a ranch that was,ep012
657,under her budget but it wasn't moving,ep012
660,for Jerry and it lacked the pool Emily,ep012
663,was hoping for so today their agent,ep012
666,Marcus has found an updated house in the,ep012
669,Yorktown woods neighborhood but he,ep012
672,thinks could be a good compromise,ep012
675,definitely has a colonial feel look,ep012
678,sound like a ranch as well that was is,ep012
681,it all one floor it's actually three,ep012
684,floors four bedrooms four and a half,ep012
687,"baths a little bit under 4,000 square",ep012
690,"feet 375,000 Wow I know it's a little",ep012
693,high but has two and a half acres of,ep012
696,land could we afford it sure but I'm not,ep012
699,paying 375 for a house it's gonna,ep012
702,totally screw up our financial planner,ep012
705,Marcus you know how we feel about the,ep012
708,backyard yeah no let's go check it out I,ep012
711,love it that's my kind of pool we've got,ep012
714,the diving board man is asleep but,ep012
717,there's no space probably an acre of,ep012
720,this property is in the woods it's not,ep012
723,usable maybe we can clear some of this,ep012
726,so for 375 we are going to then be,ep012
729,paying money to clear land did I miss,ep012
732,something you said our budget was down,ep012
735,to 250 I said 350 this is higher than,ep012
738,what we both initially thought all right,ep012
741,no you're right it's higher than I want,ep012
744,this for a minute all right so why don't,ep012
747,we do that but I'm just telling you that,ep012
750,the backyard doesn't work for me all,ep012
753,right I like the hardwood floors now,ep012
756,they aren't few different colors which,ep012
759,is kind of odd what we're standing in,ep012
762,right now all right so this is gonna be,ep012
765,your formal living room it seems a,ep012
768,little small but you like the molding,ep012
771,this is the formal dining I definitely,ep012
774,like this kitchen I love this backsplash,ep012
777,I think you have some granite countertop,ep012
780,yeah ooh a devil oven nice for,ep012
783,Thanksgiving meals we have lots of,ep012
786,family over yeah that's how great that,ep012
789,is great and this is gonna be your,ep012
792,family,ep012
795,nice wood mantel Howard floors I like it,ep012
798,I love the crown molding you know,ep012
801,overall the inside of the house has a,ep012
804,lot of upgrades so that I really like it,ep012
807,could offset the yard to a degree so you,ep012
810,know what I gotta be more open to that,ep012
813,Wow I really like this room this is a,ep012
816,great office yes this should work for,ep012
819,both of our desks across the living room,ep012
822,is the master bedroom,ep012
825,so the first wow this is a really big,ep012
828,master a nice tray ceiling,ep012
831,I like that isn't her cause all this,ep012
834,space that if an awesome feature this,ep012
837,house surprised me I really like it,ep012
840,actually I wasn't prepared to because,ep012
843,it's way out of budget next it's,ep012
846,downstairs to see the basement oh wow,ep012
849,this is big this could be a great,ep012
852,entertainment room and you also get a,ep012
855,full bath on this level okay great,ep012
858,there are two bedrooms up here so,ep012
861,there's no bedrooms on the main floor,ep012
864,near the master no bedrooms on the main,ep012
867,floor near best yeah that's a little bit,ep012
870,of a problem they see a bedroom that,ep012
873,would work for one of the kids and pass,ep012
876,through a jack-and-jill bath on the way,ep012
879,to the next bedroom Wow large room this,ep012
882,is a perfect place for bunk beds twin,ep012
885,beds or whatever okay did you had to,ep012
888,walk through the kids room or whatever,ep012
891,this room would be to get to okay yes,ep012
894,whoa I really like it now is this a,ep012
897,closet this is actually not a closet,ep012
900,this is what I was using as a surprise,ep012
903,for you guys,ep012
906,this is actually own entryway oh wow for,ep012
909,this room so you can just close that,ep012
912,door off they don't even have to walk,ep012
915,through that room they have their own,ep012
918,bathroom this would make a great guest,ep012
921,space,ep012
924,[Applause],ep012
927,it's got a lot of space it has a lot of,ep012
930,flex pace I don't want that the master,ep012
933,is down here on the first floor and not,ep012
936,up at the other bedroom but obviously I,ep012
939,love the backyard is fantastic I say,ep012
942,probably the backyard for me was the,ep012
945,biggest disappointment but I was very,ep012
948,impressed with the different types of,ep012
951,details like the granite counter and the,ep012
954,molding I mean it is over budget,ep012
957,it sounds a bit an education on what we,ep012
960,can get at that higher price point yes,ep012
963,yeah so now Marcus has lined up a house,ep012
966,that's priced right but it comes with a,ep012
969,compromise I cannot wait till you just,ep012
972,have some down time here as a family,ep012
975,Laurita transplants Emily and Gerry have,ep012
978,up to three hundred and fifty thousand,ep012
981,to spend on a family home in suburban,ep012
984,Chattanooga Tennessee but they're,ep012
987,dueling budgets and high expectations,ep012
990,have been a challenge so far they've,ep012
993,seen a house under Emily's budget but,ep012
996,Gerry felt spending more would give them,ep012
999,the upgrade they're looking for then,ep012
1002,they saw a home with a lot of upgrades,ep012
1005,but the three hundred and seventy five,ep012
1008,thousand dollar price tag was too steep,ep012
1011,even for Jared,ep012
1014,so today their agent Marcus has lined up,ep012
1017,a home near the North Ridge Lake,ep012
1020,neighborhood that could split the,ep012
1023,difference,ep012
1026,gotta all brick colonial I love it yeah,ep012
1029,I wouldn't have thought I would but it's,ep012
1032,charming six bedroom three and a half,ep012
1035,"bath house and it has 3,700 square feet",ep012
1038,list price,ep012
1041,305 it's within our budget that's above,ep012
1044,my budget but can we first take a look,ep012
1047,at the backyard let's go and do that the,ep012
1050,community does have a pool I will give,ep012
1053,it to you the one thing this does have,ep012
1056,is that it's flat but it's all cement,ep012
1059,you do get a really nice back deck,ep012
1062,overlooking the force here this is,ep012
1065,beautiful,ep012
1068,I just wish there's a little bit more,ep012
1071,yard to work with I'm just really,ep012
1074,disappointed I'm just looking for a flat,ep012
1077,piece of open land and I'm not finding,ep012
1080,it anywhere come on in check it out Wow,ep012
1083,I like the Bannister in the railing,ep012
1086,nice-sized dining room powered floors,ep012
1089,chair and the chair,ep012
1092,oh wow look at this that is a unique,ep012
1095,built-in that is very interesting you're,ep012
1098,gonna love this oh my gosh that's gonna,ep012
1101,be cool then bookcase in here is a focal,ep012
1104,point a little offbeat but I think you,ep012
1107,could have some creative fun with that I,ep012
1110,really love this fireplace,ep012
1113,this is exactly what you see I love this,ep012
1116,oh my gosh yeah I like the countertops,ep012
1119,these are not granite,ep012
1122,but they're nice like yeah I mean it,ep012
1125,definitely goes well with the color of,ep012
1128,the brick next they head downstairs to,ep012
1131,see the basement Wow this is the,ep012
1134,entertainment room Wow okay this could,ep012
1137,be probably a nice dedicated office here,ep012
1140,you already have some built-in shelves,ep012
1143,and cabinets yeah on the other end of,ep012
1146,the basement is a full guest suite this,ep012
1149,is perfect it is right down off the back,ep012
1152,exactly there's a lot of space to play,ep012
1155,with have enough room for our kids,ep012
1158,and plenty of room for extra guests,ep012
1161,upstairs they look at four bedrooms,ep012
1164,every one of our kids can,ep012
1167,this is basic here on the way to the,ep012
1170,shared bath oh my gosh does two safes in,ep012
1173,here,ep012
1176,the girls would each have their own,ep012
1179,sinks when they're teenagers getting,ep012
1182,ready in the morning that's the good,ep012
1185,thing I think you got your master,ep012
1188,bedroom or just tray ceiling and it's,ep012
1191,just a short hallway away from the kids,ep012
1194,room I mean this is great look at this,ep012
1197,yeah this is definitely enough marble,ep012
1200,countertops together but at least we,ep012
1203,have separate sinks right yeah I mean,ep012
1206,this together so we have to share it,ep012
1209,it's play nice absolutely,ep012
1212,this is nice fear making the wrong,ep012
1215,decision it may not be right in that,ep012
1218,sweet spot of the budget that I really,ep012
1221,want but I don't want to pass on,ep012
1224,something that can be a good house for,ep012
1227,our family you have all the space you,ep012
1230,have the extra basement downstairs with,ep012
1233,all those rooms you have a guest room,ep012
1236,and it's got all those cool features I,ep012
1239,like the really neat freak out of a,ep012
1242,feature probably the one thing it,ep012
1245,doesn't have is number-one priority for,ep012
1248,me I want you guys like you already know,ep012
1251,how important that is to you why for,ep012
1254,myself I want for our kids but you got a,ep012
1257,concern this house is at 305 I mean it,ep012
1260,is still way over my budget now it's,ep012
1263,time to decide what's most important the,ep012
1266,budget the backyard a renovation project,ep012
1269,I'm ready to make you sisters in there,ep012
1272,yes yes Florida transplants Jerry and,ep012
1275,Emily have up to 350 grand to spend on a,ep012
1278,new home in Chattanooga Tennessee,ep012
1281,they've seen a number of places now it's,ep012
1284,time to decide what house that we should,ep012
1287,definitely consider the one for 240 the,ep012
1290,ranch that meets all your retirement,ep012
1293,plans for us but you still did not like,ep012
1296,the bedrooms being far away right the,ep012
1299,master was on the opposite side of the,ep012
1302,house from the bedrooms and I'd like to,ep012
1305,be closer to the kids the downstairs did,ep012
1308,feel,ep012
1311,dated didn't have the separate vanities,ep012
1314,and I didn't have an office and we need,ep012
1317,a dedicated office space you did have,ep012
1320,that separate area downstairs for the,ep012
1323,guests and the entertainment area I like,ep012
1326,the hardwood floors I like the fireplace,ep012
1329,the kitchen it was a little bit dated,ep012
1332,but that yard was huge it was sloped but,ep012
1335,it was big the one with the pool for 375,ep012
1338,obviously the budget is is a huge,ep012
1341,concern I mean it was two and a half,ep012
1344,acres but most of that was all woods but,ep012
1347,a love the colonial molding inside the,ep012
1350,house amazing fireplace with a wooden,ep012
1353,mantel the upgraded kitchen it did have,ep012
1356,the office this one the master was even,ep012
1359,further from the kids rooms but the,ep012
1362,house did have that great basement,ep012
1365,you're right I mean I can see it working,ep012
1368,in a lot of ways so what'd you think,ep012
1371,about the large colonial brick house it,ep012
1374,was 305 which is I know comfortable for,ep012
1377,you it's a little more than I would feel,ep012
1380,comfortable with but the house itself,ep012
1383,was wonderful all Howard floors which I,ep012
1386,absolutely loved had a fireplace six,ep012
1389,bedrooms,ep012
1392,plenty of room our families and friends,ep012
1395,to come and visit and the master bedroom,ep012
1398,I thought that was huge the thing with,ep012
1401,this is that yard I know how important,ep012
1404,that is to you and if you know it,ep012
1407,literally had that thing no yard,ep012
1410,whatsoever what do we want to do which,ep012
1413,one will they choose,ep012
1416,you know what I think we should choose,ep012
1419,the ranch with the large yard oh my gosh,ep012
1422,you know it may not have the flat piece,ep012
1425,of property that I'm looking for but it,ep012
1428,was going to allow us to save for our,ep012
1431,future Wow I am shocked I agree I mean,ep012
1434,really yeah,ep012
1437,it doesn't have every single space that,ep012
1440,we need I think between the two of us we,ep012
1443,can be creative and figure absolutely,ep012
1446,were the most creative people on this,ep012
1449,planet that's why we're together let's,ep012
1452,do it let's do it all right we bought,ep012
1455,the house about four months ago or so,ep012
1458,yeah but we moved in just only a few,ep012
1461,weeks ago we were gonna have to make,ep012
1464,multiple trips over the course of,ep012
1467,several months when you're doing across,ep012
1470,country moves with three young children,ep012
1473,"the list price was 240,000 but we",ep012
1476,actually ended up paying two hundred,ep012
1479,forty six thousand there were multiple,ep012
1482,other bids the price obviously was you,ep012
1485,know really important to us because it's,ep012
1488,gonna allow us to make other choices in,ep012
1491,our life and while they'd like to update,ep012
1494,the kitchen and install separate sinks,ep012
1497,in the master bath for now the list of,ep012
1500,projects is short,ep012
1503,we're enclosing an office downstairs but,ep012
1506,other than work that we haven't had to,ep012
1509,do a lot I definitely still do not like,ep012
1512,the master across the house from the,ep012
1515,kids we learned pretty early on that,ep012
1518,compromise was was gonna be necessary on,ep012
1521,some level I'm gonna go to I learned if,ep012
1524,you want,ep012
1527,it's probably not gonna find a large,ep012
1530,plot of flat land so that hit me square,ep012
1533,in the face for sure the kids loved the,ep012
1536,backyard we've added a stand-up hammock,ep012
1539,and it's been great so far the big room,ep012
1542,in the basement,ep012
1545,I've already converted into an,ep012
1548,entertainment room and I've even painted,ep012
1551,a large life-size football field on one,ep012
1554,of the walls you didn't you made about,ep012
1557,yourself all by yourself let me have,ep012
1560,this let me have this moment when people,ep012
1563,walk in there they're really gonna feel,ep012
1566,like all right I am ready to watch the,ep012
1569,football all right what color do you,ep012
1572,want a bonus that I got was downstairs,ep012
1575,when we started converting you the,ep012
1578,office there was extra space so we have,ep012
1581,a dedicated craft area they can play,ep012
1584,playdough they can do projects with,ep012
1587,glitter make a big mess and it's in a,ep012
1590,garage I'll sacrifice that if I can keep,ep012
1593,glitter off the floors off the furniture,ep012
1596,yeah we wanted to move to Chattanooga to,ep012
1599,just give our family a different quality,ep012
1602,of life and this particular house I,ep012
1605,think will offer all of that to our,ep012
1608,family I like it so much more than I,ep012
1611,ever thought I would and there's a snow,ep012
1614,cone stand a year-round snow cone stand,ep012
1617,around the corner,ep012
1620,[Music],ep012
12,oh my gosh Don this is the coolest house,ep013
15,not exactly my style,ep013
18,these Maryland parents are poor Jenny,ep013
21,and JD have very different ideas of what,ep013
24,makes a house a home Don I don't see a,ep013
27,pool that's the weirdest table I've ever,ep013
30,seen but this is how he got him,ep013
33,downstairs,ep013
36,oh my god this crazy bar down there -,ep013
39,and finding a place with room for six is,ep013
42,going to take some compromise I mean,ep013
45,this is like a straight-up party house,ep013
48,the boys could fit in here okay the one,ep013
51,we like the least I guess,ep013
54,[Music],ep013
57,hey guys got room for two more all right,ep013
60,let's see it my name is JD I am an,ep013
63,investment advisor I'm Jenny,ep013
66,I'm a graphic designer and we live in,ep013
69,Salisbury Maryland the biggest draw of,ep013
72,Salisbury is we're close to the,ep013
75,Philadelphia is the Washington DC's the,ep013
78,Baltimore so a lot of people like to get,ep013
81,out of the rat race it's a good place to,ep013
84,raise family oK we've got four kids we,ep013
87,got a fourteen-year-old daughter named,ep013
90,Olivia and three boys Ethan his 12,ep013
93,Gavin his 10 and Brayden is 8 so I was I,ep013
96,was married before my first wife Jessica,ep013
99,and her sister were college roommates,ep013
102,married for about 15 years,ep013
105,Jessica she got cancer and in May of,ep013
108,2013 and of the passing in December of,ep013
111,2013 it wasn't real long after Jessica,ep013
114,passed away that the kids asked me that,ep013
117,you know dad when do you think you're,ep013
120,gonna start dating again it was evident,ep013
123,that there was definitely a a longing,ep013
126,for that mother figure so to speak in,ep013
129,their life we throw anything down,ep013
132,anything okay we reconnected JD had four,ep013
135,kids right I had to tell her that I had,ep013
138,eight kids so when she came out here and,ep013
141,saw that only had four it was like oh,ep013
144,that's no big deal he only has four kids,ep013
147,we're having food pork okay,ep013
150,stepping into this role of wife and,ep013
153,mother of four kids was exciting it felt,ep013
156,right and that was two and a half years,ep013
159,ago all right guys come get some get,ep013
162,your plates,ep013
165,yes so we live in the house the Jessica,ep013
168,not bought it's you know it fits our,ep013
171,needs it really does but with with Jenny,ep013
174,moving in it's it's one of these deals,ep013
177,where you know she's moving into mine,ep013
180,and Jessica's house so they're looking,ep013
183,to make a fresh start and buy a new home,ep013
186,is a new family so our budget will be in,ep013
189,"the 550 to $600,000 range a few guys you",ep013
192,know we're looking for new house don't,ep013
195,know what you guys we're looking for Oh,ep013
198,that'd be nice,ep013
201,ideally we are looking for six bedrooms,ep013
204,and at least four bathrooms,ep013
207,it sounds like an astronomical number a,ep013
210,lot of space so for me the kind of home,ep013
213,that I would dream to have would be a,ep013
216,mid-century style home I want something,ep013
219,that's unique just has to have that just,ep013
222,that different Flair fairly simple guy I,ep013
225,don't like wild crazy looking houses,ep013
228,just just regular old classic,ep013
231,traditional type home is what I would be,ep013
234,looking for my goal is to try to ease JD,ep013
237,into thinking a little differently,ep013
240,that's my plan for myself I would prefer,ep013
243,not to find a house that needed,ep013
246,renovations I'm not what you'd consider,ep013
249,handyman yeah and I'm opposite I really,ep013
252,actually want a project so what do you,ep013
255,guys think about a pool,ep013
258,[Music],ep013
261,you know dad doesn't want to I guess I,ep013
264,just think of all the the the,ep013
267,maintenance work that will be left on my,ep013
270,shoulders probably I like the idea of,ep013
273,having plenty of yard somewhere where I,ep013
276,can go out back and you know play ball,ep013
279,with the boys kayaks and clothes all,ep013
282,right well let's hope we can find,ep013
285,something that's near the water yes not,ep013
288,cheap for us in our situation obviously,ep013
291,this is gonna be a new chapter for us so,ep013
294,I think it'll be fun to to you know,ep013
297,write some new memories yeah I agree,ep013
300,this is about an acre of land here on,ep013
303,the Wicomico River they've reached out,ep013
306,to family friend and real estate agent,ep013
309,Don Bailey who's starting them off with,ep013
312,a contemporary option as you can see,ep013
315,it's the contemporary design that you,ep013
318,that you were like I love the geometric,ep013
321,window that is so beautiful,ep013
324,I love the privacy here that's very,ep013
327,secluded this is definitely win for,ep013
330,Jenni it's definitely not the,ep013
333,"traditional that I like it's about 3,100",ep013
336,square feet of living space we're coming,ep013
339,"from a house that has 3,700 square feet",ep013
342,probably gonna be a problem makes me,ep013
345,nervous there are three bedrooms but,ep013
348,there's two huge bonus rooms possibly,ep013
351,you could convert one of them into two,ep013
354,other bedrooms I like the potential and,ep013
357,the seller is asking five ninety five,ep013
360,five nine definitely nice Wow I like the,ep013
363,colors in here yeah this is very nice,ep013
366,and to our right is a TV room family,ep013
369,room I like the large window seat good,ep013
372,place to watch some football or to our,ep013
375,left here we have the open living and,ep013
378,dining area Don does the artwork come,ep013
381,with the house no the seller is an,ep013
384,artist I love this nice open room the,ep013
387,light is so beautiful it's a it's a nice,ep013
390,view no question I'm loving the,ep013
393,contemporary lines throughout the house,ep013
396,plenty of space in here we can get a,ep013
399,table in here for the whole family,ep013
402,let's take a look at the kitchen I like,ep013
405,it okay I like the countertops do you,ep013
408,think it's big enough I mean considering,ep013
411,the whole space I think it could work,ep013
414,yeah we've got access to it outside,ep013
417,porch Wow nice view I could see us,ep013
420,eating most of our dinners out here,ep013
423,during the summer sure Don I don't see a,ep013
426,pool,ep013
429,good job there's room for a pool I don't,ep013
432,think so,ep013
435,I'm a little bit disappointed with the,ep013
438,backyard there's really no space to play,ep013
441,ball with the kids I don't see a way,ep013
444,down to the water is there steps or a,ep013
447,dock back there one can be put in to the,ep013
450,right of the property line just off the,ep013
453,kitchen here we have the master I'm not,ep013
456,huge but that's okay shower marble,ep013
459,countertop well there's only one sink I,ep013
462,could picture me and JD fighting over,ep013
465,teeth or shaving off the bumpkin all the,ep013
468,way but I do like this geometric window,ep013
471,against repeating through the master,ep013
474,bathroom here okay at the end of the,ep013
477,hallway we have another bedroom yeah I,ep013
480,bet this would be great for Olivia and,ep013
483,have full baths yes it'll be a better,ep013
486,learn to like this shade of pink,ep013
489,upstairs we have the two bonus rooms,ep013
492,almost talking to you about I could see,ep013
495,this being my office yeah this is really,ep013
498,neat wow this is a first-class art,ep013
501,studio yeah this is neat yeah this could,ep013
504,definitely be a kid's game room all,ep013
507,right and over here we have a full bath,ep013
510,okay and look at this bedroom this would,ep013
513,be a good bedroom mm-hmm oh this is the,ep013
516,second bonus room,ep013
519,Wow this is huge you could easily put,ep013
522,some walls up here make this a couple,ep013
525,bedrooms if you wanted to right this is,ep013
528,a kid's dream up here this would be,ep013
531,great all right I want to show you this,ep013
534,the first owner was an artist also and,ep013
537,he did a lot of paintings like four by,ep013
540,six canvases this is how he got,ep013
543,downstairs oh that's crazy,ep013
546,Wow I can see the boys like when he,ep013
549,could jump off this I'll have to put a,ep013
552,nut down there yes,ep013
555,there's your quirkiness,ep013
558,Don I seriously think you found what the,ep013
561,coolest houses it was amazing I love the,ep013
564,geometric windows the vaulted ceilings,ep013
567,it wasn't a traditional that I liked out,ep013
570,front when I got inside I was very,ep013
573,pleasantly surprised I think we can we,ep013
576,could make it work if we had some some,ep013
579,walls up there for the kids to make our,ep013
582,extra bedroom you know I wish we had,ep013
585,some more space in the backyard it is,ep013
588,still at the high end of our price range,ep013
591,so Don's found them a house with a price,ep013
594,tag that's easier to swallow but there's,ep013
597,always a trade-off oh no Don I'm not,ep013
600,really digging this road a lot of,ep013
603,traffic out here,ep013
606,[Music],ep013
609,alright guys game of soccer it's gonna,ep013
612,be me Gavin and Ethan first mom Olivia,ep013
615,and Braden wanting a fresh start as a,ep013
618,new family Salisbury Maryland couple JD,ep013
621,and Jenny and their four kids are,ep013
624,looking for a home they can call their,ep013
627,own Jenny was charmed by a contemporary,ep013
630,home with space for a potential pool but,ep013
633,it's at the top of their budget and,ep013
636,doesn't have a yard for JD today they're,ep013
639,headed to see a more traditional option,ep013
642,oh no no I'm not really digging this,ep013
645,road a lot of traffic out here well what,ep013
648,you're gonna really like is the back,ep013
651,great backyard for the kids to play in,ep013
654,okay I do like the front of this house a,ep013
657,lot more traditional actually reminds me,ep013
660,the house I grew up there yeah it's not,ep013
663,a mid-century home but Jeanne likes it I,ep013
666,think I could check it out oh yeah hi,ep013
669,"good we've got over 4,500 square feet",ep013
672,okay on the main levels we have four,ep013
675,bedrooms four and a half bathrooms,ep013
678,couple flex rooms they could be,ep013
681,converted wow that's big what's the,ep013
684,what's the price what would this set us,ep013
687,back this is only 549 okay that's not,ep013
690,bad at all okay living room here a,ep013
693,little bit on the traditional side now,ep013
696,to the right here we have a,ep013
699,jack-and-jill bedroom of the biggest,ep013
702,room I've ever seen but the one we like,ep013
705,the least is left there's a bathroom all,ep013
708,right,ep013
711,this is pretty I like the clawfoot tub,ep013
714,that's really really cute and second,ep013
717,bedroom second bedroom all right about,ep013
720,the same size as the first one and then,ep013
723,the formal dining room this is a big,ep013
726,area it's nice crown molding up here,ep013
729,again it's on the traditional side might,ep013
732,need to spice it up a bit and put a cool,ep013
735,chandelier in here and maybe a really,ep013
738,sleek table,ep013
741,this is huge gosh done this is like an,ep013
744,auditorium in here I can hear my echo I,ep013
747,love it this this seems like a great,ep013
750,entertaining space sure nice windows,ep013
753,looking out to the river that's great I,ep013
756,love that Wow,ep013
759,love this breeze off the water but Don I,ep013
762,don't see my pool I see one right here I,ep013
765,definitely think there's some potential,ep013
768,back here all right let's go into the,ep013
771,gourmet kitchen it's nice but way too,ep013
774,small,ep013
777,well I mean I like this kitchen though,ep013
780,the way it just has a lot of character,ep013
783,and this range is incredible,ep013
786,all right Jenny turn right okay this is,ep013
789,be the 2 flex areas I was talking about,ep013
792,well ceilings are a bit low I just grew,ep013
795,when is it until you're right it's a,ep013
798,full bath okay hmm not a bad size I,ep013
801,guess the idea here is this could be a,ep013
804,bedroom sure okay have to be for someone,ep013
807,pretty short yeah and then we've got,ep013
810,like an apartment full bedroom bathroom,ep013
813,kitchen Wow,ep013
816,this is like a whole nother house down,ep013
819,here I could see as the kids get into,ep013
822,high school they love it down here,ep013
825,bedrooms to our left good this is nice I,ep013
828,like the high ceilings in here maybe,ep013
831,this could be a good space for Olivia,ep013
834,yeah there's definitely enough space I,ep013
837,think we just have to figure out who,ep013
840,would go where the bedroom situation is,ep013
843,kind of strange I mean there's three,ep013
846,different levels of bedrooms but I mean,ep013
849,there's so many different options that,ep013
852,I'd have to just sit down and go through,ep013
855,the plans and just see if it could work,ep013
858,for us all right you got your private,ep013
861,staircase leading here to the large,ep013
864,master pshh this is gigantic yeah I mean,ep013
867,I don't know if we really need this much,ep013
870,space for the master bedroom Wow Don,ep013
873,this is a lot bigger much bigger I mean,ep013
876,there's a lot of traditional fixtures in,ep013
879,here but the countertops are really nice,ep013
882,the space itself is pretty cool,ep013
885,but for me I I liked it you know it's,ep013
888,definitely I'm more in the traditional,ep013
891,which I like love the views out here,ep013
894,they're gorgeous,ep013
897,yeah I mean the square footage is a nice,ep013
900,size I think for amount of people we,ep013
903,have in our family I think I could do,ep013
906,some things with this house you know,ep013
909,change out the furniture add some more,ep013
912,modern elements but I'm really looking,ep013
915,for that mid-century look though Don's,ep013
918,found a home he thinks Jenny a love but,ep013
921,it's not for everyone do what I warn you,ep013
924,it's a fixer-upper all right well that,ep013
927,doesn't make me real happy,ep013
930,[Music],ep013
933,what do you think Jenny we finally got,ep013
936,some Sun out I never knew kids what,ep013
939,we're gonna do,ep013
942,JD Jenny and their four kids are,ep013
945,searching for a house to make new,ep013
948,memories in as a family in Salisbury,ep013
951,Maryland,ep013
954,Jenny's I was caught by a quirky,ep013
957,contemporary home with space to build a,ep013
960,pool but it would put them at the top of,ep013
963,their budget and it lacks any,ep013
966,traditional details for JD JD is partial,ep013
969,to a spacious traditional house with,ep013
972,enough yard space for their kids to play,ep013
975,but jenny is hoping for something that,ep013
978,feels a bit more unique their,ep013
981,real-estate agent Don has another option,ep013
984,to show them but it's a real fixer-upper,ep013
987,I'm really taking a gamble here this is,ep013
990,a unique property not for everyone this,ep013
993,is the coolest house I mean the modern,ep013
996,lines it looks like a mid-century home,ep013
999,yeah not not exactly my style not a good,ep013
1002,first impression on the house at all,ep013
1005,there's no elements whatsoever of,ep013
1008,"traditional there's over 5,000 square",ep013
1011,feet okay that's good,ep013
1014,five bedrooms five and a half baths no,ep013
1017,way I do what a Warren yeah it is a,ep013
1020,fixer-upper all right well that doesn't,ep013
1023,make me real happy I like the idea of,ep013
1026,move-in and it's priced right at 349 349,ep013
1029,okay most spectacular interest but I,ep013
1032,don't mind the honeycomb tile floor it's,ep013
1035,a nice touch,ep013
1038,behind the closet here is the dining,ep013
1041,room all right it's not that big she's a,ep013
1044,little bit enclosed or something but but,ep013
1047,I do like the vaulted ceilings,ep013
1050,it's nice kind of low right here but,ep013
1053,yeah I like the ceilings over here not,ep013
1056,so much right here okay guys let's walk,ep013
1059,downstairs and look at the office huh,ep013
1062,there's a full bath to your left,ep013
1065,it's unique pretty small,ep013
1068,that's the weirdest tub I've ever seen,ep013
1071,but I did ask for quirky and here's the,ep013
1074,office Oh sound like this this could be,ep013
1077,a good office all right let's step into,ep013
1080,the sunken living room I love this room,ep013
1083,this is exactly what I was looking for,ep013
1086,all these windows you see this great,ep013
1089,view outside it's beautiful I like this,ep013
1092,this is neat little fireplace here yeah,ep013
1095,it's like a ripened avocado let's step,ep013
1098,out on the porch sure okay,ep013
1101,well there's my pool it looks a little,ep013
1104,rundown we see where some of the,ep013
1107,renovation budgets gonna have to go - I,ep013
1110,don't see a backyard out here what am I,ep013
1113,missing something here JD that's my,ep013
1116,backyard kids don't need a backyard and,ep013
1119,they got a front yard at least we know,ep013
1122,where we can sit a rope and there so,ep013
1125,he's good creative yeah I wish there was,ep013
1128,more of a backyard but well where do we,ep013
1131,start this is pretty bad it has to be,ep013
1134,completely gutted yeah,ep013
1137,3:49 all right let's take a look over,ep013
1140,here this extra large family room Wow,ep013
1143,Danya keep delivering with the unusual,ep013
1146,like straight out of the 70s but I love,ep013
1149,it I mean this is like a straight-up,ep013
1152,party house seeing this house and all,ep013
1155,the renovations that it needs it makes,ep013
1158,me feel really excited I feel the wheels,ep013
1161,turning in my mind all right to the left,ep013
1164,is a large game room okay is large this,ep013
1167,is cool,ep013
1170,it feels like you're like on a ship or,ep013
1173,something oh well you got four bedrooms,ep013
1176,including the master three full bath on,ep013
1179,the second level here okay,ep013
1182,and we've got the master suite the,ep013
1185,master bath is on your right okay this,ep013
1188,is small for such like a big house this,ep013
1191,seems like a very unexcited master,ep013
1194,bathroom closets here in the master well,ep013
1197,well yeah I'm not impressed so we've,ep013
1200,seen four bedrooms so far man she said,ep013
1203,there was five yes the fifth one is on,ep013
1206,the basement level okay,ep013
1209,[Music],ep013
1212,that was quite an overwhelming house I,ep013
1215,mean it was huge yes definitely has the,ep013
1218,square footage Ernie it has that,ep013
1221,mid-century feel I'm looking for I love,ep013
1224,the back deck there we can look out on,ep013
1227,the lake you know definitely not my,ep013
1230,style I'm a little nervous with that,ep013
1233,much construction that needs to be done,ep013
1236,we got four kids it's a huge undertaking,ep013
1239,yeah I mean this is a big decision with,ep013
1242,two very different aesthetics it's time,ep013
1245,for Jenni and JD to see if they can,ep013
1248,agree on which house to call home it may,ep013
1251,come down to a choice between yard and,ep013
1254,style this is a huge huge decision I,ep013
1257,mean I don't know what we're gonna do,ep013
1260,[Music],ep013
1263,[Applause],ep013
1266,salisbury maryland couple Jenny and JD,ep013
1269,"have a budget of $600,000 and two very",ep013
1272,different ideas of what their next house,ep013
1275,should look like with several options on,ep013
1278,the table it's time to see if they can,ep013
1281,agree on one so what do you think about,ep013
1284,the contemporary it was for 595 it was,ep013
1287,so cool I mean I love those geometric,ep013
1290,windows and that really crazy door that,ep013
1293,opens to nowhere while the house maybe,ep013
1296,wasn't exactly my style from the outside,ep013
1299,you know it wasn't bad on the negative,ep013
1302,side there's not even as much square,ep013
1305,footage as we currently have yeah I,ep013
1308,really had no yard out there which was,ep013
1311,sort of disappointing to me I mean,ep013
1314,obviously it's the top of our price,ep013
1317,range but maybe in a year or two we,ep013
1320,could think about putting a pool so what,ep013
1323,do you think about that craftsman on the,ep013
1326,river for 5:49 you know from the outside,ep013
1329,it's a little bit more my style the more,ep013
1332,traditional I like that of all the,ep013
1335,houses it's probably had the best yard,ep013
1338,the kitchen I love the aesthetics of it,ep013
1341,but it is still pretty small it was tiny,ep013
1344,so that great room with all like the,ep013
1347,high ceilings and everything I mean that,ep013
1350,was a really pretty room but the rest of,ep013
1353,the house is hard because it's very,ep013
1356,traditional and that's just like that's,ep013
1359,not my style at all well what about that,ep013
1362,mid-century modern I mean I know that's,ep013
1365,definitely your style,ep013
1368,that's for 3:49 man that house has so,ep013
1371,many different things going on with it,ep013
1374,it did not have any yard whatsoever,ep013
1377,I mean it's massive it really is but it,ep013
1380,has those modern lines there's,ep013
1383,mid-century details that I was really,ep013
1386,looking for I mean it's it's a big,ep013
1389,renovation job though I mean that's I'm,ep013
1392,not sure we're ready for all that it,ep013
1395,could put a lot of stress on our family,ep013
1398,I haven't been able to sleep just kind,ep013
1401,of think of all these homes and what's,ep013
1404,the best house for us,ep013
1407,I don't know what we're gonna do yeah,ep013
1410,you do the only house that we have the,ep013
1413,budget to change things as the,ep013
1416,mid-century home I mean that place could,ep013
1419,really be a showstopper I'm okay with,ep013
1422,the mid-century modern if you are I,ep013
1425,think you could really put your stamp on,ep013
1428,this house and make it a home for us I,ep013
1431,think the kids are gonna love it hey,ep013
1434,guys so we closed in the house two weeks,ep013
1437,ago and this is why we're we're not,ep013
1440,living in here yet we've got months and,ep013
1443,months of renovations ahead of us we're,ep013
1446,gonna just gut it all right so the house,ep013
1449,is listed for 349 but after the,ep013
1452,inspections we're able to get some,ep013
1455,concessions from the seller Aiona find,ep013
1458,the house for 315 which is good I think,ep013
1461,we're gonna need every dollar that for,ep013
1464,the renovations so rate what we're,ep013
1467,standing right now is where your new,ep013
1470,sinks gonna be and then we're gonna have,ep013
1473,your large island here first off the,ep013
1476,kitchen we're gonna flip the whole thing,ep013
1479,around we're gonna face out to the,ep013
1482,little lake we're gonna take up some of,ep013
1485,the old playroom space because there's,ep013
1488,so many different spaces throughout this,ep013
1491,house we're gonna create a master suite,ep013
1494,there I think this is really changing,ep013
1497,the whole flow of the house all right,ep013
1500,guys,ep013
1503,check out the pool the boys are crazy,ep013
1506,about the water in the back they already,ep013
1509,went in canoes and kayaks all right,ep013
1512,who's gonna be the first one to go in we,ep013
1515,could have some boats out here look,ep013
1518,there's a little tie offs on these docks,ep013
1521,so you guys like it or what yeah,ep013
1524,yeah I'm really really excited about my,ep013
1527,big expansive backyard oh wait now I,ep013
1530,don't have a backyard do i you're just,ep013
1533,there zero yeah unfortunately it was,ep013
1536,hell JD you had to be the compromise I,ep013
1539,think I took the brunt of the,ep013
1542,compromising you know I guess I feel,ep013
1545,like with Jenny you know coming here and,ep013
1548,taking on four kids and such with our,ep013
1551,situation that you know she deserved to,ep013
1554,be the one who had a little bit more the,ep013
1557,say in terms of her style and her,ep013
1560,preferences a really big deal moving and,ep013
1563,changing your life this whole house,ep013
1566,anything is very emotional it's you know,ep013
1569,it's a lot of stuff you have to consider,ep013
1572,and I mean the fact that JD took the,ep013
1575,time to really open up his mind you know,ep013
1578,it's just really it means so much to me,ep013
1581,I'm just excited that we can build some,ep013
1584,new memories together and just you know,ep013
1587,build a life here it's gonna be great,ep013

24,mom their real-estate agent okay and,ep014
27,that dream house for Kim needs the,ep014
30,perfect shaped kitchen island this is,ep014
33,what I'm talking about this is exactly,ep014
36,what I wanted look at this you have the,ep014
39,perfect rectangular island the shape is,ep014
42,awkward it's that weird triangular shape,ep014
45,of Sunland Island and then there's,ep014
48,another space to consider I like to call,ep014
51,it the diva damn I already know the,ep014
54,chandelier I want to get four right,ep014
57,there maybe a little rug lock on the,ep014
60,door to keep you guys out know how to,ep014
63,pick that lock,ep014
66,[Music],ep014
69,so let's see so what's the obviously,ep014
72,using right now my name is Nick and I'm,ep014
75,a Senior Account Manager for a telecom,ep014
78,company my name is Kim I'm a registered,ep014
81,nurse in the emergency department we've,ep014
84,been married for 18 years what I love,ep014
87,most about Nick is he's a funny person,ep014
90,he's got a great sense of humor he's,ep014
93,definitely more outgoing to me but he's,ep014
96,a little spontaneous immature I think,ep014
99,but I'm more serious I'm more of a,ep014
102,control freak in our relationship she,ep014
105,makes sure everything is taken care of,ep014
108,which is a complete Rock and I keep it,ep014
111,from going over the top we even each,ep014
114,other out know what I think Barbie,ep014
117,basketball because I couldn't find the,ep014
120,soccer ball today and the kids want to,ep014
123,play soccer we have two children,ep014
126,London is nine McKenna's five for the,ep014
129,last 20 years they've called the San,ep014
132,Francisco area home but just recently,ep014
135,Nick received a job offer in Southern,ep014
138,California a part of the state they've,ep014
141,actually considered moving to four years,ep014
144,I love Southern California he always,ep014
147,wanted to move I was like let's just do,ep014
150,it let's do it now we love the lifestyle,ep014
153,we like the people we like the Sun and,ep014
156,also it's not as pricy so I think it's a,ep014
159,good move for our family so now these,ep014
162,first-time buyers are looking for a,ep014
165,house in the Temecula Valley located,ep014
168,about an hour northeast of San Diego the,ep014
171,area is known for its scenic wineries,ep014
174,and vineyards so relaxing this is,ep014
177,exactly why we want to move it's just a,ep014
180,slower more simple pace of life and with,ep014
183,Nick already living in Temecula to start,ep014
186,work and the rest of the family in town,ep014
189,for a visit they're excited to get going,ep014
192,on their hunt our price range we're,ep014
195,looking to spend is around 450 thousand,ep014
198,I would like the option of working off,ep014
201,one income if I didn't want to work or,ep014
204,if needed I like this house here except,ep014
207,that it's a 2-story which is perfect I,ep014
210,think having a two-story spanish-style,ep014
213,house I loved the way it looks and the,ep014
216,colors and and the outside it makes me,ep014
219,feel like I'm on vacation eat one of my,ep014
222,home I would prefer a ranch-style house,ep014
225,vacations nice but we have to live and,ep014
228,ranch-style single-story we're all kind,ep014
231,of near each other,ep014
234,let's homey and comfortable,ep014
237,she's also open to a Craftsman bungalow,ep014
240,and when it comes to the outside I would,ep014
243,really love to have a pool for our kids,ep014
246,to be over and swimming and have their,ep014
249,friends over I had to pull my,ep014
252,grandmother's house I was growing up and,ep014
255,it was so nice to just go jump in you're,ep014
258,gonna people over and swim and play I,ep014
261,think she's gonna love clean in that,ep014
264,pool to watch it and putting the,ep014
267,chemicals in the pool I think it'd be,ep014
270,great,ep014
273,I see energy effort and money he does,ep014
276,want a three-car garage however they,ep014
279,both really like a large ensuite bath,ep014
282,with a separate water closet and Kim has,ep014
285,a specific vision for the kitchen I,ep014
288,would love love love to have a white,ep014
291,kitchen with dark granite and I would,ep014
294,like to have a rectangular island,ep014
297,because that's the only shape I like on,ep014
300,the island you in this island I don't,ep014
303,want to lose a house because the island,ep014
306,is not the right shape we've had a,ep014
309,triangular-shaped island I hated that,ep014
312,there was no space to work with it was,ep014
315,cramped if people were there for a party,ep014
318,there was nowhere to get around no,ep014
321,they're looking for at least four,ep014
324,bedrooms giving them a guest room and a,ep014
327,bonus would be a space for Kim to call,ep014
330,all her own I like to call it the D but,ep014
333,damn,ep014
336,and she's not she's not a diva but she,ep014
339,never puts herself first and I think,ep014
342,it's time for her to have her own space,ep014
345,we'd never asked for a diva den but if,ep014
348,he wants to give me one I'm okay with,ep014
351,that,ep014
354,I want to have a chandelier I want to,ep014
357,have my shoes and my purse as my makeup,ep014
360,be a little couch or a chair and a nice,ep014
363,rug and I love to just build a sitting,ep014
366,put my makeup on quietly and helping,ep014
369,them find all of these things in just,ep014
372,one house this Bay area-based,ep014
375,real-estate agent Nick's mom you are,ep014
378,gonna miss your babies aren't you what,ep014
381,are you gonna do with these girls I,ep014
384,don't know so you don't miss them just,ep014
387,invited me a house yes I'm still finding,ep014
390,a house right and how about you you near,ep014
393,us let's find you a place you can find,ep014
396,those for so Cynthia gets going on,ep014
399,trying to find them their new home in,ep014
402,Temecula I'm emotional about it because,ep014
405,it's where my grandchildren will live I,ep014
408,want them to be happy,ep014
411,wherever they are and so it's gonna take,ep014
414,a little bit of a balancing not to,ep014
417,become personally involved in their,ep014
420,decision making but to still do my job,ep014
423,as a real estate agent I already love it,ep014
426,it's a ranch-style single-story for me I,ep014
429,love that you know I'm not in a ranch,ep014
432,guy but I'll do like the Spanish looks I,ep014
435,do think that's great,ep014
438,three-car garage I love that,ep014
441,"under budget okay at $420,000 I like",ep014
444,that that's good this is perfect I think,ep014
447,it's beautiful and I think I'm really,ep014
450,gonna like it oh wow I love all the,ep014
453,light in here and the floors aren't bad,ep014
456,here these are laminate though aren't,ep014
459,they,ep014
462,yes they are they're not real wood,ep014
465,floors but they look very nice at least,ep014
468,space is a really good size that's,ep014
471,actually pretty big but I don't like,ep014
474,this countertop at all,ep014
477,yeah the shape is awkward it's that,ep014
480,weird triangular shape it's not really,ep014
483,an island I think that this is a perfect,ep014
486,kitchen for you there is lots of storage,ep014
489,space yeah and this actually is not that,ep014
492,big a deal you can take this out and put,ep014
495,an island and that's perfect for you,ep014
498,okay I mean that's a good thought,ep014
501,estimate the cabinet's look like they're,ep014
504,in really good shape if we could paint,ep014
507,them white yeah I do want a white,ep014
510,kitchen yeah yeah I think that's a great,ep014
513,idea it's gonna cost us a little bit of,ep014
516,money but I think it could work but,ep014
519,we're under budget still too oh wow I,ep014
522,love this perfect for the girls yeah,ep014
525,they would be swimming all day and I'll,ep014
528,be cleaning it all day and look at this,ep014
531,beautiful pond with the fountain that's,ep014
534,gorgeous look at all the trees that are,ep014
537,already growing I love that yeah I know,ep014
540,but I can imagine all these leaves in,ep014
543,that pool no Nick's going on on about,ep014
546,the maintenance of things but I think he,ep014
549,would love it because it is like an,ep014
552,oasis it's like a vacation in your,ep014
555,backyard no now don't tell Kim but that,ep014
558,pool was a nice pool I mean I can see,ep014
561,myself relaxed out there there's still,ep014
564,work involved but that pool I mean I was,ep014
567,a bad pool back inside they look in on,ep014
570,what would be the two kids rooms and a,ep014
573,bath before taking a look at the,ep014
576,potential guest room or do,ep014
579,it seems a little small like how do you,ep014
582,put a better manner well keep in mind,ep014
585,that there's a lot of furniture in this,ep014
588,room you use this for a deeper den my,ep014
591,tinder front I don't know if I want it,ep014
594,right when people walk in yeah it,ep014
597,doesn't seem great right I want to have,ep014
600,I won't have a guest room yeah like you,ep014
603,said I'm not really sure how you'd fit a,ep014
606,bed in here yeah yeah but it's here so,ep014
609,we have the fourth room we'd have to,ep014
612,just kind of figure out yeah they head,ep014
615,down the hallway and take a look at the,ep014
618,master suite this master bedroom is,ep014
621,amazing this is big and I like how the,ep014
624,master bathroom is attached to it but I,ep014
627,do want the carpet pulled up out of the,ep014
630,bathroom I don't like that yeah that's,ep014
633,weird,ep014
636,but look at the closet oh wow that's a,ep014
639,big closet yeah this big oh wow we get,ep014
642,all of our stuff in here it's got the,ep014
645,room for the toilet which is good too,ep014
648,it's separate yeah yeah it's a ranch,ep014
651,yeah that's a pool so pretty much you,ep014
654,found her perfect house what about me,ep014
657,very good choice single story I love,ep014
660,that backyard love the pool the privacy,ep014
663,in the back is amazing I think you know,ep014
666,there is some things we have to do I,ep014
669,don't like the island thing in the,ep014
672,kitchen we'd have to do something there,ep014
675,come it comes well under budget that's,ep014
678,true there's a lot of no money to we,ep014
681,could do things like we could get your,ep014
684,stuff done before you even move in big,ep014
687,big plus there that fourth room that,ep014
690,doesn't have a name like you'll use it,ep014
693,for your diamond damage I don't think,ep014
696,you want to we can't use it for a,ep014
699,bedroom that's a good point yeah there's,ep014
702,so many parts I really like and the,ep014
705,bones of this house is amazing I mean I,ep014
708,can see what you can do with it okay,ep014
711,but since Nick has his heart set on a,ep014
714,two-story his mom lines one up for him,ep014
717,but there may be a problem so this,ep014
720,"property was listed at $459,000",ep014
723,I know it's a little over the budget,ep014
726,[Music],ep014
729,this family is moving to California's,ep014
732,Temecula Valley mix mom a real estate,ep014
735,agent in helping them find the perfect,ep014
738,house within their four hundred and,ep014
741,fifty thousand dollar budget so far,ep014
744,they've seen a ranch for four hundred,ep014
747,and twenty thousand dollars that was,ep014
750,Kim's style but may not offer her own,ep014
753,diva den and still have a separate room,ep014
756,for guests it also wasn't the two-story,ep014
759,house Nick really wants so today they're,ep014
762,having a look at a home that hopefully,ep014
765,combines elements they'll both like this,ep014
768,"property was listed at $459,000 I know",ep014
771,it's a little over the budget but it was,ep014
774,"just recently lowered $14,000",ep014
777,so it's 4:45 it's still within our,ep014
780,budget so it works right and Kim if,ep014
783,you'll notice it has some of the,ep014
786,Craftsman features that you would that,ep014
789,you like I love the rock pillars in the,ep014
792,front I think that's really pretty it's,ep014
795,not Spanish yeah but it's nice I like,ep014
798,the colors I third car garage you know I,ep014
801,like that,ep014
804,ya know this is nice this looks good so,ep014
807,far Wow,ep014
810,I love how big the space is right here,ep014
813,yeah this is a big space I can't help,ep014
816,but notice that neon green and then like,ep014
819,that blue paint up there don't worry,ep014
822,about that it's an easy fix,ep014
825,what's with the floors over here oh they,ep014
828,have a different Sun over here I wonder,ep014
831,why they did that I think they used to,ep014
834,be carpet in this room okay and it was,ep014
837,updated yeah just a different color Wow,ep014
840,this and there's your kitchen is not,ep014
843,what I expected from this kitchen mm-hmm,ep014
846,I know the the cabinets are not white,ep014
849,but we can paint those but this is this,ep014
852,is the island is awkward and I really,ep014
855,wanted a granite on top so we'd have to,ep014
858,put that in which is gonna be expensive,ep014
861,yeah adding up these costs and paint,ep014
864,once again I've seen 12 colors of paint,ep014
867,me too I know you're gonna come and help,ep014
870,me paint but this could be a lot of pain,ep014
873,that's gonna be expensive but keep in,ep014
876,mind you don't have to do all the,ep014
879,painting at once that's true I do like,ep014
882,how it flows though it does flow that's,ep014
885,how the hardwood floors go,ep014
888,way through yeah and then we can go look,ep014
891,at my pool let's go look at you yeah,ep014
894,that's what I wanted I love it this is,ep014
897,awesome the kids would love playing out,ep014
900,here also if you notice this is a sport,ep014
903,pool so it doesn't get above five feet,ep014
906,it's a safety feature for the girls,ep014
909,that's perfect yeah I'm not a pool guy,ep014
912,but this is actually I mean it's nice,ep014
915,but it's not know if I like the fact,ep014
918,that you wouldn't be able to have any,ep014
921,shade out here I think that'd be tough I,ep014
924,think you could build a pergola that's a,ep014
927,good idea,ep014
930,could you see me building a pergola out,ep014
933,here no actually you've never built,ep014
936,anything back inside they take a look at,ep014
939,a downstairs bedroom that could be a,ep014
942,possible guest room okay they make their,ep014
945,way upstairs and see two bedrooms and a,ep014
948,bath for the girls before heading to the,ep014
951,master suite oh yeah this is guy like,ep014
954,this I love the windows it's huge like I,ep014
957,like all the light coming into the,ep014
960,bathroom that's nice everything needs to,ep014
963,be redone in here yeah everything done,ep014
966,but the size is a great yeah oh no oh my,ep014
969,goodness check out this closet and the,ep014
972,closet it's huge,ep014
975,Wow this is like a whole nother room I,ep014
978,love it,ep014
981,yeah though that's a saving grace I love,ep014
984,it I like that and I like this it's a 24,ep014
987,so that's good that's true we could,ep014
990,definitely work with this space I love,ep014
993,having a pool I really that was at the,ep014
996,top of my list yeah want the girls to be,ep014
999,able to swim at home and I could watch,ep014
1002,them they can have their friends over I,ep014
1005,also see painting the entire house,ep014
1008,I see putting floors and half this house,ep014
1011,because there's 10 different kinds of,ep014
1014,floors the kitchen there's things in the,ep014
1017,kitchen I want to do too yeah,ep014
1020,we don't have room for your game again,ep014
1023,no maybe part of that that closets,ep014
1026,really big we could put a lot of mine,ep014
1029,things in there we just have to I think,ep014
1032,figured out what the price I think that,ep014
1035,you know the house has been on the,ep014
1038,market for over 50 days I really think,ep014
1041,that we can make an offer on this,ep014
1044,property that's much less than what,ep014
1047,they're asking for okay so I can pay,ep014
1050,someone to build that burglar yes,ep014
1053,now with Nick's mom called back to the,ep014
1056,Bay Area the listing agent is showing,ep014
1059,them this next place this spanish-style,ep014
1062,it is true story but I don't see my,ep014
1065,third car garage and we can be this,ep014
1068,close to beautiful places like this they,ep014
1071,call that winning oh I agree with you I,ep014
1074,can't wait I'm so excited to move cam,ep014
1077,and Nick are moving from the San,ep014
1080,Francisco area to the Temecula Valley,ep014
1083,with four hundred and fifty thousand,ep014
1086,dollars to spend they've already seen a,ep014
1089,ranch her preferred style with Spanish,ep014
1092,touches for him it was listed for four,ep014
1095,hundred and twenty thousand dollars and,ep014
1098,had her pool and his three car garage,ep014
1101,then they saw a two-story craftsman,ep014
1104,listed for four hundred and forty five,ep014
1107,thousand dollars it too had a pool and a,ep014
1110,three-car garage but neither home,ep014
1113,offered a defined space for Kim's diva,ep014
1116,dead,ep014
1119,and since Nick's mom had to go back to,ep014
1122,the Bay Area she's arranged for the,ep014
1125,listing agent to show them another house,ep014
1128,so what is spanish-style it is true,ep014
1131,story but I don't see Micah third car,ep014
1134,garage it doesn't have a three-car,ep014
1137,garage it does have some extra parking,ep014
1140,"here and it's listed at $385,000",ep014
1143,Association $179 a month that's another,ep014
1146,another cost but the house is so cheap,ep014
1149,that's not a really nice neighborhood,ep014
1152,it's a nice community you've got several,ep014
1155,pools it's really isn't my style it's,ep014
1158,not a ranch-style at all but the price,ep014
1161,point is amazing so I'm willing to give,ep014
1164,it a shot oh wow oh babe I love these,ep014
1167,floors,ep014
1170,well these are nice okay I want to see,ep014
1173,my kitchen okay oh this is what I'm,ep014
1176,talking about this is exactly what I,ep014
1179,wanted it has the white cabinets it has,ep014
1182,the dark granite look at this you have,ep014
1185,the perfect rectangular island there's,ep014
1188,areas for the girls in the stools they,ep014
1191,can be there while I'm cooking there's,ep014
1194,plenty of space look how open this is,ep014
1197,but this is not perfect rectangle that's,ep014
1200,what you said but if it was a perfect,ep014
1203,rectangle we wouldn't have this nice,ep014
1206,spot for all these barstools for you and,ep014
1209,the two girls that you have now and yeah,ep014
1212,all those children that you're gonna be,ep014
1215,adding,ep014
1218,[Laughter],ep014
1221,[Music],ep014
1224,it needs a little bit more done back,ep014
1227,here I think we would have to put some,ep014
1230,type of covering it's really hot back,ep014
1233,here and there's no shade if we want to,ep014
1236,we could put a pool and there's a lot of,ep014
1239,space back here,ep014
1242,hey we're paying HOAs we're gonna use to,ep014
1245,pull this out here the nice thing about,ep014
1248,that is with this house being under your,ep014
1251,guys's budget you you have some wiggle,ep014
1254,room with the price where you have some,ep014
1257,money that you could throw around it,ep014
1260,things like an awning okay well we're,ep014
1263,just kind of making the backyard your,ep014
1266,own the price of the house is great it's,ep014
1269,below our budget that's great,ep014
1272,but now you start adding home,ep014
1275,association fees doing some landscaping,ep014
1278,these things all start to add up and now,ep014
1281,we're gonna push ourselves out of our,ep014
1284,range,ep014
1287,they head back inside and see a,ep014
1290,downstairs bedroom and they have their,ep014
1293,own space they had upstairs and peek in,ep014
1296,on two bedrooms for the girls and a bath,ep014
1299,before taking a look at a possible space,ep014
1302,for Kim's Steve a dad already knows,ep014
1305,chandelier I want to get four right,ep014
1308,there maybe a little rug lock on the,ep014
1311,door to keep you guys out daughters know,ep014
1314,how to pick that lock but this would be,ep014
1317,perfect I think farther down the hall is,ep014
1320,the master suite,ep014
1323,it could work it could work what do we,ep014
1326,have here oh this is the master bath,ep014
1329,this looks really small oh my sure is,ep014
1332,this is not really a master bathroom,ep014
1335,thank you don't like how there's not a,ep014
1338,room for this I think you need to have,ep014
1341,your own space I can see what you mean,ep014
1344,with that,ep014
1347,yeah Spanish style I think the two-story,ep014
1350,I like the area there are a lot of good,ep014
1353,things for this house and not so good,ep014
1356,things too it's really wasn't the style,ep014
1359,I wanted it's not the ranch I wanted it,ep014
1362,doesn't have a cozy feel the only thing,ep014
1365,that really was on my list was the white,ep014
1368,kitchen I love this yeah I love the,ep014
1371,granite,ep014
1374,I love the rectangular islands I love,ep014
1377,there's space for my diva den yeah,ep014
1380,that's nice bathrooms are kind of small,ep014
1383,so that's a problem yard is gonna be,ep014
1386,expensive to put together what we want,ep014
1389,if you want to put a pool in or,ep014
1392,Landscaping but there are pools included,ep014
1395,with the HOA to consider the price is,ep014
1398,really good yeah but you know one other,ep014
1401,thing was missing my three-car garage we,ep014
1404,don't have a lot of storage here so,ep014
1407,that's another drawback with all the,ep014
1410,homes coming in below budget they'll,ep014
1413,have to decide what the bigger drawbacks,ep014
1416,actually are not having a private pool,ep014
1419,no dividend we're missing the big garage,ep014
1422,all right babe this is it we gotta make,ep014
1425,a decision we gotta make a decision yeah,ep014
1428,I want this one all right with a four,ep014
1431,hundred and fifty thousand dollar budget,ep014
1434,Nick and camera in the market for a,ep014
1437,large family home in California's,ep014
1440,Temecula Valley they've seen their,ep014
1443,options and now they have to decide the,ep014
1446,Spanish ranch,ep014
1449,yeah it was 420 I loved that house I,ep014
1452,know,ep014
1455,okay the price was right love the curb,ep014
1458,appeal that backyard was amazing with,ep014
1461,the pool it is beautiful back there even,ep014
1464,I have to admit that that was paradise,ep014
1467,what would you think about that we're,ep014
1470,affordable yeah I don't know if it would,ep014
1473,work for your diva Dan I don't think I,ep014
1476,worked for a guestroom though either but,ep014
1479,it's like a weird shape but master,ep014
1482,bedroom it was huge,ep014
1485,I love that yeah yeah I like that too so,ep014
1488,what'd you think about the 2-story that,ep014
1491,was for 445 it had some Craftsman,ep014
1494,features with the pillars in the front,ep014
1497,of the house I like that I loved the way,ep014
1500,it looked on the outside yeah good job,ep014
1503,with that yeah it had a pool for the,ep014
1506,girls Anakin for the girls for Amber and,ep014
1509,four bedrooms what did that mean either,ep014
1512,guest room or diva den so I wouldn't I,ep014
1515,probably have to give up my space to do,ep014
1518,that you know we could figure something,ep014
1521,out there there's a definitely a lot of,ep014
1524,potential and then there was the,ep014
1527,two-story Spanish priced at three,ep014
1530,hundred and eighty four thousand nine,ep014
1533,hundred dollars I love the price that,ep014
1536,was great it's not my style,ep014
1539,I know,ep014
1542,my style but I could have my diva den do,ep014
1545,you kid and there's a place for about,ep014
1548,parents to see I know I like that too,ep014
1551,it did not have a pool for the girls,ep014
1554,yeah but did you pay HOAs they do have,ep014
1557,the pool we can use yeah car garage,ep014
1560,that's true I don't know I already know,ep014
1563,which house I think we should get okay,ep014
1566,let's go because I get my diva Den I'm,ep014
1569,gonna give you your two-story,ep014
1572,spanish-style house Oh too late okay,ep014

1662,sized yard what would you rather have,ep014
1665,would you want some little old pool over,ep014
1668,there do you think or puppy having my,ep014

1674,we we have a pool in our community we,ep014
1677,have a large enough lot we can put a,ep014
1680,pool in later you know we got everything,ep014
1683,we needed for the family oh it's worse,ep014
1686,you can barely get along it just feels,ep014
1689,so good to be settled in one place and,ep014
1692,know we're staying here we're gonna be,ep014
1695,here long term and it,ep014
1698,our home my kids feel it can they feel,ep014
1701,it in the family it's wonderful what is,ep014
1704,this we're gonna see about that what,ep014

1710,gonna happen in this house and in this,ep014
1713,area and we're really looking forward to,ep014
1716,creating lots of memories here in the,ep014
1719,years to come,ep014
12,[Music],ep015
15,welcome to the rule when Jeff's work,ep015
18,relocated him to Africa this is a new,ep015
21,career for me a new area that I've never,ep015
24,really worked in he saw it as a family,ep015
27,adventure this is the once-in-a-lifetime,ep015
30,opportunity we're moving to Africa I,ep015
33,want to feel like I'm in Africa he's a,ep015
36,very polite day but for Melissa it's a,ep015
39,different kind of experience I'm really,ep015
42,concerned about how remote this house is,ep015
45,I have to admit Pam nervous about this,ep015
48,move to Nairobi you have a nice view,ep015
51,this is way too high,ep015
54,Wow look at this yeah this is a nice,ep015
57,space but this is not Kenya can be,ep015
60,harder on me than anyone else,ep015
63,[Music],ep015
66,we're both born and raised in Minnesota,ep015
69,met in college in the rest is history,ep015
72,I'm so glad you guys came can you you,ep015
75,wanna give me help with it Thanks,ep015
78,I work as a marketing manager and,ep015
81,Nairobi is a place that I've been asked,ep015
84,to go and relocate for work what are the,ep015
87,kids think about the movie I just don't,ep015
90,think they have any clue what's going on,ep015
93,though,ep015
96,what's your cooking some bacon burgers,ep015
99,and brats we have a very busy life here,ep015
102,in Minnesota we have two kids we're,ep015
105,constantly running from work to the kids,ep015
108,activities to family I love my,ep015
111,administer to life and the opportunity,ep015
114,came up it just seems like a perfect,ep015
117,times just to fully immerse our kids in,ep015
120,the new culture I'm a bit terrified and,ep015
123,leaving my job of nightmares I've never,ep015
126,been a stay-at-home mom along with,ep015
129,transitioning into a new culture and,ep015
132,country it's gonna be harder I'm even,ep015
135,anyone else we're moving from Minnesota,ep015
138,to Africa I want to feel like we're in,ep015
141,Africa knowing that I'm going to be a,ep015
144,stay-at-home mom I want all the,ep015
147,amenities and entertainment that I can,ep015
150,get for my kids Nairobi is the capital,ep015
153,of Kenya and one of Africa's most modern,ep015
156,cities strong growth has put the country,ep015
159,on the map for companies looking to set,ep015
162,up African hubs Nairobi is also,ep015
165,undergoing a construction boom with real,ep015
168,estate projects and skies,ep015
171,coming up in the city there will be new,ep015
174,office a market piece it's an,ep015
177,intersection between the north and south,ep015
180,africa moving in to nairobi big city a,ep015
183,lot of traffic it's a huge culture shock,ep015
186,it can be chaotic we're looking for a,ep015
189,four-bedroom home I'd like to at least,ep015
192,have three bathrooms and then what I'm,ep015
195,hoping for is that we have a,ep015
198,community-based area to live in so that,ep015
201,I can meet other families hopefully with,ep015
204,kids and we can have playdates you want,ep015
207,to get gated community and for me I'd,ep015
210,really like to having a more standalone,ep015
213,traditional home something with the,ep015
216,larger yard I want to feel like we're in,ep015
219,Africa and then a shorter commute is,ep015
222,important for me okay in terms of budget,ep015
225,Jeff tell me how much are you willing to,ep015
228,"to spend for your housing yeah 3,500 per",ep015
231,month hmm staying on budget is gonna be,ep015
234,very important for me we're going from,ep015
237,to income down to one and I'm looking,ep015
240,for what's the best fit house for us and,ep015
243,maybe see what the budget looks like,ep015
246,this is a very complicated couple very,ep015
249,modern on the one hand very traditional,ep015
252,on the other making this transition from,ep015
255,Minnesota to Africa is something that I,ep015
258,want to embrace fully so I want to feel,ep015
261,like I'm in Nairobi with her clients,ep015
264,seemingly split on their top priorities,ep015
267,Susan gears her choice for house 1,ep015
270,towards Melissa,ep015
273,is very maintenance-free a good,ep015
276,community filled with lots of children,ep015
279,so this is a jade Valley property it's a,ep015
282,four-bedroom four-bathroom property and,ep015
285,it is in a gated community,ep015
288,perfect and it has all the amenities,ep015
291,that you wanted is that our neighbors,ep015
294,front door right next to this front door,ep015
297,as well yes but this is what a good,ep015
300,community feels and looks like okay it,ep015
303,has a swimming pool tennis courts you,ep015
306,also have a playground for the children,ep015
309,perfect they're gonna love it how far,ep015
312,from work is this so here you're about,ep015
315,five minutes from the office I could,ep015
318,almost even come home for lunch then it,ep015
321,is a little bit above budget yes a,ep015
324,"$3,800 Wow that's $300 a month however",ep015
327,let's let's take a look so come on,ep015
330,through,ep015
333,look at this so much of the living area,ep015
336,is up top this is a study but this could,ep015
339,actually be used as a bedroom okay or it,ep015
342,could be maybe a toy room for the kids,ep015
345,yeah it'd be a bit small for a bedroom,ep015
348,but maybe you're tired okay this is a,ep015
351,dining and living room area Wow look at,ep015
354,this Jeff yeah this is a nice space,ep015
357,it's big it's open but this is not Kenya,ep015
360,oh this is okay we just find this back,ep015
363,home look it has everything it's not,ep015
366,really what I was expecting you have a,ep015
369,little fireplace as well we're on the,ep015
372,equator though what are we refer for,ep015
375,July and August do get cool it's good,ep015
378,okay I think it has everything that we,ep015
381,need and our hope for I can adjust with,ep015
384,the kids easily I could really see us,ep015
387,living here here's our terrace area come,ep015
390,on - oh wow this is great table and,ep015
393,everything is that our neighbor's,ep015
396,balcony right there so that is your,ep015
399,neighbor's balcony that's something new,ep015
402,that we'd have to be used to being so,ep015
405,close to neighbors Jeff good over how,ep015
408,close our neighbors are you're gonna,ep015
411,love moving in here so this is a kitchen,ep015
414,it definitely looks modern but Wow,ep015
417,look at how little this refrigerator is,ep015
420,and this oven it's so small I don't know,ep015
423,if I can make dinner this is actually,ep015
426,finished quite well for Nairobi and it,ep015
429,seems pretty closed off I mean if the,ep015
432,kids were playing and you were in here,ep015
435,cooking you wouldn't really be able to,ep015
438,hear them or see them no no that's it,ep015
441,that's a big deal for me so up here we,ep015
444,have three bedrooms two identical,ep015
447,bedrooms all bedrooms are on sweets okay,ep015
450,so this is your bedroom,ep015
453,and it comes with everything that you,ep015
456,see Wow okay so we don't have to worry,ep015
459,about bringing any of that with us I,ep015
462,could definitely see us you know staying,ep015
465,here this is just like Minnesota there's,ep015
468,really not much difference I don't know,ep015
471,that I'm in Kenya oh look at this bad,ep015
474,room it looks modern the shower is big,ep015
477,and the sink area looks great this is,ep015
480,pretty nice furnishings I love the,ep015
483,community feel my kids would love it,ep015
486,here I need all the help that I can in,ep015
489,order to adjust here we need to get to,ep015
492,know our neighbors have a community here,ep015
495,have that tribe that's gonna help me,ep015
498,with my kids and for me I just don't,ep015
501,know if I could be able to live that,ep015
504,close to neighbors and it's a budget -,ep015
507,we are $300 over budget,ep015
510,I really like to see standalone home and,ep015
513,I'd really like to see something at or,ep015
516,under budget okay,ep015
519,this property is huge,ep015
522,Susan takes the doll family to a,ep015
525,traditional standalone house but I feel,ep015
528,like this is a little too remote I think,ep015
531,it's gonna be difficult to get to know,ep015
534,people here,ep015
537,[Music],ep015
540,this is the definition to koala trust,ep015
543,these elephants have been rescued from,ep015
546,my different places in the country when,ep015
549,Jeff is assigned a new job in Africa to,ep015
552,be able to go on a safari I'm excited,ep015
555,for anything I hope everyone else is,ep015
558,well listen new it would mean big,ep015
561,changes for her and the kids I like to,ep015
564,have plans in place and be organized and,ep015
567,I got to go with the flow girl I have,ep015
570,tuned am nervous about my kids I think,ep015
573,this is going to be a huge transition,ep015
576,for them really nervous about it while,ep015
579,melissa is focusing on the needs of the,ep015
582,kids has a tennis court a playground for,ep015
585,the children perfect they're gonna love,ep015
588,it,ep015
591,Jeff is adjusting to his new routine how,ep015
594,far from work is this about five minutes,ep015
597,from the office I can I must even come,ep015
600,home for lunch then but it doesn't have,ep015
603,the traditional feel this is just like,ep015
606,Minnesota there's really not much,ep015
609,difference I don't know that I'm in,ep015
612,Kenya and it's too expensive for Jeff a,ep015
615,"$3,800 Wow that's $300 a month would you",ep015
618,like a pet elephant yeah if Britta wants,ep015
621,a pet elephant house 2 is going to have,ep015
624,to be a little more affordable Jeff will,ep015
627,love it gets a lot of garden space he,ep015
630,gets a lot of privacy Melissa on the,ep015
633,other hands she may feel it's a bit too,ep015
636,lonely doesn't have the community feel,ep015
639,that she wants she's very anxious about,ep015
642,this,ep015
645,this property is huge,ep015
648,this is exactly what I've been looking,ep015
651,for this is a stand-alone home,ep015
654,traditional Kenyan home it's not in a,ep015
657,gated community you get lots of privacy,ep015
660,lots of garden yes perfect but to me it,ep015
663,screams a ton of work for us it is three,ep015
666,bedrooms three and a half baths and this,ep015
669,"is little under budget for $3,400 even",ep015
672,better yeah but it's a lot of work I,ep015
675,don't know how I'm going to manage it,ep015
678,that would be just too much work for us,ep015
681,so let's have a low okay okay it's big,ep015
684,it's open its Airy feel like I'm finally,ep015
687,in Nairobi perfect this is definitely,ep015
690,not modern but I like the space this,ep015
693,would work this is the kind of character,ep015
696,I was looking for I really like this,ep015
699,table and it leads right into the,ep015
702,kitchen oh great okay now this is modern,ep015
705,it's huge,ep015
708,Wow it's got a full size fridge the only,ep015
711,thing is it would be difficult if I was,ep015
714,preparing lunch to see the kids in the,ep015
717,living space there's almost enough room,ep015
720,for the kids to play in here though this,ep015
723,is bigger than we even have back home in,ep015
726,the u.s. so that's sure I'm feeling a,ep015
729,little bit anxious this is gonna be a,ep015
732,tough sell to Jeff he loves this place,ep015
735,and I don't know how I'm gonna convince,ep015
738,them that we need a community this is a,ep015
741,master bedroom okay this is very big,ep015
744,very open this bedroom is exactly the,ep015
747,charm and character that I was looking,ep015
750,for it is quite romantic in here but it,ep015
753,might be just too big to Jeff I don't,ep015
756,know how many we're gonna maintain this,ep015
759,house this is the once-in-a-lifetime,ep015
762,opportunity this is even better than,ep015
765,what I was asking for look at this very,ep015
768,Morden,ep015
771,beautiful tiles yes it definitely has,ep015
774,that romantic feel coming from the,ep015
777,bedroom and is the modern feel that,ep015
780,you're looking for - it does wow this is,ep015
783,look at best here you have a one acre,ep015
786,garden it's gigantic what's beautiful,ep015
789,about this house is that the outdoor,ep015
792,living space is just as much as the,ep015
795,indoor living space this is perfect it,ep015
798,gives us the good option of having,ep015
801,indoor and outdoor living spaces and,ep015
804,really allows us to truly embrace what,ep015
807,living in Kenny could be about I do have,ep015
810,to agree this is a great space,ep015
813,especially knowing the weather is,ep015
816,perfect here all year round but I'm,ep015
819,really concerned about how big this,ep015
822,house is and the garden space this seems,ep015
825,like so much work for us I feel like,ep015
828,this is a little too remote and think,ep015
831,it's gonna be difficult to get to know,ep015
834,people here in moving to Nairobi I want,ep015
837,Kenyan Flair African characteristics and,ep015
840,this house has it and I'm close to work,ep015
843,this is perfect you have a pool you have,ep015
846,a gym you have a community fill it comes,ep015
849,up right on budget great ask for Nairobi,ep015
852,and I got Miami,ep015
855,this is Navi National Park in the city,ep015
858,this is the land of milk and honey,ep015
861,caribou niece Anna kids children what,ep015
864,are you looking forward to see the doll,ep015
867,family is moving to Nairobi to follow a,ep015
870,job opportunity for Jeff I want Kenan,ep015
873,Flair African characteristics to fully,ep015
876,immerse our kids in a new culture and I,ep015
879,think that's part of what's exciting,ep015
882,about is just the unknown of over moving,ep015
885,into it to be honest I am a bit,ep015
888,terrified of being a stay-at-home mom I,ep015
891,want all the amenities and entertainment,ep015
894,that I can get for my kids,ep015
897,[Applause],ep015
900,house 1 gets Melissa the community,ep015
903,feeling she's looking for it has all the,ep015
906,amenities that you wanted it has a,ep015
909,swimming pool a playground for the,ep015
912,children perfect they're gonna love it,ep015
915,but it's too expensive and too crowded,ep015
918,for Jeff is that our neighbor's balcony,ep015
921,right there yeah that's something new,ep015
924,that we'd have to get used to or moving,ep015
927,to Africa I want to feel like I'm in,ep015
930,Africa this is gonna be a long journey,ep015
933,for house 2 susan offers a standalone,ep015
936,option this is exactly what I've been,ep015
939,looking for this property is huge it's,ep015
942,big its open its air you feel like I'm,ep015
945,finally in Nairobi but for Melissa it's,ep015
948,too isolated and too big it's gonna be,ep015
951,difficult to get to know people here,ep015
954,children can you see the buffalos can,ep015
957,you see them where's the Buffalo oh,ep015
960,you've got some zebras over there for,ep015
963,house 3 Susan picks a non-budget,ep015
966,penthouse apartment in a gated community,ep015
969,with all the amenities for Melissa that,ep015
972,seems like we've been driving forever,ep015
975,yes Jeff you're going towards your 20,ep015
978,minutes you know into the office and,ep015
981,maybe a little longer that's something,ep015
984,we definitely need to take into,ep015
987,consideration this is the courtyard in,ep015
990,Lovington very family-friendly the unit,ep015
993,that we're looking at is a penthouse,ep015
996,apartment at the top it is a three,ep015
999,bedroom three and a half bath property,ep015
1002,you have a pool you have a gym you have,ep015
1005,a community Phil it comes up right on,ep015
1008,"budget at $3,500 a month okay that's",ep015
1011,right on great feel like I'm kind of,ep015
1014,getting ganged up on this is more Miami,ep015
1017,than Nairobi so guys come through this,ep015
1020,way welcome to the courtyard,ep015
1023,yeah this is definitely my taste his,ep015
1026,definitely doesn't feel like Africa,ep015
1029,though I love the fireplace,ep015
1032,this is it's beautiful it looks straight,ep015
1035,out of a magazine glass tables with,ep015
1038,little kids I don't know if that's gonna,ep015
1041,work so this is a dining area look at,ep015
1044,this table it's gorgeous,ep015
1047,it's beautiful and it connects to this,ep015
1050,gorgeous kitchen very open I mean I can,ep015
1053,see every neighbors Terrace yeah that's,ep015
1056,true I guess we'll get to know them a,ep015
1059,little better,ep015
1062,Susan is tailoring towards me when it,ep015
1065,comes to this penthouse and we'll just,ep015
1068,have to work on Jeff and make some,ep015
1071,progress so the kitchen modern fully,ep015
1074,fitted I mean what more could you,ep015
1077,possibly ask for this is a very nice,ep015
1080,kitchen I have to say yeah I think this,ep015
1083,is fantastic it is nice I do like it and,ep015
1086,it is open so we're making progress what,ep015
1089,does that mean so here you have one,ep015
1092,bedroom okay a second ensuite oh look at,ep015
1095,this Jeff it'd be great for one of the,ep015
1098,kids maybe Britta very light and bright,ep015
1101,mm-hmm and then this is a master bedroom,ep015
1104,beautiful king-size bed lots of space I,ep015
1107,was not expecting this this is beautiful,ep015
1110,it's modern the chandelier Wow there is,ep015
1113,lots of space but there's no privacy at,ep015
1116,all it's a city Melissa gets excited,ep015
1119,about something,ep015
1122,she just doesn't hear anything else this,ep015
1125,is not looking good for me Wow look at,ep015
1128,this yeah I love the his in her we have,ep015
1131,this in Minnesota it's great the rain,ep015
1134,shower that sounds amazing,ep015
1137,oh come take a look nice right give a,ep015
1140,nice this is way too high it's beautiful,ep015
1143,but I don't want to sit and worry about,ep015
1146,my kids being on this railing all the,ep015
1149,time it's just really too high I love,ep015
1152,this case I really like how modern this,ep015
1155,is and the layout of this space I also,ep015
1158,like that it's in a community I just,ep015
1161,cannot believe how high up we are,ep015
1164,do like that we're on budget but the,ep015
1167,drive to get here this wood took quite,ep015
1170,some time I'm really worried about the,ep015
1173,commute and I asked for Nairobi and I,ep015
1176,think I got Miami work what coming into,ep015
1179,Nairobi from Minnesota where we had all,ep015
1182,of our friends and families supporting,ep015
1185,us and now we don't have that tribe we,ep015
1188,having that data community is really,ep015
1191,important to me we didn't move here just,ep015
1194,to have a place that we could get back,ep015
1197,home we're moving to Africa I want to,ep015
1200,feel like a minute I just still cannot,ep015
1203,believe how green and luscious is here I,ep015
1206,love it,ep015
1209,Jeff Melissa and the kids are moving,ep015
1212,from Minnesota to Nairobi Kenya after,ep015
1215,Jeff was transferred at work I really,ep015
1218,want to embrace the African culture,ep015
1221,we're moving to Africa I want to feel,ep015
1224,like I'm in Africa now honestly who,ep015
1227,would have thought we could go to a,ep015
1230,safari in our backyard I am worried that,ep015
1233,I'm going to have the most difficult,ep015
1236,transition not only going from Minnesota,ep015
1239,to Kenya but also go,ep015
1242,from working full time to being a,ep015
1245,stay-at-home mom it's gonna be harder on,ep015
1248,me than anyone else and so looking at,ep015
1251,Jade Valley I see that gated community,ep015
1254,it is a four-bedroom four-bathroom,ep015
1257,property and it has all the amenities,ep015
1260,that you wanted perfect,ep015
1263,neighbors would literally be right on,ep015
1266,top of us that's something new that we'd,ep015
1269,have to get used to being so close to,ep015
1272,"neighbors and that price $3,800 that's",ep015
1275,$300 a month over budget and the,ep015
1278,stand-alone home was $100 under budget,ep015
1281,this property is huge it's big its open,ep015
1284,its Airy I feel like I'm finally in,ep015
1287,Nairobi perfect but this house is too,ep015
1290,big I don't know how I'm going to manage,ep015
1293,it that would be just too much work for,ep015
1296,us this is exactly what I've been,ep015
1299,looking for and then the court hearing,ep015
1302,which came in and right at budget,ep015
1305,this is definitely my taste and that,ep015
1308,also has that gated community which is a,ep015
1311,bonus facilities come which is lovely,ep015
1314,pool there's a gym I just don't know if,ep015
1317,I can handle that community potentially,ep015
1320,an hour away depending on traffic I,ep015
1323,definitely think that the courtyard is,ep015
1326,perfect for us,ep015
1329,[Music],ep015
1332,I think we are in agreement on one thing,ep015
1335,I think there is one property that we,ep015
1338,can eliminate the courtyard that Terrace,ep015
1341,is not for me or the kids yeah and that,ep015
1344,commute time just is not suitable for,ep015
1347,our family I agree,ep015
1350,so we're down to two,ep015
1353,we are the standalone and then another,ep015
1356,property yeah,ep015
1359,but Jade Valley oh yes the stand-alone,ep015
1362,home really gives us the feel of Africa,ep015
1365,it is too much space I feel like it's,ep015
1368,gonna be a full-time job maintaining,ep015
1371,that I really think that Jade Valley is,ep015
1374,a great home for us but the privacy the,ep015
1377,open space the green space and that,ep015
1380,really gives us the indoor/outdoor space,ep015
1383,that we were looking for,ep015
1386,why are we talking anymore we need a,ep015
1389,community and not the standalone home,ep015
1392,and the Jade Valley home it also has the,ep015
1395,playground and a pool we don't have any,ep015
1398,of that in the stand-alone home I still,ep015
1401,don't think it'd be nice to be able to,ep015
1404,have a place of our own,ep015
1407,yes you are so close to us you could,ep015
1410,even come home for lunch you even said,ep015
1413,it yourself you know what you're giving,ep015
1416,up your job to come here I think it's,ep015
1419,important that you're happy I can see,ep015
1422,the kids playing in the playground so I,ep015
1425,think you're right Jade Valley,ep015
1428,[Music],ep015
1431,we're really adjusting so nicely here,ep015
1434,it's such a breath of fresh air how well,ep015
1437,things have gone we've really adjusted,ep015
1440,nicely to the house everything is done,ep015
1443,we don't have to worry about maintenance,ep015
1446,the kids and I had lots to do Johnny,ep015
1449,Missouri sauna I absolutely feel that,ep015
1452,we've given our kids a gift that we,ep015
1455,could never have thought of when we were,ep015
1458,in Minnesota we spend most of our,ep015
1461,weekends out and about we've gone on,ep015
1464,safaris we've gone out to the coast just,ep015
1467,taking family vacations it's been a,ep015
1470,great transition for us,ep015
1473,[Music],ep015
12,my god just look at this kitchen,ep016
15,recent transplants Suzanne and Nick are,ep016
18,trying to replicate a texas-sized luxury,ep016
21,home for their family in big city,ep016
24,Chicago I think in Texas this qualifies,ep016
27,as a heart so I don't know that that,ep016
30,would be a fireplace in Texas but,ep016
33,they're bumping up against a little,ep016
36,sticker shock you actually have some,ep016
39,more green space not much six hundred,ep016
42,and fifteen thousand dollars in Texas,ep016
45,would get us like seven bedroom mansion,ep016
48,on a huge lot but how much will they,ep016
51,compromise to get the craftsman of her,ep016
54,dreams I don't see any place to put like,ep016
57,a television I don't care how many baths,ep016
60,have you taken in the last year oh it's,ep016
63,pretty high to be so far out away from,ep016
66,the kids school and so we'll take it,ep016
69,[Music],ep016
72,who's ready for some pizza,ep016
75,I'm Suzanne and I'm a nurse practitioner,ep016
78,my name is Nick and I'm a sales manager,ep016
81,for a pharmaceutical company we have two,ep016
84,boys Ethan he's 12 years old and Mason,ep016
87,who's 7 years old and then we have our,ep016
90,precious boxer penny I don't know that,ep016
93,you can put down two of those the way we,ep016
96,met was that we were in the same high,ep016
99,school in San Antonio Texas together and,ep016
102,after a couple years of persistence on,ep016
105,my part she decided that she would go,ep016
108,ahead and we started dating we've been,ep016
111,married for 15 years now I'm not with,ep016
114,you,ep016
117,too much barbecue also so we moved from,ep016
120,San Antonio Chicago because I got a job,ep016
123,promotion with my current company we,ep016
126,were sad to leave our friends and our,ep016
129,family back home but we were excited at,ep016
132,being in a big city and all of the,ep016
135,things that we could explore you can,ep016
138,walk a couple blocks and there's a new,ep016
141,restaurant on the most of your block,ep016
144,that you can try they've been renting an,ep016
147,apartment in the Lincoln Park section of,ep016
150,the city since moving to Chicago 18,ep016
153,months ago since we moved here we have,ep016
156,been looking for homes but to find one,ep016
159,in our price range has been very,ep016
162,difficult originally our budget was 450,ep016
165,thousand dollars but we quickly learned,ep016
168,that that was not going to get us what,ep016
171,we needed and I think if you can bump,ep016
174,that up even a little bit more even,ep016
177,"stretching it into the $650,000 range",ep016
180,we'll be able to accomplish a whole lot,ep016
183,more in your wish list I think we're,ep016
186,willing to go up yeah as far as six,ep016
189,fifty they're hoping that they're,ep016
192,increased budget will allow them to stay,ep016
195,in their current neighborhood Lincoln,ep016
198,Park we really love being close to,ep016
201,downtown it's an easy train ride down,ep016
204,the museum's Chicago's got some of the,ep016
207,best museums in the world this is where,ep016
210,the kids school is and so we would love,ep016
213,to stay in this neighborhood I mean,ep016
216,ideally we would love a single-family,ep016
219,home that has a yard of course I really,ep016
222,am open to town homes or condos,ep016
225,something with a shared wall that,ep016
228,doesn't bother me as much as it does,ep016
231,Suzanne this style of home I like the,ep016
234,most are the contemporary more modern,ep016
237,homes I really like the clean lines the,ep016
240,big glass windows it doesn't feel like,ep016
243,something that maybe my mom or dad could,ep016
246,have lived in it feels like it's more,ep016
249,modern more up today more high-tech,ep016
252,I hate the more modern contemporary home,ep016
255,I prefer a Craftsman style home we owned,ep016
258,a Dutch colonial home in San Antonio it,ep016
261,was built in the 1920s and it had a lot,ep016
264,of the original character I love that,ep016
267,happy wife happy life free in our new,ep016
270,home we would love three bedrooms two,ep016
273,baths two-car garage we really need to,ep016
276,have at least two living spaces right,ep016
279,now in our apartment we only have one,ep016
282,living space and with the two boys is,ep016
285,just Donna from when we have like,ep016
288,friends over with their kids we can have,ep016
291,the adults upstairs and then we can send,ep016
294,the kids downstairs of the basement they,ep016
297,can watch a movie or they can play video,ep016
300,games we also want to make sure that we,ep016
303,have a nice chefs type kitchen a,ep016
306,top-of-the-line kitchen is important to,ep016
309,both of us because we both love to cook,ep016
312,we would also love a home with a yard,ep016
315,for our dog and of course the boys as,ep016
318,well well I definitely wouldn't mind,ep016
321,considering something that needed a,ep016
324,little bit of work I mean it's not a ton,ep016
327,of work I do not want to have to do any,ep016
330,work to the home we just remodel the,ep016
333,kitchen in Texas and I do not want to go,ep016
336,through that again I am really nervous,ep016
339,to not find something that we really,ep016
342,love the last thing I want to do is,ep016
345,spend a lot of money on a home that,ep016
348,doesn't fit our needs first up they're,ep016
351,seeing a home close to their target area,ep016
354,in Lakeview I love this neighborhood,ep016
357,yeah I mean it's very close to the kids,ep016
360,school for sure but I do notice that,ep016
363,this is a very busy street it is a very,ep016
366,busy street this must be the place right,ep016
369,here is it yeah I different don't love,ep016
372,it definitely not the craftsman I was,ep016
375,looking for it's not contemporary or,ep016
378,craftsman,ep016
381,so I noticed that this is like off a,ep016
384,really busy street it is one of the main,ep016
387,streets that get you in and out of the,ep016
390,city but what's nice is it also makes it,ep016
393,easier for any of your daily commute,ep016
396,this is a three-bedroom,ep016
399,two-and-a-half-bath property listed at,ep016
402,"$615,000 that's what our range it feels",ep016
405,like a single-family home although it is,ep016
408,technically a town okay is the shared,ep016
411,wall I know you didn't really want that,ep016
414,no not really,ep016
417,six hundred and fifteen thousand dollars,ep016
420,in Texas would get us like seven bedroom,ep016
423,mansion on a huge lot so how this home,ep016
426,is set up you've got the living area,ep016
429,down here as we move up you'll see the,ep016
432,second one so this is one of two living,ep016
435,areas correct okay this flooring is,ep016
438,definitely like a nice slate look I mean,ep016
441,it definitely looks more modern and you,ep016
444,have this very place it's electric yeah,ep016
447,I think in Texas this qualifies as an,ep016
450,arc tub I don't know that that would be,ep016
453,considered fireplace in Texas I really,ep016
456,like the purple I do not like the purple,ep016
459,it is quite ugly that's an easy fix,ep016
462,right absolutely another neat little,ep016
465,feature of this property is you have a,ep016
468,private wine room oh that you have you,ep016
471,know I I don't know about the pea here I,ep016
474,hate this tile I like it you're not,ep016
477,gonna find this in every other house,ep016
480,there's a half bath which is nice on the,ep016
483,bottom floor to have that for your,ep016
486,guests it's very well done very well,ep016
489,finished very modern first bedroom this,ep016
492,is the only bedroom down here it is so,ep016
495,then Ethan probably cuz he's the oldest,ep016
498,would have to be down here by himself I,ep016
501,mean I'm sure he would love it it's just,ep016
504,you know mama bear is like wanting him,ep016
507,closer to where we we are gonna be but,ep016
510,something consider as we take a look at,ep016
513,the rest of the place for sure and I,ep016
516,think I'm gonna take you outside since,ep016
519,we're down on this level now okay this,ep016
522,is a townhouse so you have the shared,ep016
525,wall and this would be the second,ep016
528,townhome oh well that's not bad though,ep016
531,it's not like it's right next to you,ep016
534,it's behind you so this jack,ep016
537,oh it's all common area we could put our,ep016
540,patio furniture and,ep016
543,barbeque pit out here you got it as long,ep016
546,as I get invited and there's a garage as,ep016
549,well there is a garage so this townhome,ep016
552,comes with one garage spot so you get,ep016
555,half of the garage and they get the,ep016
558,other that might be an issue for you cuz,ep016
561,my car will go in the garage well yeah,ep016
564,they head back in and up to the second,ep016
567,floor oh this is a huge space it's just,ep016
570,great this is nice open floor concept,ep016
573,beautiful fireplace with the built-in,ep016
576,surrounding it gorgeous shots kitchen is,ep016
579,this built in it is built in because it,ep016
582,limits the space that you use I mean we,ep016
585,have to have your dining room here yeah,ep016
588,and we have a huge table man I,ep016
591,definitely like the counter space,ep016
594,because the kids could sit there in the,ep016
597,morning eat breakfast but this is a nice,ep016
600,huge range I'm not crazy about the I,ep016
603,love it the hood I wouldn't change a,ep016
606,thing in this kitchen this is a very,ep016
609,modern look it's very nice and you've,ep016
612,got a hidden fridge you don't always see,ep016
615,that but this is a nice feature what is,ep016
618,this so right over here you've got your,ep016
621,microwave Wow interesting very modern,ep016
624,feel to it,ep016
627,nice this is a great space for sure so,ep016
630,now we're gonna go up to the third floor,ep016
633,where the master bedroom is along with,ep016
636,the third bedroom so this is the master,ep016
639,the master and you've got dual,ep016
642,his-and-her closets,ep016
645,maybe my clothes might fit jetted tub,ep016
648,this is a little bit outdated they see,ep016
651,another bed and bath for the boys,ep016
654,[Music],ep016
657,it wasn't either the Kospi nor the,ep016
660,contemporaries thought that we were,ep016
663,looking for and then there really wasn't,ep016
666,a yard for our dog you know having one,ep016
669,kid all the way on the bottom floor by,ep016
672,himself and then him having to come up,ep016
675,here in a shower and get dressed is not,ep016
678,really ideal either you are making the,ep016
681,transition from Texas here to City and,ep016
684,so with that there's going to be some,ep016
687,compromises especially when it comes,ep016
690,down to the space and the layout of the,ep016
693,properties so alex is showing them,ep016
696,another potential compromise it is that,ep016
699,modern contemporary style that you were,ep016
702,looking for I love it that he was,ep016
705,looking for,ep016
708,[Music],ep016
711,Texas transplants Suzanne and Nick are,ep016
714,having a hard time adjusting to what,ep016
717,their 650 thousand dollar budget will,ep016
720,get them in Chicago they've seen a,ep016
723,townhouse close to their target area but,ep016
726,it wasn't the modern style he wants or,ep016
729,the Craftsman style she wants they also,ep016
732,didn't like the lack of yards and that,ep016
735,the bedrooms for their boys were on,ep016
738,separate floors interesting Street today,ep016
741,they're seeing a home outside their,ep016
744,target area in Logan Square I'm more,ep016
747,concerned about the distance that was,ep016
750,what do you think about 15-20 minutes,ep016
753,yeah when I envisioned a modern home in,ep016
756,Chicago this was it not the craftsman,ep016
759,that I was hoping for,ep016
762,hi hello this is Grace is perfect it's,ep016
765,an actually a single-family home with a,ep016
768,detached two-car garage five hundred,ep016
771,ninety nine thousand nine hundred,ep016
774,dollars it's pretty good it is that,ep016
777,modern contemporary style that you were,ep016
780,looking at I love it it's great that he,ep016
783,was looking for oh this is nice and open,ep016
786,we've got the floor-to-ceiling windows,ep016
789,over here that brings in a ton of,ep016
792,natural light this house doesn't have,ep016
795,any sort of character it's just overall,ep016
798,very sterile very boring this is,ep016
801,definitely not the chef's style like we,ep016
804,saw yesterday,ep016
807,no but it's updated for sure I love the,ep016
810,white cabinets but the appliances are,ep016
813,not as nice that was picturing like a,ep016
816,big island may my workstation you're,ep016
819,looking for the wow factor absolutely oh,ep016
822,this is nice it's not gonna be that bad,ep016
825,right exactly do you have a half bath,ep016
828,right over here and then this back space,ep016
831,can really be utilizes another living,ep016
834,space or maybe a formal dining room yeah,ep016
837,I mean we would need a place for our big,ep016
840,table is there an additional living,ep016
843,space because we definitely want a two,ep016
846,living spaces this house does have that,ep016
849,and we'll see that downstairs when we,ep016
852,get into the basement this is nice it's,ep016
855,got another really neat look I was gonna,ep016
858,say are the ugly light fixtures done,ep016
861,with it's the same feel throughout the,ep016
864,home though which is nice though very,ep016
867,excited to show you the outdoors,ep016
870,this is a beautiful back deck oh this is,ep016
873,nice nice grill out here absolutely yeah,ep016
876,perfect off the back I like the color,ep016
879,see this is more modern I don't know,ep016
882,that it's big enough for all of our,ep016
885,patio furniture though or make it work,ep016
888,you actually have some more green space,ep016
891,not much that garage looks brand-new -,ep016
894,yeah no that's very nice now we're gonna,ep016
897,go down into the basement which i think,ep016
900,is a really big selling feature this,ep016
903,property okay it's a huge space oh wow,ep016
906,this is Hugh this is Barry,ep016
909,the kids could basically play football,ep016
912,game down here is great they see a,ep016
915,laundry room wet bar and full bath then,ep016
918,head up two flights of stairs to the,ep016
921,second floor first bedroom okay double,ep016
924,closet this is a good size,ep016
927,yeah and through here is the Jack and,ep016
930,Jill bathroom oh it's great for the boys,ep016
933,I love Jack and Jill bath rooms we had,ep016
936,one in Texas yeah the second bedroom,ep016
939,okay this is really small that's really,ep016
942,spot in Chicago these size bedrooms are,ep016
945,about standard and until you're going,ep016
948,into the higher price point homes yeah,ep016
951,this is really truly the layout you're,ep016
954,gonna see and now I'm very excited to,ep016
957,show you what I think is one of the best,ep016
960,masters that I have seen in quite some,ep016
963,time,ep016
966,look at all this light wow this is great,ep016
969,Alex huge it's got the beautiful windows,ep016
972,that I love mega walk-in closet it's not,ep016
975,finished but it's huge,ep016
978,come see the master bathroom this is,ep016
981,nice and big and it's a nice modern,ep016
984,finish you know look at the tile of the,ep016
987,tile runs all the way from the floor,ep016
990,into the bath commence a nice look yeah,ep016
993,I do love the tiles,ep016
996,[Music],ep016
999,after looking at this house this is,ep016
1002,really what I envisioned for us when we,ep016
1005,moved to Chicago me not so much,ep016
1008,it's move-in-ready which is something,ep016
1011,you really wanted to car garage I mean,ep016
1014,which is a big plus both we're about,ep016
1017,parking on the street guys would still,ep016
1020,love to see a Craftsman style home you,ep016
1023,just have to be willing to maybe make,ep016
1026,some compromises and I know you feel,ep016
1029,like you're already doing a lot of that,ep016
1032,but welcome to the city mm-hmm so how,ep016
1035,much is Suzanne ready to compromise this,ep016
1038,place was a lot further than I was,ep016
1041,hoping,ep016
1044,oh my god it's beautiful,ep016
1047,[Music],ep016
1050,Nik and Suzanne have been experiencing,ep016
1053,some sticker shock since moving from,ep016
1056,Texas to Chicago as they've struggled to,ep016
1059,find a single-family home with enough,ep016
1062,space and a yard for their families,ep016
1065,priced under six hundred and fifty,ep016
1068,thousand dollars so far they've seen a,ep016
1071,townhome with no yard in their target,ep016
1074,area and a single-family home that was,ep016
1077,farther out and didn't have the,ep016
1080,Craftsman style Suzanne is hoping for,ep016
1083,today they're seeing a home in Irving,ep016
1086,Park over 30 minutes from their target,ep016
1089,area so this place was a lot further,ep016
1092,than I was hoping I think this is,ep016
1095,definitely a questionable as far as,ep016
1098,being able to get to the kids school on,ep016
1101,time every morning what do you think oh,ep016
1104,my god it's beautiful,ep016
1107,this is exactly the Craftsman style home,ep016
1110,you were picturing yeah it's not exactly,ep016
1113,the modern home I was hoping for feeling,ep016
1116,the love four bedrooms three and a half,ep016
1119,baths oh that's a lot of space it is at,ep016
1122,the top of your budget at six hundred,ep016
1125,and fifty thousand it's pretty high to,ep016
1128,be so far out away from the kids school,ep016
1131,and but we'll take it here we go oh wow,ep016
1134,look at this this is coffered ceilings,ep016
1137,this is definitely the Craftsman style,ep016
1140,home she was looking for it and it's new,ep016
1143,it's updated so it gives you a little,ep016
1146,bit of a modern feel to it,ep016
1149,but I don't see any place to put like a,ep016
1152,television first starters I don't care I,ep016
1155,mean well you should we'll find a spot,ep016
1158,for the TV there is a downstairs area so,ep016
1161,you could really make that into your,ep016
1164,family space where you'd be watching the,ep016
1167,television oh my god just look at this,ep016
1170,kitchen this is your chef's kitchen,ep016
1173,I love the vent hood I love the big gas,ep016
1176,burner or something that's very nice I,ep016
1179,immediately am drawn to the backsplash,ep016
1182,custom tiles and the countertops are,ep016
1185,Carrara marble I love this big beautiful,ep016
1188,island I mean I could see the kids,ep016
1191,sitting here and doing homework you're,ep016
1194,eating or whatever right and you do have,ep016
1197,a modern light fixture it is,ep016
1200,it's not space-age well I did want to,ep016
1203,point out one less great feature and,ep016
1206,that is the half bath that's over here,ep016
1209,yeah this is really pretty I just love,ep016
1212,all of the detail the craftsmanship,ep016
1215,details are all throughout I mean even,ep016
1218,the crown molding in the bathroom it's,ep016
1221,just beautiful and I do want to show you,ep016
1224,we have a gorgeous backyard I honestly,ep016
1227,don't care if it's a patch of dirt at,ep016
1230,this point wow this is a yard yeah this,ep016
1233,is great this is definitely the biggest,ep016
1236,yard we've seen so far this is what you,ep016
1239,get when you go a little bit north yeah,ep016
1242,I mean the dog would love it out here,ep016
1245,and that looks like a brand-new two-car,ep016
1248,garage as well,ep016
1251,yeah they head back in and down to the,ep016
1254,finished basement it's new and updated,ep016
1257,it's just very small for a game room I,ep016
1260,mean the kids couldn't really run around,ep016
1263,too much in here it's not small there's,ep016
1266,a big couch in two chairs and a coffee,ep016
1269,two other properties it's small they see,ep016
1272,a bedroom and bath in the basement then,ep016
1275,head up to the second floor and this is,ep016
1278,the first of the kids rooms great big,ep016
1281,windows ready I love the ceilings,ep016
1284,they see another bed and bath and head,ep016
1287,into the master and now into the master,ep016
1290,bath oh my gosh like it just gets better,ep016
1293,and better there's no table how many,ep016
1296,baths have you taken in the last year,ep016
1299,enough to know I want a bathtub in my,ep016
1302,bathroom,ep016
1305,since you have the tub right next door,ep016
1308,you can utilize that yeah exactly that's,ep016
1311,a lot of compromising room for both you,ep016
1314,know and tables yeah yeah I will say,ep016
1317,this would definitely fit our furniture,ep016
1320,and do I see two closet closet that's,ep016
1323,perfect,ep016
1326,this is a good size,ep016
1329,I love it absolutely love it hi it's,ep016
1332,nice I mean don't get me wrong it's very,ep016
1335,nice to be crazy to say it wasn't,ep016
1338,I just don't that it hits everything on,ep016
1341,the wishlist that we need plus being so,ep016
1344,far it's like we're compromising a lot,ep016
1347,of things if I was gonna be at the top,ep016
1350,of the budget,ep016
1353,I'd want either everything on the wish,ep016
1356,list done or to be a lot closer to where,ep016
1359,we want to be after seeing several,ep016
1362,options it won't be an easy decision for,ep016
1365,Nick and Suzanne their choice may come,ep016
1368,down to location style and single family,ep016
1371,versus townhome I'm not sure I just,ep016
1374,can't believe it's taking this long,ep016
1377,[Music],ep016
1380,Suzanne and Nick have seen how much,ep016
1383,house six hundred and fifty thousand,ep016
1386,dollars will get them in Chicago now,ep016
1389,it's time to decide let's start with,ep016
1392,that three-story townhome over in,ep016
1395,Lakeview that one was 615 so it was in,ep016
1398,the middle of our budget the open floor,ep016
1401,plan was great and that kitchen was,ep016
1404,amazing,ep016
1407,it wasn't Lincoln Park but really just,ep016
1410,right across the street we were in,ep016
1413,Lincoln Park close to the kids school,ep016
1416,and their friends it wasn't really,ep016
1419,either of our Styles Oh Ethan's room or,ep016
1422,one bedroom is down in the basement and,ep016
1425,then the full bathrooms were all the way,ep016
1428,on the third floor and it only had a one,ep016
1431,car garage let's talk about the modern,ep016
1434,contemporary home at 599 which is below,ep016
1437,our budget,ep016
1440,it was fantastic I mean it was a modern,ep016
1443,contemporary look and it's a,ep016
1446,single-family home II mean that was a,ep016
1449,great option yeah but that house was,ep016
1452,almost kind of sterile looking the,ep016
1455,kitchen just lacked a lot of character,ep016
1458,there wasn't really any yard space in,ep016
1461,the back to me the distance alone is a,ep016
1464,con for sure but that basement was,ep016
1467,unbelievable in that house I mean there,ep016
1470,was a huge space so it's time to talk,ep016
1473,about my favorite home the Craftsman,ep016
1476,"style priced at 650,000 it's an every",ep016
1479,park I mean that was really far when we,ep016
1482,try to get out there I'm willing to,ep016
1485,overlook anything to get that house I,ep016
1488,love that it was a single-family home,ep016
1491,the kitchen was beautiful I had the big,ep016
1494,beautiful island that I loved it's,ep016
1497,definitely not my style at home on the,ep016
1500,outside but I did love the fact that the,ep016
1503,inside was updated that backyard also,ep016
1506,though that was amazing that's huge,ep016
1509,space,ep016
1512,the fact that that one that was in,ep016
1515,Irving Park I know it's a craftsman I,ep016
1518,know it's beautiful for it to be that,ep016
1521,much money and to be that far away it,ep016
1524,would have to be perfect and I don't,ep016
1527,think that house is quite perfect it's,ep016
1530,like you're putting a dagger in my heart,ep016
1533,I think ultimately you're right,ep016
1536,location location location all right so,ep016
1539,I think we've made a decision then yeah,ep016
1542,I think it's the Lakeview town all right,ep016
1545,let's call Alex I'm looking forward to,ep016
1548,your famous guacamole here we have been,ep016
1551,in a new home for about four weeks now,ep016
1554,and it's been great I mean it's really,ep016
1557,been awesome having our own place in,ep016
1560,Chicago the original asking price for,ep016
1563,this house was six hundred and fifteen,ep016
1566,thousand dollars and we ended up paying,ep016
1569,six hundred and seven thousand so how,ep016
1572,does any more salt we are still in,ep016
1575,sticker shock definitely about how much,ep016
1578,we had to spend to buy a place here in,ep016
1581,Chicago but now that we're in it almost,ep016
1584,a month now it was well worth it,ep016
1587,especially to be in the neighborhood,ep016
1590,that we wanted to be in absolutely yeah,ep016
1593,that's kind of what I was thinking too I,ep016
1596,feel like we did compromise some for the,ep016
1599,location the three bedrooms being on one,ep016
1602,level were really important to me but,ep016
1605,ultimately I realized Ethan's a teenage,ep016
1608,boy and he will be just fine down there,ep016
1611,by himself Danny gray graceful gray I,ep016
1614,see a lot of great I definitely plan to,ep016
1617,make some changes we plan to get rid of,ep016
1620,the purple wall in the basement that is,ep016
1623,first and foremost we do plan to take,ep016
1626,out the papers in the front yard and put,ep016
1629,down some grass to have a little bit of,ep016
1632,green space here I hope that's level it,ep016
1635,is because I did it I do wake up some,ep016
1638,days and I I just can't believe that I'm,ep016
1641,in Chicago now that the whole family is,ep016
1644,in Chicago this home represents success,ep016
1647,in a way we put roots down here and,ep016
1650,we've bought a place and the kids are,ep016
1653,happy and that makes us really happy,ep016
1656,[Music],ep016

732,No,ep017
735,that's later on are you going to do them,ep017
738,personally no okay then so I would have,ep017
741,to have this done they see the adjacent,ep017
744,laundry room and garage Wow before,ep017
747,checking out the backyard,ep017
750,I look at it got this covered patio,ep017
753,barbecue grill out here,ep017
756,I mean needs a little work probably need,ep017
759,no mess,ep017
762,it needs a lot of work in other words,ep017
765,this grass won't take that long,ep017
768,you got to have an open mind the,ep017
771,backyard it is just really not what I,ep017
774,want I won't make this free back inside,ep017
777,they see the half bath near the stairs,ep017
780,before going up to see the bedrooms,ep017
783,here's my mancave,ep017
786,are you serious load a paint job black,ep017
789,ceiling and the carpet look at this this,ep017
792,carpet is in good condition no it's not,ep017
795,it is indeed changing now they see the,ep017
798,room adjoining the one Lou has staked,ep017
801,out for himself a full bath one more,ep017
804,bedroom maybe I can make this my girl,ep017
807,cave and the master suite wow this is,ep017
810,huge I love this nice and I love the,ep017
813,lighting up here so that's really really,ep017
816,nice here's the master bath nice sized,ep017
819,up yeah this does not have two things,ep017
822,and where's my bling we add bling to it,ep017
825,but look at this huge walk-in closet,ep017
828,even it is B that's enough room in here,ep017
831,for me to move about once I get,ep017
834,everything in here so I got a winner,ep017
837,right here,ep017
840,yes the winner will work well I don't,ep017
843,want to work on anything loo I want to,ep017
846,move in ready does this movie read this,ep017
849,is not this house is exactly what I'm,ep017
852,looking for not granny it does need some,ep017
855,work but the house is under budget and,ep017
858,it's cosmetics just something that's,ep017
861,easy fix,ep017
864,the things that I love about it you have,ep017
867,your room I have mine I love the light,ep017
870,in the master bedroom I love the wood,ep017
873,floors those are some things that I want,ep017
876,in a home,ep017
879,however there's too many little small,ep017
882,things they need to be done can you see,ep017
885,the potential in it just need a little,ep017
888,TLC but when you get to the master,ep017
891,bathroom,ep017
894,it needs total renovation and that just,ep017
897,doesn't work for me,ep017
900,so the Rose finds something she hopes,ep017
903,will work for both of them this isn't a,ep017
906,suburban area for you,ep017
909,20-minute commute for me but everybody's,ep017
912,right on top of each other,ep017
915,[Music],ep017
918,we can give them what to expect when it,ep017
921,comes to the inspection the appraisal,ep017
924,real estate agent and team leader LaRose,ep017
927,and husband Lou who's entering the field,ep017
930,are in the market themselves in Fort,ep017
933,Worth Texas so far they've seen a deluxe,ep017
936,condo downtown for her that was over,ep017
939,their 250 thousand dollar max budget and,ep017
942,a more affordable single-family home for,ep017
945,him it's closer to the 230 thousand,ep017
948,dollar range he'd like so now LaRose is,ep017
951,seeing if a town house she found can,ep017
954,split the difference it's a new,ep017
957,development new construction this isn't,ep017
960,a suburban area for you,ep017
963,20-minute commute for me I like the,ep017
966,landscaping but everybody's right on top,ep017
969,of each other,ep017
972,I hope the backyard is bigger let me,ep017
975,tell you a little bit about the house,ep017
978,how much is it two hundred and forty,ep017
981,thousand on that it's above our budget,ep017
984,not above my budget does it have an HOA,ep017
987,a little small one as 224 that's not,ep017
990,small for one let's go look at it,ep017
993,okay,ep017
996,this is what I wanted you to see so,ep017
999,we're small it has an open concept but,ep017
1002,it's so small for a dining room look at,ep017
1005,the granite countertops and you know,ep017
1008,this is my favorite color,ep017
1011,I'm not a big fan of these white candy,ep017
1014,though you know I wanted a darker,ep017
1017,campaign now one thing what do you think,ep017
1020,about I'm not a big fan of this towel I,ep017
1023,probably would have been better we had,ep017
1026,wood all the way through I know,ep017
1029,notice there is no refrigerator yeah,ep017
1032,that's an expansion we're already above,ep017
1035,budget they see the garage and a half,ep017
1038,bath before making their way upstairs,ep017
1041,we have carpet all upstairs this is a,ep017
1044,little space what does this well,ep017
1047,you know it can be anything that we want,ep017
1050,it to be look they see the bedroom that,ep017
1053,would double as a guest room and private,ep017
1056,retreat for Lou look how big the closet,ep017
1059,I like it's enough for me I love how,ep017
1062,you're thinking yes cuz I don't want to,ep017
1065,be in your closet after checking out the,ep017
1068,second full bathroom it's on to the,ep017
1071,master over here it has big windows I,ep017

1092,I don't want to see him out there,ep017
1095,cutting grass look at my shoes going up,ep017
1098,there color-coordinate all of my things,ep017
1101,all your stuff I love it I want to show,ep017
1104,you the bathroom privacy absolutely well,ep017
1107,we're not worried about it being a,ep017
1110,little tightest,ep017
1113,[Music],ep017
1116,I like that it's a new bill but I don't,ep017
1119,like that it's just a two-bedroom I,ep017
1122,really want a backyard and it's a far,ep017
1125,far cry from the four bedroom that I'm,ep017
1128,looking for what I love about it is its,ep017
1131,low maintenance it is a brand new,ep017
1134,townhome no one's lived in it but the,ep017
1137,master bedroom,ep017
1140,it's open up to the back of my neighbors,ep017
1143,I feel a little uncomfortable about that,ep017
1146,and I don't like that the dining room is,ep017
1149,so small none of their options have,ep017
1152,everything they want so their decision,ep017
1155,may hinge on what matters most high-end,ep017
1158,amenities a suburban backyard or a brand,ep017
1161,new build,ep017
1164,okay so passivating plans coming ah man,ep017
1167,it is a journey,ep017

1173,homes in their 250 thousand dollar max,ep017
1176,budget they're meeting with their,ep017
1179,youngest son to go over their options,ep017
1182,we looked at the coolest condo that was,ep017

1188,beautiful historic building buildings,ep017
1191,"also would it be in 279,000 279 bruh and",ep017

1224,that we did see was a brand new townhome,ep017
1227,"oh okay ready to move in 40,000 and",ep017
1230,everything is connected right next to,ep017

51,differently there's a really nice view,ep018
54,out there I can't see any of Ireland,ep018
57,that they're all I see to the dark fence,ep018
60,I want to do it what our kids are young,ep018
63,why we can still really enjoy this time,ep018
66,in this adventure together what's the,ep018
69,name of this place,ep018
72,[Applause],ep018
75,[Music],ep018
78,after growing up in Italy,ep018
81,my family moved to Michigan and that's,ep018
84,where Peter and I met I'm from Ireland,ep018
87,after we got married we lived in a small,ep018
90,apartment in Rome we were like well what,ep018
93,we gonna do mommy a new house mommy and,ep018
96,daddy you're gonna pick a new house,ep018

102,Houston and I started working and just a,ep018
105,small and accounting and I have pretty,ep018
108,much grown in my career over the last 13,ep018
111,years can we dump them in and then all,ep018
114,of a sudden we have a house two cars two,ep018
117,kids and life has just happened and,ep018
120,exploded in a way that we just didn't,ep018
123,even realize you can get so wrapped up,ep018
126,in that we love getting checks and money,ep018
129,and belongings and things in life and we,ep018
132,just need to put the brakes on and,ep018
135,recognize what's most important in life,ep018
138,here I was gonna be able to fit,ep018
141,everything in Davis I'd always had that,ep018
144,yearning to move back to Ireland,ep018
147,Graystone's working from the very,ep018
150,vibrant city it's a suburb of Dublin,ep018
153,close David is 3 years old and Emma's 2,ep018
156,years old I think they're in a place,ep018
159,right now where to make an international,ep018
162,move would be the right time to do it,ep018
165,because they haven't started school yet,ep018
168,you want to do this right I'm so used to,ep018
171,putting paychecks into our savings and,ep018
174,now it's like okay we're doing the,ep018
177,opposite I'm gonna start drawing on our,ep018
180,savings that's got me a little bit,ep018
183,shaken make sure you guys come visit us,ep018
186,right do you want them to come see us in,ep018
189,Ireland I want to do what our kids are,ep018
192,young how we can still really enjoy this,ep018
195,time and this adventure together they're,ep018
198,gonna come first and we're making this,ep018
201,move because of them you want to do this,ep018
204,right the big risk for me is not doing,ep018
207,it at all great stones is,ep018
210,coastal town south of Dublin and east,ep018
213,coast of Ireland it looks like a little,ep018
216,village when you just arrived and you've,ep018
219,got sheep dotted hills in the background,ep018
222,and beautiful gardens and real houses,ep018
225,that are just full of character what are,ep018
228,we looking for in our house in Ireland,ep018
231,cheap we need something with the lowest,ep018
234,price I don't have a job we've got a,ep018
237,finite budget here so we're wanting,ep018
240,something that's gonna be ah or below,ep018
243,would even be better what is your budget,ep018
246,they three thousand dollars a month well,ep018
249,it depends I mean I would go a little,ep018
252,bit above budget if it meant it was the,ep018
255,right house for us it's very common here,ep018
258,to have townhouses and I definitely want,ep018
261,two detached home bedrooms we're looking,ep018
264,for four bedrooms one for ourselves one,ep018
267,for each of our kids and then a guest,ep018
270,room you need to be walking distance,ep018
273,from the town all right now the driving,ep018
276,is definitely something that's stressing,ep018
279,me out is the idea of driving on the,ep018
282,other side of the car and the other side,ep018
285,of the road so it's just a lot to deal,ep018
288,with so for me it has to be walking,ep018
291,distance and what other specifics garden,ep018
294,definitely for the children to play in,ep018
297,okay I can't promise everything in one,ep018
300,prop Z but I have got all of those,ep018
303,things and I'm going to show you them,ep018
306,today are you ready to take a look yeah,ep018
309,we are we're ready the real estate,ep018
312,market in Graystone's is tough the,ep018
315,population is growing rapidly,ep018
318,particularly as there's so many,ep018
321,international companies in Dublin,ep018
324,people want to move out of the city,ep018
327,there's just not that much available and,ep018
330,particularly something with the size,ep018
333,that they need,ep018
336,ra's gets things going or ways from,ep018
339,Greystone centre but the house is close,ep018
342,to the neighbourhood where Peters grew,ep018
345,up so we call this the modern house,ep018
348,we've got four bedrooms three and a half,ep018
351,bathrooms are you familiar with the,ep018
354,neighborhood yeah this is close right by,ep018
357,where my parents live little concern,ep018
360,because it's a little bit further away,ep018
363,from Graystone's to town itself Drive,ep018
366,yeah that is because we are right on the,ep018
369,money so this is three thousand dollars,ep018
372,per month particularly yes that is,ep018
375,terrifying for me I'm grateful that they,ep018
378,have public transportation because I,ep018
381,don't know how soon I can learn to drive,ep018
384,okay so you can just leave your shoes in,ep018
387,the hallway there the owner asked us to,ep018
390,take them off as it's a new build I want,ep018
393,to live well it's beautiful yeah it is,ep018
396,really nice I love the chandelier it's,ep018
399,so bright and open it's pretty good,ep018
402,these are wood floors these are really,ep018
405,nice I like the Yeller,ep018
408,it's very pretty it just looks,ep018
411,little bit smaller than what yeah it's,ep018
414,true I mean I think we'd have a hard,ep018
417,time potentially fitting their furniture,ep018
420,who to take it all from Houston with us,ep018
423,yeah okay by Irish Sanders this is,ep018
426,actually a pretty big living room also,ep018
429,here not wanting to say you guys are you,ep018
432,might actually have to get used to that,ep018
435,okay yeah love that fireplace that is so,ep018
438,much character yeah right boy opens,ep018
441,through these two doors right here isn't,ep018
444,it yeah it was nice for the kids I can,ep018
447,see them from this space we've got,ep018
450,lovely spacious kitchen all the,ep018
453,appliances here see gas cooker I'll burn,ep018
456,a microwave mm-hmm that's great there's,ep018
459,a love gas you will be using this more I,ep018
462,will yes yeah I love God does it have a,ep018
465,dishwasher it does that's his I can't,ep018
468,see it oh okay perfect,ep018
471,this has it's got a really great kitchen,ep018
474,and those days when the meals aren't,ep018
477,that great I can just go to my parents,ep018
480,house they're really close by only five,ep018
483,minutes from here but we'd be able to,ep018
486,put a gate there the kids yeah I think,ep018
489,would be able to get one in there that,ep018
492,would be great it's kind of steep though,ep018
495,oh wow it's all the cheapening here yeah,ep018
498,lovely and spacious note corridors into,ep018
501,the rooms right yeah no I like it the,ep018
504,master bedroom home when I think yeah,ep018
507,this is really nice and open and bright,ep018
510,and airy yes nice size yeah I can see,ep018
513,the sheep outside look it's really,ep018
516,pretty view instead of probably green,ep018
519,hills do you think we could fit our big,ep018
522,Texas bad right in here um don't know,ep018
525,maybe the side tables might have to go,ep018
528,smaller side tables okay yeah finally,ep018
531,we've got the garden okay so what do you,ep018
534,think about modern house I like it it's,ep018
537,got some nice space in the back here at,ep018
540,the kids could definitely play out here,ep018
543,it's right on budget which is really,ep018
546,great and it doesn't really feel like,ep018
549,there would be a lot to do to kind of,ep018
552,make it home I guess I envisioned it,ep018
555,just a little bit bigger,ep018
558,definitely the neighbors are too close,ep018
561,for me okay for me this has probably,ep018
564,about an 8 out of 10 for me it's,ep018
567,probably a 4 out of 10 I just have,ep018
570,certain standards pretty high standards,ep018
573,obviously you married me oh it's just a,ep018
576,sync on its own yeah,ep018
579,Wow and what circumstance would anyone,ep018
582,be in but I'd have to jump up in the,ep018
585,middle of the night and just start,ep018
588,washing their hands wrongly I envisioned,ep018
591,my life in Ireland a lot calmer just a,ep018
594,slower pace of life it'll be a lot more,ep018
597,family time come on David I'm looking,ep018
600,forward to spend more time two kids so,ep018
603,that's gonna be something that's a huge,ep018
606,change first Peter and Susie Brown,ep018
609,decided that this is the time to leave,ep018
612,home and career in Houston for a,ep018
615,different life you can get so wrapped up,ep018
618,in money and belongings and things in,ep018
621,life and we just need to put the brakes,ep018
624,on and recognize what's most important,ep018
627,in life and I think that's what this,ep018
630,move is about,ep018
633,so with three-year-old David and,ep018
636,two-year-old Emma they've come to find a,ep018
639,home in Graystone's on the Irish coast,ep018
642,where Peter grew up but while Peter's,ep018
645,main concern is price what are we,ep018
648,looking for in our house in Ireland,ep018
651,cheap we need something with the lowest,ep018
654,price I don't have a job we've got a,ep018
657,finite budget Susie has other priorities,ep018
660,the most important item on Susan's wish,ep018
663,list is that it would be a detached,ep018
666,house and then I would have a nice big,ep018
669,back garden house one has lots of Appeal,ep018
672,for Peter I like it it's got some nice,ep018
675,space in the back here the kids could,ep018
678,definitely play out here it's right on,ep018
681,budget which is really great but Susie's,ep018
684,looking for something more I guess I,ep018
687,envisioned it just a little bit bigger,ep018
690,and definitely the neighbors are too,ep018
693,close for me so the next house I'm gonna,ep018
696,bring them closer to the town it's a,ep018
699,family neighborhood but it's over budget,ep018
702,and I'm not sure what Peter's gonna say,ep018
705,and the location was the most important,ep018
708,thing for her so this one's the garden,ep018
711,house wow it's big wow that is beautiful,ep018
714,this is what you look evil yes gorgeous,ep018
717,now we've got six bedrooms two and a,ep018
720,half bathrooms and location do you know,ep018
723,where we are,ep018
726,no are we anywhere close to walking,ep018
729,distance from town five minutes walk ah,ep018
732,to town and to the beach so Wow you may,ep018
735,"not like the price $3,300 per month",ep018
738,that's a bit much but I'll show you okay,ep018
741,great come on in it seems although the,ep018
744,house isn't that's what makes it so,ep018
747,special,ep018
750,yeah maybe I am just wowed looking at,ep018
753,the house from the front it is big and,ep018
756,beautiful it's old but that's what I,ep018
759,love as we pulled in and I looked at the,ep018
762,house I knew that this was gonna be too,ep018
765,expensive,ep018
768,I just wanted to get back in the car,ep018
771,turn and go to the pub it's nice isn't,ep018
774,it,ep018
777,oh look at that door knocker David's,ep018
780,gonna have so much fun nice and spacious,ep018
783,for shoes and coats keep that all out of,ep018
786,the house like it and let's come on,ep018
789,through to another grand lower is,ep018
792,amazing this shape is beautiful now I,ep018
795,absolutely love the view this is the,ep018
798,main living area you can see the garden,ep018
801,from here already that looks amazing,ep018
804,those windows will look really old I,ep018
807,mean that's gonna require some,ep018
810,insulation work to get done well it's an,ep018
813,Edwardian house you're not gonna have,ep018
816,the double glazing that you might be,ep018
819,used to at home that may be just,ep018
822,something to compromise on yeah I don't,ep018
825,we're looking for a lot of projects to,ep018
828,do this is probably keep an open mind,ep018
831,Peter fireplace is amazing did you see,ep018
834,that's marble I do yeah Wow I love it,ep018
837,it's a real country kitchen it's,ep018
840,beautiful so beautiful isn't it and,ep018
843,you've got lovely farmhouse style,ep018
846,cupboards granite work top and the,ep018
849,Belfast sink yeah it's beautiful,ep018
852,I don't like the darkness of the floors,ep018
855,I'd like something a little bit more,ep018
858,clean I do like that it's a little bit,ep018
861,more modern here the granite countertops,ep018
864,seems like this was recently renovated,ep018
867,it is nice there's no gas range though,ep018
870,that is definitely electric yeah it is,ep018
873,gorgeous and bright master bedroom,ep018
876,that's nice what do you think about the,ep018
879,closet space there's a lot of closet,ep018
882,space but it's kind of taking over the,ep018
885,room a little bit I don't like that very,ep018
888,much,ep018
891,I think we might just have to paint it,ep018
894,or something yeah I don't know I think,ep018
897,that's another project on the list and,ep018
900,more money that you're spending again,ep018
903,that we don't have look at the rest okay,ep018
906,this is set up as the guest bedroom but,ep018
909,it's a really good-size bedroom - yeah,ep018
912,what is that it's actually not that,ep018
915,unusual to have a sink in some of the,ep018
918,bedrooms it's just a sink on its own,ep018
921,yeah Wow in what circumstance would,ep018
924,anyone be in but I'd have to jump up in,ep018
927,the middle of the night and just start,ep018
930,washing their hands around Leigh what do,ep018
933,you think of this bathroom it's,ep018
936,renovated but it just doesn't fit in the,ep018
939,house I know it's not in keeping with,ep018
942,the style but at least you have all new,ep018
945,appliances yeah true that's great in on,ep018
948,and recall this a conservatory,ep018
951,okay in the US we call this a sunroom,ep018
954,all right okay lovely so really nice,ep018
957,family room again,ep018
960,and come through to the garden wow it's,ep018
963,gorgeous so I could see the kids playing,ep018
966,out here this would be great now tell me,ep018
969,what you think I love it I think it's,ep018
972,perfect there's a few things I would,ep018
975,change but I love that it's close,ep018
978,proximity to town I love that it has a,ep018
981,country kitchen this conservatory is,ep018
984,amazing it's just gorgeous it's perfect,ep018
987,for me yeah it's a great house it's a,ep018
990,great size it's got a great garden but,ep018
993,it's over priced and it's starting to,ep018
996,feel like it's a bit of a money pit with,ep018
999,all the repairs I potentially might be,ep018
1002,needed Peter don't you think for,ep018
1005,location wise that the price fits this,ep018
1008,and also you're probably going to be,ep018
1011,meeting mums in this area you know,ep018
1014,you're walking distance to the village,ep018
1017,so it might be worth just paying that,ep018
1020,couple of hundred extra per month for,ep018
1023,the next house can you at all possible,ep018
1026,find something that's at or even below,ep018
1029,our budget why do you have something in,ep018
1032,mind,ep018
1035,please they follow me okay I told Roz,ep018
1038,and I are friends I thought she had my,ep018
1041,back and she understood what we need but,ep018
1044,that's obviously gone completely haywire,ep018
1047,at this point Pisa keeps asking for a,ep018
1050,cheaper house now I'm happy to oblige,ep018
1053,there really isn't of you it's all,ep018
1056,defense it's not exactly what I had in,ep018
1059,mind,ep018
1062,I can't see any of Ireland all I see it,ep018
1065,is a dark fence,ep018
1068,I love this Main Street is perfect it,ep018
1071,has everything we need it has all the,ep018
1074,shops restaurants the train station is,ep018
1077,coming up right there we can get,ep018
1080,anywhere on the train I don't want to,ep018
1083,drive look at that candy store that's so,ep018
1086,cool eaters childhood memories help the,ep018
1089,Browns imagine Graystone's is the,ep018
1092,perfect place for their young family we,ep018
1095,picked gray stones because I grew up,ep018
1098,there and that's where a lot of my,ep018
1101,friends are and as we've gone back for,ep018
1104,visits to my family where we've gotten,ep018
1107,to spend some more time with themselves,ep018
1110,that's the real main draw to that area,ep018
1113,no we're actually moving back to live in,ep018
1116,Ireland after being in America we're,ep018
1119,excited to be back here but while they,ep018
1122,agree that gray stones is the right,ep018
1125,location finding the right house isn't,ep018
1128,so easy,ep018
1131,Peter and Susie are actually being,ep018
1134,educated along the tour for Irish homes,ep018
1137,Peter left his job in Texas to make this,ep018
1140,move so staying on budget is priority,ep018
1143,one I like it it's got some nice space,ep018
1146,in the back here the kids could,ep018
1149,definitely play out here it's right on,ep018
1152,budget which is really great but for,ep018
1155,Susy their family home has to offer more,ep018
1158,than a good price it just looks a little,ep018
1161,bit small Roz brought the hunt closer to,ep018
1164,Susie's dream with house - wow that is,ep018
1167,beautiful this is,ep018
1170,yes Peter recognizes its upscale,ep018
1173,features it's a great house it's a great,ep018
1176,size it's got great garden but he sees,ep018
1179,house 2 as a luxury they can't afford,ep018
1182,it's over price on it starting to feel,ep018
1185,like it's a bit of a money pit ok there,ep018
1188,we go,ep018
1191,house three sits in a row of newly built,ep018
1194,semi-detached homes it's close to town,ep018
1197,as a view of the Irish Sea and the,ep018
1200,lowest asking price of the hunt Peter,ep018
1203,keeps asking for a cheaper house now I'm,ep018
1206,happy to oblige but sit there see view,ep018
1209,house okay,ep018
1212,your beautiful view from the living room,ep018
1215,it is beautiful,ep018
1218,although it looks like a row house to me,ep018
1221,this one is semi-detached that's what,ep018
1224,you get for paying a little bit less so,ep018
1227,you are a little bit more compact here,ep018
1230,so what we've got here at the Seaview,ep018
1233,house is four bedrooms two and a half,ep018
1236,bathrooms we've got a garden which is,ep018
1239,west facing and the price you'll be very,ep018
1242,happy,ep018
1245,"is $2,800 per month were there what do",ep018
1248,you think about the neighborhood overall,ep018
1251,there's no quaintness about it it,ep018
1254,doesn't look very Irish to me it looks,ep018
1257,like it could be anywhere I love the sea,ep018
1260,view it's absolutely stunning but I,ep018
1263,don't know it's pretty cookie-cutter to,ep018
1266,me well let's give it a chance and let's,ep018
1269,go see okay you ready to have a look,ep018
1272,well just look I'm ready to sign homes,ep018
1275,are smaller in Europe and it probably is,ep018
1278,a little bit of a culture shock because,ep018
1281,we came from the polar opposite which,ep018
1284,was Texas it's a row house and that's,ep018
1287,not one of the things that I can,ep018
1290,compromise on growing up in Ireland I,ep018
1293,had something like this it was a row,ep018
1296,home I grew up just fine I think the,ep018
1299,kids are gonna be just great growing up,ep018
1302,here as well this little room is so,ep018
1305,lovely and bright and you've got that,ep018
1308,perfect picture window for view that is,ep018
1311,a really nice view there it feels bright,ep018
1314,area here now is this the only living,ep018
1317,space sitting,ep018
1320,it is we don't have a playroom for the,ep018
1323,kids let's keep an open mind,ep018
1326,The Price is Right we got to remember,ep018
1329,that this might be a little bit tough,ep018
1332,let's have a look at the kitchen it has,ep018
1335,a nice countertop and some space there,ep018
1338,for the children to sit but yeah it's,ep018
1341,okay all the appliances are integrated,ep018
1344,you've got the fridge and freezer just,ep018
1347,on the left here that's cool dishwasher,ep018
1350,and then obviously you've got the garden,ep018
1353,here what your thoughts on the view,ep018
1356,there really isn't a view it's all,ep018
1359,defense it's not exactly what I had in,ep018
1362,mind I can't see any of Ireland to there,ep018
1365,all I see it as a dark fence garden,ep018
1368,views not great but I mean are we gonna,ep018
1371,spend all the time just looking out of,ep018
1374,the garden we've got that beautiful sea,ep018
1377,view in front of us Wow these baby gates,ep018
1380,are already installed,ep018
1383,that's one last thing we'd have to do,ep018
1386,definitely makes it easier so you've got,ep018
1389,a nice spacious hallway and you could,ep018
1392,put a little bit more low storage if you,ep018
1395,need it out here I see alright and now,ep018
1398,this one's the master bedroom with an,ep018
1401,absolutely amazing view it's a very,ep018
1404,small bedroom they'll Peter but with,ep018
1407,that view that's gonna make up for a,ep018
1410,look how much it feels expanding at the,ep018
1413,end of the day it's the right price it's,ep018
1416,kind of a big compromise we'd have to,ep018
1419,buy a new bed on the right you've got,ep018
1422,the guest bedroom and I don't let me,ep018
1425,show you the bathroom it's good-sized,ep018
1428,and there's subway tiles are so good,ep018
1431,that's really cool isn't it so just nice,ep018
1434,clean tidy that's a nice view right,ep018
1437,there nice and if you look at our,ep018
1440,neighbors garden you can see what they,ep018
1443,did was about there I mean I think it's,ep018
1446,welcome I like this it has no charm and,ep018
1449,no character and it's too small coming,ep018
1452,out just watch your step there,ep018
1455,okay we've got a west-facing garden so,ep018
1458,you will get the afternoon Sun it's,ep018
1461,actually quite bright now Wow what's,ep018
1464,that noise I hear us unfortunately the,ep018
1467,neighborhood isn't finished yet so you,ep018
1470,will probably have building there for,ep018
1473,one to two years,ep018
1476,it's even worse being up here right now,ep018
1479,I know it's not exactly what you've,ep018
1482,pictured but what do you think about the,ep018
1485,house overall,ep018
1488,all the rooms are too small it doesn't,ep018
1491,have the quaint kind of feel that I,ep018
1494,wanted just isn't gonna work for me and,ep018
1497,really you can't do anything about that,ep018
1500,view but I mean if you think about this,ep018
1503,gorgeous sea view in the front it's just,ep018
1506,not that bad here the price being $200,ep018
1509,under is a really good thing I think,ep018
1512,this is really worth considering I know,ep018
1515,I've got my work cut out for me to sell,ep018
1518,in this but you can try I know this is,ep018
1521,gonna be a tough one,ep018
1524,she wants the best for the kids it has,ep018
1527,everything we need that garden is,ep018
1530,stunning but he's standing firm it's a,ep018
1533,huge garden and a huge price tag,ep018
1536,having two very small children and very,ep018
1539,close page together definitely change,ep018
1542,hard lives I want them to have family,ep018
1545,around and experience life in a family,ep018
1548,setting you're not picking out just a,ep018
1551,house you're picking out a home and we,ep018
1554,want to get it right for our children,ep018
1557,the Browns have moved from Texas to,ep018
1560,Ireland's East Coast for a better,ep018
1563,quality of life my expectations are that,ep018
1566,we're gonna be able to spend obviously a,ep018
1569,lot more time together the hunt began,ep018
1572,with a modern four-bedroom house right,ep018
1575,on budget there's a lot of things in,ep018
1578,there that you really liked remember the,ep018
1581,fireplace that you were crazy for love,ep018
1584,that fireplace there's so much character,ep018
1587,and it's got all those modern appliances,ep018
1590,it does it's a good size it's attached,ep018
1593,and we're right on budget we wouldn't,ep018
1596,spend an extra dollar the problem with,ep018
1599,the modern home for me was it was too,ep018
1602,far away I mean there was no walking,ep018
1605,distance to that home if I start driving,ep018
1608,that might just make things a little bit,ep018
1611,easier with the garden house would be,ep018
1614,seriously going over the budget and I,ep018
1617,don't have a job just yet once I saw,ep018
1620,that house I just thought well there,ep018
1623,couldn't be anything much better than,ep018
1626,this,ep018
1629,what you looking for yes the location is,ep018
1632,perfect it has everything we need that,ep018
1635,garden is stunning is gorgeous I can see,ep018
1638,the kids planet here this would be great,ep018
1641,it's a huge garden and a huge price tag,ep018
1644,if we compromise on the house from now,ep018
1647,we're gonna regret it later because it's,ep018
1650,only a few hundred dollars more a month,ep018
1653,you know I love the sea view for the,ep018
1656,price I mean you just kind of beat it it,ep018
1659,was two hundred dollars lower than what,ep018
1662,we budgeted I love the sea view it's,ep018
1665,absolutely stunning but I don't know,ep018
1668,it's pretty cookie cutter to me it was,ep018
1671,too small the garden was too small and I,ep018
1674,really didn't have much time inside I,ep018
1677,don't think for me it was one that I,ep018
1680,would choose,ep018
1683,[Music],ep018
1686,I just want to make sure that you're,ep018
1689,happy the transferor cross for you and,ep018
1692,the kids is happy and I just don't think,ep018
1695,you're gonna be happy with the Seaview,ep018
1698,home right I agree even though I like,ep018
1701,the price let's scrap it yes thank you I,ep018
1704,really like the modern home I think we,ep018
1707,could be happy there and I think you can,ep018
1710,get over learning the drive I really,ep018
1713,like the garden home the location is,ep018
1716,perfect it has everything we need that,ep018
1719,garden is stunning that's the better,ep018
1722,house for us I think you'll be able to,ep018
1725,find a job and that we can afford that,ep018
1728,house it's not gonna be as stressful as,ep018
1731,you think it just seems like it's gonna,ep018
1734,be too much I mean I really want the,ep018
1737,modern home it's a good size it's,ep018
1740,detached it's got all the plans that you,ep018
1743,want it'd be perfect for the kids and,ep018
1746,it's got a good-sized backyard but I,ep018
1749,know you've got your heart set on that,ep018
1752,garden and probably one of the most,ep018
1755,important decisions of our lives I want,ep018
1758,to make sure we get it right just going,ep018
1761,over budget to me is possibly settings,ep018
1764,up further failure if I don't get a job,ep018
1767,or something doesn't work out for soon,ep018
1770,it is the perfect house for us the,ep018
1773,garden the inside it's big it has lots,ep018
1776,of rooms for the kids it has a guest,ep018
1779,room for my parents to stay if we can,ep018
1782,put forth a couple of hundred dollars,ep018
1785,now it'll be so well worth it in the,ep018
1788,future are you willing to sacrifice some,ep018
1791,of these kind of high-cost services that,ep018
1794,we've been having around our lives if we,ep018
1797,could do that I think we could probably,ep018
1800,rework our budget a little bit of make,ep018
1803,it work,ep018
1806,yes I won't get a pedicures anymore we,ep018
1809,could let some of that stuff go mm-hmm I,ep018
1812,think we could get there without work,ep018
1815,that would work so you're willing to,ep018
1818,compromise I think we can do the extra,ep018
1821,$300 a month so let's pick the garden,ep018
1824,house yes all right that's good I'm so,ep018
1827,excited I mean it's you can I get some,ep018
1830,pancakes from,ep018
1833,alright there's been a big transition,ep018
1836,from Houston to Ireland but I'm so happy,ep018
1839,with the decision we've made I think,ep018
1842,this is a great house for us it's just,ep018
1845,perfect we've got enough space to expand,ep018
1848,that with our family get dressed we go,ep018
1851,play it didn't come in the budget that,ep018
1854,we wanted but those extra few dollars,ep018
1857,was worth it I just seen the smiles in,ep018
1860,the kids face and most important smile,ep018
1863,and Susan's faces being really just,ep018
1866,great it's so great having my,ep018
1869,mother-in-law around to help it makes,ep018
1872,such a big difference to have that,ep018
1875,family support the company that I was,ep018
1878,working with kept me on a part-time,ep018
1881,basis so I can be at home with the kids,ep018
1884,and we're still getting an income in I,ep018
1887,love our kids rooms they turned out,ep018
1890,really cute David we had promised him a,ep018
1893,fire truck bed with a slide and so we,ep018
1896,bought him that and he it was just a,ep018
1899,static what's the name of this place,ep018
1902,great stones it's a great place to bring,ep018
1905,up a family so it's exactly what we had,ep018

18,properties it's three thousand four,ep019
21,hundred and fifty square feet that's,ep019

99,little introverted you know she's a,ep019
102,little bit on the quieter side very,ep019
105,methodical and how she approaches things,ep019
108,and then there's the other side of her,ep019
111,which is the reason an Italian household,ep019

177,kind of anything and everything you,ep019
180,could ever think up here maybe they'll,ep019
183,have something sweet yes some cake you,ep019
186,don't mean I'm always good for cake yeah,ep019
189,we're looking to buy a house now mainly,ep019
192,because we've moved a lot over the last,ep019
195,couple years and we've been in a lot of,ep019
198,apartments and rental homes and they've,ep019
201,been nice they haven't been ours a short,ep019
204,commute to their jobs downtown would be,ep019
207,ideal so they're looking near the city,ep019
210,they're also open to one area a little,ep019
213,farther out the Lake Travis community,ep019
216,since they both like the idea of living,ep019
219,by water because Jenna and I both grew,ep019
222,up near water and we just love being by,ep019
225,water as much as we can I think that,ep019
228,would be,ep019
231,this one's definitely that Spanish,ep019
234,Mediterranean style I like with arches,ep019
237,you have your balcony,ep019
240,Milan car says what are you supposed to,ep019
243,do on this balcony like is is that,ep019
246,hopper like you just do Shakespeare have,ep019
249,a cup of coffee growing up on the East,ep019
252,Coast there really wasn't anything that,ep019
255,looked like a Spanish Mediterranean,ep019
258,style house very different very unique,ep019
261,makes me feel that I'm definitely in the,ep019
264,salsa what I was hoping for is something,ep019
267,kind of like a loft type feel or even,ep019
270,like a industrial where you have the,ep019
273,open brick but just more of a kind of a,ep019
276,cleaner look to it that's like the cool,ep019
279,fun space that you work at but not where,ep019
282,you like live the home has to have at,ep019
285,least three bedrooms and two baths and,ep019
288,Cory wants an additional room for a,ep019
291,dedicated office if I can do work in the,ep019
294,peace and quiet and Jenn doesn't have to,ep019
297,worry about me hanging around her on the,ep019
300,couch with my laptop open she's all,ep019
303,about a formal dining room I come from a,ep019
306,very large Italian family we would,ep019
309,always do Christmases Thanksgivings,ep019
312,together I'm just having that fate would,ep019
315,be nice for one family would come over,ep019
318,this one looks like very regal like I,ep019
321,feel like we would host the Queen I,ep019
324,should come over and have dinner with us,ep019
327,I would love to have a large kitchen I,ep019
330,love to cook so we can have all of our,ep019
333,friends and families over for the,ep019
336,holidays the kitchen also needs to be,ep019
339,updated with stainless steel appliances,ep019
342,and a large center island now that's,ep019
345,definitely what I'm looking for and not,ep019
348,to be forgotten is a spacious yard for,ep019
351,their husky pie boy,ep019
354,he was found in Delaware wandering the,ep019
357,street we found him kind of fell in love,ep019
360,with him right away you know he's been a,ep019
363,integral part of our life since we've,ep019
366,been together,ep019
369,sorry buddy I didn't get a for you I,ep019
372,know maybe we'll give you a little taste,ep019
375,later when you kind of look at the,ep019
378,Austin market to be competitive and to,ep019
381,hopefully get something that has a lot,ep019
384,of the things that we're looking for,ep019
387,my guess is we'll probably end up having,ep019
390,to fall somewhere in the 400 or 450,ep019
393,thousand range but I'm just more,ep019
396,comfortable staying for us first up they,ep019
399,head out to the Lake Travis area to see,ep019
402,something their broker hopes Jen likes,ep019
405,so this community in particular just,ep019
408,happens to have a lot of spanish-style,ep019
411,houses so if you're particularly wanting,ep019
414,a spanish-style this is kind of the,ep019
417,community you're gonna be looking in we,ep019
420,are really close to the lake which is,ep019
423,really nice but Brook this is about as,ep019
426,polar-opposite as we did from what I was,ep019
429,asking so well we got to give Jen a,ep019
432,little bit of what you,ep019
435,right yeah so this house is a,ep019
438,three-bedroom two-bathroom and it's well,ep019
441,under budget at 375 Thanks oh good start,ep019
444,yeah let's check it out perfect come on,ep019
447,Wow,ep019
450,so it definitely still has that Spanish,ep019
453,Mediterranean feel on the inside of you,ep019
456,look at the archways and everything and,ep019
459,I mean the doors pretty cool for me I,ep019
462,was looking for something with a little,ep019
465,bit more character a little bit more,ep019
468,fuel of kind of downtown of a design,ep019
471,architecture that comes with that I mean,ep019
474,you see you have your fireplace which is,ep019
477,definitely important it was brutal bare,ep019
480,winters here in Central Texas yeah so it,ep019
483,looks like that I don't get a dining,ep019
486,room in this house no formal dining room,ep019
489,you do have like the breakfast area over,ep019
492,here it probably is big enough to fit a,ep019
495,full-size table yeah I mean you,ep019
498,definitely have enough space even with,ep019
501,the bay window it kind of gives it a,ep019
504,little bit extra but you kind of like it,ep019
507,looks like a galley kitchen that we have,ep019
510,here and I don't see the island you're,ep019
513,looking for yeah I don't know if it's,ep019
516,the big grand kitchen that I was hoping,ep019
519,for but at least this amount of,ep019
522,countertop space which is nice we have,ep019
525,all the stainless steel appliances which,ep019
528,is good definitely an upgrade,ep019
531,no it'll be nicer finishes last,ep019
534,materials so that is one less expense,ep019
537,potentially we would be looking at oh,ep019
540,[Music],ep019
543,wow I mean this is definitely a big,ep019
546,patio porch area which is really nice we,ep019
549,could even close this in if we wanted to,ep019
552,make it like a really nice screened-in,ep019
555,porch yeah you like how this is elevated,ep019
558,up it kind of looks over the backyard,ep019
561,I'm not sure how your thoughts on this,ep019
564,but it's clearly sloped into our,ep019
567,neighbor's yard yeah I mean it would be,ep019
570,a little tricky hopefully all the water,ep019
573,we draining into our neighbor's yard,ep019
576,back inside they peek in on a guest bath,ep019
579,and bed before looking at the second,ep019
582,spare room yeah I would probably office,ep019
585,just because they're only two extra,ep019
588,bedrooms I don't know if we would have a,ep019
591,designated office I mean with kids in,ep019
594,the future people coming to visit if we,ep019
597,were to buy this house I think we would,ep019
600,have to convert one of the bedrooms into,ep019
603,an office it's gonna limit us greatly,ep019
606,with regards to space as we grow and,ep019
609,have a family I think we both have to,ep019
612,compromise a little bit on square,ep019
615,footage but it is the style that I was,ep019
618,looking for so again that may just be a,ep019
621,compromise they crossed through the,ep019
624,living room to the master and in this,ep019
627,nice - that there's doors to go right,ep019
630,out to the balcony,ep019
633,yeah and window treatments I'm not too,ep019
636,fond of uses change oh wow double vanity,ep019
639,which is nice,ep019
642,the thinks are different that's I've,ep019
645,never seen that type of thing before,ep019
648,finishings are definitely nice I'm not,ep019
651,sure if they're a hundred percent our,ep019
654,style mm-hmm,ep019
657,I'm not sure how you feel about this,ep019
660,yeah I mean that's not ideal the fact,ep019
663,that the toilets it's just blindly,ep019
666,opened in the middle of the bathroom,ep019
669,conveniently next to the bathtub in the,ep019
672,shower,ep019
675,to me that just seems like a goofy,ep019
678,layout and just a lot of visibility,ep019
681,issues I felt like a circle curtain or,ep019
684,something right around the toilet it's,ep019
687,definitely that Spanish Mediterranean,ep019
690,look that I was going for,ep019
693,um location wise I mean it would be,ep019
696,great we're out by the lake but this was,ep019
699,really not my style and then you know we,ep019
702,only have two additional bedrooms here,ep019
705,outside of the master both are small,ep019
708,spaces and so you gotta think about it,ep019
711,once one of those becomes an office I,ep019
714,mean if we have kids in the future and,ep019
717,we're gonna we're gonna have gross space,ep019
720,pretty quickly yeah it is a nice,ep019
723,backyard good space for the kids,ep019
726,potentially to play in the future and,ep019
729,for kind of have right now it is way,ep019
732,under budget for both of us so that,ep019
735,would be great I mean we would still,ep019
738,potentially have some money left over to,ep019
741,change the things we wanted right away,ep019
744,you know ideally if we can I'd love to,ep019
747,see a property closer to downtown Austin,ep019
750,a little bit more my style and again my,ep019
753,little bit bigger as well you know this,ep019
756,is just gonna look nice,ep019
759,[Music],ep019
762,so Brooke lines up a property,ep019
765,tailor-made for Corey I mean I love this,ep019
768,Brooke it has definitely the clean,ep019
771,design and look feel to it gorgeous day,ep019
774,out this is the down here Jana and Cory,ep019
777,just moved to Austin Texas and they're,ep019
780,looking for their first home with a four,ep019
783,hundred and fifty thousand dollar max,ep019
786,budget so far they've seen a home in one,ep019
789,of their preferred areas Lake Travis,ep019
792,listed for three hundred and,ep019
795,seventy-five thousand dollars it's the,ep019
798,Spanish style she really wants but it,ep019
801,lacks the hip modern vibe he likes so,ep019
804,today their brokers found a house that's,ep019
807,more Corey's taste close to downtown I,ep019
810,mean I love this Brooke it has,ep019
813,definitely the metal siding the clean,ep019
816,design and look feel to it and what is,ep019
819,that noise I'm hearing above us right,ep019
822,now these are just the bugs in Texas,ep019
825,welcome to Texas guys so this house is a,ep019
828,four-bedroom two-bathroom house and it's,ep019
831,listed at 470,ep019
834,Wow yeah a little bit over budget it's a,ep019
837,little over budget but if you want to be,ep019
840,really close to downtown and have the,ep019
843,modern style that Cory you're really,ep019
846,wanting then this is probably the price,ep019
849,range that you're gonna be sitting in,ep019
852,well I'm excited so all right yeah I,ep019
855,mean it's definitely not my style at all,ep019
858,it's a very modern no good to see what,ep019
861,the inside looks like maybe give it a,ep019
864,chance but from the outside I don't know,ep019
867,[Music],ep019
870,Brooke this is exactly what I was,ep019
873,looking for the modern cool new house,ep019
876,for sure everything's just modern clean,ep019
879,look clean crisp feel to it it has you,ep019
882,know subway tiles which kind of looks,ep019
885,like exposed brick so so far it looks,ep019
888,like dude this is kind of the only place,ep019
891,that we would eat no dining room no,ep019
894,formal dining room but there is enough,ep019
897,room here for a full sized dining room,ep019
900,table and it looks like two in the,ep019
903,kitchen they have some seats around the,ep019
906,island yeah I mean it's and it's a large,ep019
909,island which I know you really were,ep019
912,hoping for so I think that's a bonus I,ep019
915,miss you my only concern just with this,ep019
918,being all white I don't know how easy it,ep019
921,is to stain I kind of make a mess,ep019
924,sometimes when I'm cooking I do love the,ep019
927,the subway tile look I,ep019
930,it's a great contrast with that and then,ep019
933,kind of a clean crisp look of the,ep019
936,kitchen with white cabinets stainless,ep019
939,steel just it has that industrial modern,ep019
942,kind of feel to it it seems to really,ep019
945,resonate well with what I'm looking for,ep019
948,alright well let's go check out the,ep019
951,bedrooms just go down the hall right,ep019
954,here they look in on two guest rooms oh,ep019
957,cool it's a nice little bedroom Jenna,ep019
960,and a bath before seeing the third spare,ep019
963,bedroom I think it's questionable they,ep019
966,actually call us a bedroom okay thanks,ep019
969,it's a it's a tight space it's small,ep019
972,space it would be good for an office,ep019
975,that looks like a door out to the,ep019
978,backyard which is nice so this may be,ep019
981,something to work I can just have his,ep019
984,stuff and maybe this is his room it's,ep019
987,really tiny yeah this would be really,ep019
990,nice not functional for Kai I mean I,ep019
993,guess the one nice thing there really,ep019
996,isn't anybody behind us so we do have,ep019
999,lots of privacy all right I don't know,ep019
1002,yeah back inside they head to the master,ep019
1005,suite so definitely a good-size room,ep019
1008,it's a very bland just kind of sterile,ep019
1011,feeling here so I would definitely Pye,ep019
1014,want to add some color to the wall give,ep019
1017,it maybe a little bit of a more tranquil,ep019
1020,fuel than kind of the sterile white wall,ep019
1023,that's here let's look at the master,ep019
1026,master bathroom so we have double,ep019
1029,vanities which is nice some nice detail,ep019
1032,work with the subway tile yeah I mean,ep019
1035,the subway sounds nice but a bathroom,ep019
1038,it's a little bit on the smaller side,ep019
1041,yeah that's shoot I mean,ep019
1044,it's updated finishings it looks great,ep019
1047,but outside of that you know it's just,ep019
1050,to me it's a standard map,ep019
1053,I mean obviously it really is an,ep019
1056,industrial more modern look and feel,ep019
1059,that I'm looking for the modern look and,ep019
1062,feel of the house that's actually kind,ep019
1065,of growing on me,ep019
1068,I do like it Cory still has an office so,ep019
1071,it's probably a pretty good layout for,ep019
1074,us unfortunately with this house we,ep019
1077,don't have a dining room we do have a,ep019
1080,really big kitchen which is great with a,ep019
1083,really nice Island so that would be,ep019
1086,great for cooking and entertaining my,ep019
1089,baby he's concerned not right off the,ep019
1092,bat it's just the price it's way over my,ep019
1095,budget it's even over Cory's commute,ep019
1098,wise I'd only be a few minutes from the,ep019
1101,office which is ideal I do have concerns,ep019
1104,with the backyard you know that I was,ep019
1107,just hoping we're getting all the more,ep019
1110,yard yeah that's definitely true I mean,ep019
1113,the house is move-in ready,ep019
1116,you really don't need to do anything,ep019
1119,here which is great so again more things,ep019
1122,to take into consideration not convinced,ep019
1125,they head out to look at another house,ep019
1128,but it may be more than what they want,ep019
1131,it's three thousand four hundred and,ep019
1134,fifty square feet that's massive,ep019
1137,[Music],ep019
1140,careful for cactus especially with them,ep019
1143,these newlyweds are looking to make,ep019
1146,their recent move to Austin Texas,ep019
1149,permanent by buying a house with their,ep019
1152,four hundred and fifty thousand dollar,ep019
1155,max budget so far they've seen a,ep019
1158,well-priced spanish-style for Jan in the,ep019
1161,Lake Travis area but its size meant,ep019
1164,they'd have to forfeit a guest room for,ep019
1167,Cory's office then they saw a modern,ep019
1170,style home much closer to downtown that,ep019
1173,fits his style and did have the extra,ep019
1176,room for an office but they both felt,ep019
1179,the yard might be too small for their,ep019
1182,dog Kai and it was over budget today,ep019
1185,they're seeing a home farther out in,ep019
1188,Cedar Park it's about 40 minutes from,ep019
1191,downtown I'm 20 from Lake Travis,ep019
1194,definitely not the Spanish Mediterranean,ep019
1197,I mean it does have the arches which I,ep019
1200,guess is one good part and I do really,ep019
1203,like that limestone it kind of gives us,ep019
1206,that Texas feel I said I wanted exposed,ep019
1209,brick you know I appreciate the,ep019
1212,opportunity here but it's not exactly,ep019
1215,what I was looking for right so this is,ep019
1218,a more traditional style home listed at,ep019
1221,434 so it's a little closer to your,ep019
1224,price range since djinns it's three,ep019
1227,thousand four hundred and fifty square,ep019
1230,feet that's massive it's definitely a,ep019
1233,large house I just don't know if it's,ep019
1236,gonna be too much for us it's a lot to,ep019
1239,clean and maintain oh wow look at this,ep019
1242,holy cow this place goes on and on yeah,ep019
1245,I mean look at all the arches it's kind,ep019
1248,of just finished Mediterranean feel,ep019
1251,almost what room is this boring right,ep019
1254,now so this is the formal living room,ep019
1257,and that's the formal dining room I'm,ep019
1260,not really sure what we would do with a,ep019
1263,formal living room space but I mean just,ep019
1266,because it's so open to the dining room,ep019
1269,that'd be great for if we do get the,ep019
1272,whole family here oh I think you can,ep019
1275,probably a gigantic table in here this,ep019
1278,space right now for dinner oh my,ep019
1281,goodness look at the size of this,ep019
1284,kitchen oh it counts huge on the,ep019
1287,countertop space I'd be perfect I mean,ep019
1290,that's a lot of cabinets and this is,ep019
1293,like a sieve blandness this is something,ep019
1296,I think they put in houses like in the,ep019
1299,90s it's definitely not the style that,ep019
1302,I'm looking for it I don't know if we'd,ep019
1305,have to update everything in here that,ep019
1308,would be a lot of money it's got to be a,ep019
1311,fortune and upgrade all the amenities it,ep019
1314,could be very pricey because of the size,ep019
1317,of the kitchen yeah,ep019
1320,oh my goodness honey look at this look,ep019
1323,at this backyard look at the size of,ep019
1326,this pool oh my goodness this is a nice,ep019
1329,little surprise Wow and you've got some,ep019
1332,great green space over here,ep019
1335,tons of grass for him to run around now,ep019
1338,awesome I was gonna ask you about that,ep019
1341,you know obviously the pool is fantastic,ep019
1344,but where would I have space time honey,ep019
1347,but that's great yeah,ep019
1350,seer Park is a lot further than we are,ep019
1353,hoping to be however when you step foot,ep019
1356,into that backyard and you have the pool,ep019
1359,in the waterfall running it takes you,ep019
1362,out of just the concern of being in one,ep019
1365,location now there it becomes your own,ep019
1368,tropical oasis back inside they had to,ep019
1371,see the home office this is a good,ep019
1374,little space oh wow yeah no there's,ep019
1377,definitely lots of room my only concern,ep019
1380,is you have white walls white ceiling,ep019
1383,white doors I feel like I've gotten was,ep019
1386,like a hospital room they head down the,ep019
1389,hall and see three guest rooms and a,ep019
1392,bath before taking a look at the master,ep019
1395,suite look at this space this is right,ep019
1398,master it is actually it looks like you,ep019
1401,have access out to the backyard from our,ep019
1404,bedroom which is really cool nice you've,ep019
1407,got a really large master bathroom oh,ep019
1410,wow look at the size of this closet,ep019
1413,right here to my right eye bubble sure,ep019
1416,is prob about the same size of my,ep019
1419,brother's apartment in San Francisco the,ep019
1422,counters cabinets everything is kind of,ep019
1425,outdated,ep019
1428,I just don't know again budget wise what,ep019
1431,it would be to redo the whole bathroom,ep019
1434,that's definitely adding up lots of,ep019
1437,dollar signs it's definitely not a loft,ep019
1440,it's definitely not industrial it's not,ep019
1443,the Mediterranean Spanish look you're,ep019
1446,looking for its proximity it's not near,ep019
1449,what we were looking at Rijal you that's,ep019
1452,true I mean it's a huge sprawling house,ep019
1455,I feel like it's almost maybe a little,ep019
1458,bit too much of a house for us yeah the,ep019
1461,nice part though is there was a separate,ep019
1464,area for a office and for the dining,ep019
1467,room,ep019
1470,we can fit all of our friends and family,ep019
1473,in here the backyard is great there's,ep019
1476,definitely space for the dog with the,ep019
1479,side yard there's the pool the,ep019
1482,landscaping which is amazing but that is,ep019
1485,also something new for listen there's,ep019
1488,gonna be ice associated with the,ep019
1491,maintenance of a pool I mean it was a,ep019
1494,gorgeous expansive kitchen but there's,ep019
1497,gonna be upgrades that we have to do in,ep019
1500,there the bathrooms will probably be,ep019
1503,upgraded we're already a little bit,ep019
1506,above where you wanted to be budget wise,ep019
1509,and we're getting close to my maximum,ep019
1512,capacity so we just have to think - this,ep019
1515,could be a pretty decent investment in,ep019
1518,here,ep019
1521,time we'd have to see if that would be,ep019
1524,worth it or not and just what makes one,ep019
1527,of these homes worth it might boil down,ep019
1530,to one of them getting their style space,ep019
1533,for a dining room or being in one of,ep019
1536,their desired locations we essentially,ep019
1539,going to lose a property if we don't,ep019
1542,make a decision quickly,ep019
1545,what you thinking so many good choices,ep019
1548,Cory and Jen are looking to put down,ep019
1551,roots in Austin Texas they've seen,ep019
1554,several options now they have to choose,ep019
1557,the spanish-style house we saw up by,ep019
1560,Luke Travis the sticker price on that,ep019
1563,house was 375 it's only had two guest,ep019
1566,bedrooms I know you really wanted an,ep019
1569,office so we'd have to use one of those,ep019
1572,for that and then there's no dining room,ep019
1575,for me there is a small kitchen area,ep019
1578,that's a house that we can move right,ep019
1581,into which is free this is well under,ep019
1584,our budget we have the opportunity there,ep019
1587,if we want to make some modifications,ep019
1590,the house I know it's a hundred percent,ep019
1593,of style that you're looking for it did,ep019
1596,have a nice backyard yeah that's,ep019
1599,definitely true it's nice and it's very,ep019
1602,convenient that is by Lake Travis which,ep019
1605,you know you know I'd love to be close,ep019
1608,to water if we can and then we saw what,ep019
1611,the industrial modern type home which,ep019
1614,was definitely hundreds of my style,ep019
1617,modern interior actually kind of grew on,ep019
1620,me I did like a lot of the features that,ep019
1623,it had I wouldn't really want to paint,ep019
1626,that house though it's very bland I,ep019
1629,really liked the kitchen,ep019
1632,there was no dining room unfortunately,ep019
1635,but it did have some seating at the,ep019
1638,island because it was so large the,ep019
1641,backyard was super small yeah I mean at,ep019
1644,least in that house we had three,ep019
1647,bedrooms and the master so you had an,ep019
1650,office but just that sticker price for,ep019
1653,that house yeah I mean the convenience,ep019
1656,is it is much closer to work yeah that's,ep019
1659,true you know the traditional home was,ep019
1662,on Cedar Park that's way further out,ep019
1665,than you and I ever were intending to,ep019
1668,live it wasn't a spanish-style home or,ep019
1671,Mediterranean style oh it was definitely,ep019
1674,not industrial loft or modern sajo but,ep019
1677,you know that backyard was incredible,ep019
1680,the backyard is gorgeous that house is a,ep019
1683,little,ep019
1686,over my budget I know it's still within,ep019
1689,yours that one even has a nice big,ep019
1692,dining room the kitchen and the,ep019
1695,bathrooms weren't really exactly what we,ep019
1698,were looking for so again that's gonna,ep019
1701,be more cost I mean that house has more,ep019
1704,space than I think we know what to do,ep019
1707,with I'm not sure how much it would cost,ep019
1710,to heat cool that house we potentially,ep019
1713,going to lose a property if we don't,ep019
1716,make a decision quickly so what are your,ep019
1719,thoughts hey may come as a surprise to,ep019
1722,you but I think that traditional so,ep019
1725,we're going with the traditional I think,ep019
1728,so the beautiful pool it really has,ep019
1731,everything that we're looking for we're,ep019
1734,gonna be able to grow into that house,ep019
1737,and not have to worry about a couple,ep019
1740,years down the road best bang for our,ep019
1743,buck awesome,ep019
1746,well Cheers everything we've been in the,ep019
1749,house now in just under a month and you,ep019
1752,know we're still getting settled we're,ep019
1755,still tryna still try to find stuff it's,ep019
1758,definitely a much bigger kitchen than,ep019
1761,where you see that's for sure I know not,ep019
1764,being able to get the industrial loft,ep019
1767,that I was looking for it was a little,ep019
1770,bit disappointing but it is a nice house,ep019
1773,did check off a lot of boxes are the,ep019
1776,things that I was really looking for I,ep019
1779,did have to give up the Spanish,ep019
1782,Mediterranean style that I was hoping,ep019
1785,for,ep019
1788,it does have some arches which kind of,ep019
1791,plays into that but this house has,ep019
1794,definitely a large kitchen it's not,ep019
1797,exactly updated but it's definitely,ep019
1800,something we can kind of invest in and,ep019
1803,change down the road I think the thing,ep019
1806,that sold me the most on this house was,ep019
1809,really just the fact that we're gonna be,ep019
1812,able to grow into this space whether we,ep019
1815,had more dogs or our children in the,ep019
1818,future it definitely has the flexibility,ep019
1821,to really allow us to expand as a family,ep019
1824,I think after dinner maybe we should get,ep019
1827,some more paint supplies yeah definitely,ep019
1830,sounds like a good idea really the only,ep019
1833,main thing that we've changed so far in,ep019
1836,our house is painting the office I know,ep019
1839,when we first got here it was just very,ep019
1842,white very bling so it's not very green,ep019
1845,you know there definitely are the,ep019
1848,bathrooms that we want to change the,ep019
1851,update that's just something we're gonna,ep019
1854,get to over time I'm not opposed to blue,ep019
1857,I think we gotta tone it down a little,ep019
1860,bit maybe pick one color yeah we are,ep019
1863,definitely greatly enjoying the pool and,ep019
1866,kind really has done great adjusting he,ep019
1869,still has a side yard to run and play,ep019
1872,okay here we go for us this was a pretty,ep019
1875,substantial investment both personally,ep019
1878,but obviously financially as well and it,ep019
1881,is really our Oasis so it's something,ep019
1884,we're not looking to leave anytime in,ep019
1887,the near future,ep019
1890,what's your Sonny this is our our house,ep019
1893,now yep just be careful with the glass,ep019
1896,room,ep019
12,Wow this is a great room Stacy and Paige,ep020
15,need more space if they're going to have,ep020
18,kids soon love that you can see into the,ep020
21,other rooms it's really good for,ep020
24,entertaining or for kids you can see,ep020
27,them from the kitchen but her priority,ep020
30,is a formal dining space this is our,ep020
33,wasted room that we won't use this is,ep020
36,great and he's more focused on a garage,ep020
39,although third star third stall that's,ep020
42,right,ep020
45,they'll have to find common ground this,ep020
48,is the dining space this space is,ep020
51,perfect for this house hunt could go up,ep020
54,in smoke we can just replace that with a,ep020
57,gas insert that's a lot of work and a,ep020
60,lot of money that we wouldn't have,ep020
63,sausage,ep020
66,[Music],ep020
69,when the Falls are full yeah my name is,ep020
72,Stacy Harrison I'm a behavior specialist,ep020
75,at a elementary school my name is paige,ep020
78,harmon i am a radiology technologist and,ep020
81,I work at out orthopedic clinic here in,ep020
84,town,ep020
87,Brittany about there and then I'm gonna,ep020
90,bring this big camera over your head we,ep020
93,were set up by Stacie's cousin we were,ep020
96,working together in x-ray school and she,ep020
99,just had kind of mentioned him to me and,ep020
102,his sister was trying to set him up at,ep020
105,the same time from the other side so I,ep020
108,agreed to it I said this is gonna be the,ep020
111,last one though I don't want to do any,ep020
114,more setups I remember you telling me,ep020
117,right away from your first day that,ep020
120,you're like I think he's the one who's,ep020
123,thinking he's the real deal,ep020
126,when I got home my roommate Doug said,ep020
129,how did it go he said well I can't screw,ep020
132,this one up,ep020
135,not even two years later we got married,ep020
138,I love Sioux Falls because it's it's,ep020
141,bigger city but it's got kind of a small,ep020
144,community feel to it go downtown quite a,ep020
147,bit they got some cool breweries and,ep020
150,wineries down there and we just like to,ep020
153,hang out with friends we should do like,ep020
156,a yearly couple trip yes we'll go,ep020
159,downtown for walks Falls Park we can do,ep020
162,a lot of antiquing Oh safe this exactly,ep020
165,matches the one I have at home and they,ep020
168,enjoy personalizing the vintage items,ep020
171,they find so it's kind of something we,ep020
174,do together it's just kind of the,ep020
177,painting end of it or I might be more,ep020
180,about putting it together,ep020
183,yeah like throw you de-stressed away,ep020
186,yeah our first house we didn't really,ep020
189,think before we bought it we just kind,ep020
192,of bought it our plan was kind of to,ep020
195,stay there for up to five years we made,ep020
198,it two and a half and then we decided,ep020
201,it's time for something bigger as we get,ep020
204,more serious about having a family so,ep020
207,this next house will definitely be our,ep020
210,forever home I like the price for this,ep020
213,"one though our max budget is 250,000",ep020
216,all the bedrooms on the same level same,ep020
219,as the living room,ep020
222,so like a ranch would be best for me I'm,ep020
225,opposite of that I don't want a ranch I,ep020
228,like to have at least two floors,ep020
231,I like the Victorian style homes I like,ep020
234,the towers and the turrets and the,ep020
237,intricate woodwork and I would like at,ep020
240,least three three-bedroom three-bathroom,ep020
243,I don't know if we need much more than,ep020
246,that,ep020
249,I honestly don't want to look at,ep020
252,anything less than four bedrooms we have,ep020
255,family that lives out of town I would,ep020
258,just really like a room and kind of a,ep020
261,little bit of a separate area for them,ep020
264,rooms are pretty separate and there's a,ep020
267,formal dining so that's good I don't,ep020
270,think the formal dining room is,ep020
273,necessary I feel like it's a room that,ep020
276,is there for her to decorate but we,ep020
279,would rarely use and I totally disagree,ep020
282,I would love a formal dining space,ep020
285,someday when we have kids I want to take,ep020
288,him away from the TV and sit down by the,ep020
291,table and have family suppers I don't,ep020
294,like the color of the cabinets though,ep020
297,white everything would be my ideal,ep020
300,kitchen I don't want an open floor plan,ep020
303,though because otherwise I feel like,ep020
306,it's just one big open space and you,ep020
309,throw a rug in this corner and you call,ep020
312,it the living room and you throw it over,ep020
315,here and you call it the dining room I,ep020
318,would like to be open I like having a,ep020
321,living dining kitchen all together as,ep020
324,one that's cute that's a small garage,ep020
327,though I would love to have a,ep020
330,three-stall garage we only have two,ep020
333,vehicles but I've got a lot of tools I,ep020
336,would love to have a big private,ep020
339,backyard and then ideally I would have a,ep020
342,finished basement and since he's six,ep020
345,foot seven he's hoping to find one with,ep020
348,a high ceiling I would love to have a,ep020
351,wood-burning fireplace I love the,ep020
354,ambience they bring and I love the smell,ep020
357,of them but I prefer gas just because,ep020
360,wood I feel like it makes your house,ep020
363,smell and it gets smoky and it's a lot,ep020
366,of work I would love a soaker tub just,ep020
369,somewhere I can come relax after a,ep020
372,stressful day at work and you kind of,ep020
375,have my me time my page time my goal for,ep020
378,this house hunt is to really find our,ep020
381,cozy forever home and something that we,ep020
384,can be proud to own first up their,ep020
387,real-estate agents found a place that's,ep020
390,closer to Stacy style than pages we got,ep020
393,"a four-bedroom house here it's got 2,300",ep020
396,and 49 square feet and it's priced at,ep020
399,234 thousand nine hundred dollars I,ep020
402,brought Stacy page to this house because,ep020
405,I felt like this house had,ep020
408,a lot of what Stacy wanted with the,ep020
411,two-story Victorian feel I was hoping it,ep020
414,would be a little more of a Victorian,ep020
417,home but I do like that it's a double,ep020
420,saw garage at least I really wanted to,ep020
423,see a ranch and it was that two-story,ep020
426,that I'm not really looking for so it,ep020
429,wasn't the best first impression you'd,ep020
432,have to change that do you think this,ep020
435,room kind of gives you that wow factor,ep020
438,with the tall ceilings yeah I wish it,ep020
441,was more hardwood floor throughout all,ep020
444,here but we can work with carpet I,ep020
447,really like the carpet I think it makes,ep020
450,the living room nice and cozy we can,ep020
453,always swap it out if we decide well,ep020
456,we'll see,ep020
459,nice big fireplace - that's great and,ep020
462,it's gas so that's perfect I kind of,ep020
465,wanted a wood fireplace but this'll work,ep020
468,this is your formal dining area wait,ep020
471,this is our wasted room that we won't,ep020
474,use oh this is great I'm not a fan of a,ep020
477,formal dining room because I feel like,ep020
480,we'd use it twice a year at most and the,ep020
483,rest the time is just unused he thinks,ep020
486,we're not gonna use it very much but I,ep020
489,don't want to be sitting in front of the,ep020
492,TV eating supper every night over here's,ep020
495,the kitchen this is nice it's okay it's,ep020
498,definitely not my white kitchen I don't,ep020
501,like the oak cabinets and I don't like,ep020
504,the blue countertops I'm really looking,ep020
507,for a white updated kitchen I would love,ep020
510,stone countertops and I feel like the,ep020
513,flow and the function of this kitchen,ep020
516,just is an ideal for me oh so there's,ep020
519,our half bath that's nice and the,ep020
522,laundry right around the corner it's,ep020
525,nice to have that on the menu name,ep020
528,flooring what's this store behind us,ep020
531,oh nice oh this is great it's not the,ep020
534,three stall garage I wanted but it's got,ep020
537,a workbench I'm probably asking for a,ep020
540,little too much asking for a three-stall,ep020
543,garage but if Erin can find a house for,ep020
546,us with one that would be great,ep020
549,you got a nice little patio but it's,ep020
552,definitely not big mitts definitely not,ep020
555,private you know if you look over your,ep020
558,side yard oh that's quite spacious and,ep020
561,does have some pine trees I hate those,ep020
564,pine trees that kill the grass and I,ep020
567,just don't like the look of them not a,ep020
570,fan of the pine trees outside I know we,ep020
573,can rip them out if we want but that's,ep020
576,just more work than I'm looking for it's,ep020
579,gonna be very difficult to find a home,ep020
582,without pine trees in South Dakota,ep020
585,here's the basement the fireplace,ep020
588,another fire gives us a second living,ep020
591,space which is some cozy one in so and,ep020
594,we got a bedroom around the corner,ep020
597,absolutely we got a nice big spacious,ep020
600,bedroom yes thanks these are some crazy,ep020
603,colors not sure what they're thinking,ep020
606,but it is a big room,ep020
609,but this would work pretty good for any,ep020
612,lost weight I think there's a another,ep020
615,bathroom here for in-laws - oh thanks,ep020
618,upstairs they peek into the two guest,ep020
621,bedrooms and a hallway bath on the way,ep020
624,to the master suite here's your master,ep020
627,bedroom this is nice this is nice but I,ep020
630,hate that light fixture that's gotta go,ep020
633,the brass is just dated and I do not,ep020
636,like that here is your master bathroom,ep020
639,with the soaker tone what do you think,ep020
642,it's very nice I wonder if you can fit,ep020
645,in that today we'll find out oh yeah oh,ep020
648,sure twenty Roman style kid again oh,ep020
651,what'd you guys think of this house I,ep020
654,like it I think it's nice yeah it's a,ep020
657,good house one thing I really didn't,ep020
660,like was the kitchen the cabinets and,ep020
663,the countertops just wasn't quite that,ep020
666,updated kitchen that I was looking for I,ep020
669,did really think that there's a formal,ep020
672,dining there like that's hard to find I,ep020
675,think why I want it to be more openness,ep020
678,because I think we'd utilize the space,ep020
681,better if it was part of the other rooms,ep020
684,you know right the soaker tub is great,ep020
687,but I would really like to see a ranch,ep020
690,so Erin finds a ranch for Paige but,ep020
693,Stacy here's a problem we are at,ep020
696,"$250,000 oh it's kind of the top of our",ep020
699,budget,ep020
702,yeah,ep020
705,without much wiggle room there I suppose,ep020
708,[Music],ep020
711,put some flowers in there well,ep020
714,centerpiece there you go,ep020
717,the cute working with a 250 thousand,ep020
720,dollar budget Stacy and Paige are,ep020
723,looking for a home in Sioux Falls South,ep020
726,Dakota with room for their future family,ep020
729,to grow into we take that to school has,ep020
732,your school backpack oh no,ep020
735,so far they've seen a two-story,ep020
738,traditional that had a finished basement,ep020
741,for Stacey but Paige found the kitchen,ep020
744,lacking and it wasn't her preferred,ep020
747,ranch style,ep020
750,Hey look it's our ranch walking up right,ep020
753,away I was disappointed I wanted it to,ep020
756,be a two-story so I wasn't too excited,ep020
759,right off the bat morning team hey we,ep020
762,got a ranch home we got five bedroom,ep020
765,three bath three stall garage Suites,ep020

771,"size we are at $250,000 we're at the top",ep020
774,of your boy wait there's not much wiggle,ep020

780,but I think we're gonna like it sounds,ep020
783,good tiny yeah yeah like I don't even,ep020
786,know if our furniture would fit in here,ep020
789,honestly this is the dining space this,ep020
792,is perfect love that you can see into,ep020
795,the other rooms it's really good for,ep020
798,entertaining or for kids you can see,ep020
801,them from the kitchen I'm really,ep020
804,disappointed by the dining room it's,ep020
807,open it doesn't have its own walls and,ep020
810,honestly I don't even think I could put,ep020
813,my table in there kitchen is tiny it was,ep020
816,really small I was really hoping for a,ep020
819,white kitchen though I really want my,ep020
822,white cupboards well you want to check,ep020
825,out the family room here oh this is,ep020
828,interesting I call the woodwork on the,ep020
831,wall here yeah that's fireplace is,ep020
834,pretty sweet but the only thing is it's,ep020
837,gonna make your house smell like,ep020
840,delicious wood no it's mom,ep020
843,we can just replace that with a gas,ep020
846,insert it's a lot of work and a lot of,ep020
849,money that we,ep020
852,alright let's take a step outside oh wow,ep020
855,sting oh man this is awesome and I love,ep020
858,the big huge trees and no punching pine,ep020
861,trees nailed it yeah our future family,ep020
864,could have a lot of fun in this backyard,ep020
867,I can see us making a nice patio back,ep020
870,there grilling a nice barbecue area well,ep020
873,we like this,ep020
876,you need to see the garage alright big,ep020
879,plus I like it now there's none not a,ep020
882,good place to put my workbench or,ep020
885,anything now well this isn't it there's,ep020
888,more what yeah follow me awesome lucky,ep020
891,you all the third star third stall,ep020
894,across the house are a guest bath and,ep020
897,two bedrooms it's kind of an awkward,ep020
900,size yeah let's look at this master a,ep020
903,lot bigger than the other two that's for,ep020
906,sure great size yeah here's your master,ep020
909,bathroom Oh yikes this is small and I,ep020
912,don't have my tub and the bathroom is,ep020
915,just tiny there's one sink a shower,ep020
918,there's no tub and I really wanted a tub,ep020
921,they head downstairs to a finished,ep020
924,basement that's a good-size room,ep020
927,yeah this is a nice-sized room there's,ep020
930,an additional bathroom and two bedrooms,ep020
933,in the basement as well ooh low bridge,ep020
936,not sure how this would work for me well,ep020
939,but thanks for a great in-law suite,ep020
942,downstairs here be perfect what do you,ep020
945,think well I love that it's a ranch but,ep020
948,in the master bathroom that's kind of an,ep020
951,issue it's so small and I don't have my,ep020
954,tub and I don't have my formal dining,ep020
957,rooms that's kind of a bummer I love the,ep020
960,garage,ep020
963,yeah backyard is awesome all right Dean,ep020
966,think we should keep this on the list I,ep020
969,think so absolutely,ep020
972,since Stacy wants to see an older,ep020
975,character home their agent has lined up,ep020
978,this vintage charmer it's a,ep020
981,three-bedroom three-bath three-bedroom,ep020
984,though I'm not sure how I feel about,ep020
987,that I really was looking for four,ep020
990,[Music],ep020
993,which one's your favorite space I think,ep020
996,I kind of like them all in Sioux Falls,ep020
999,South Dakota Stacey and Paige are,ep020
1002,looking for a home with more space for,ep020
1005,their future family to grow into working,ep020
1008,with a two hundred and fifty thousand,ep020
1011,dollar budget they've seen a two-story,ep020
1014,traditional with the formal dining room,ep020
1017,Paige wants but it felt too closed off,ep020
1020,for Stacey then they saw a ranch Paige's,ep020
1023,preferred style but Stacey felt it was,ep020
1026,missing the Victorian features he wants,ep020
1029,so now they're headed to another option,ep020
1032,that their agent hopes will win Stacey,ep020
1035,over with some historical features I,ep020
1038,like it it's a little bit older a little,ep020
1041,more Victorian I like the windows in the,ep020
1044,front porch yeah it's not that ranch I,ep020
1047,was looking for but it does have the,ep020
1050,porch hey we got a nice 2-story here,ep020
1053,it's priced at 189 nine it's a 3-bedroom,ep020
1056,3-bath three-bedroom though I'm not sure,ep020
1059,how I feel about that I really was,ep020
1062,"looking for four and it's um 1,600",ep020
1065,square feet awesome thanks under budget,ep020
1068,check it out I love this front porch,ep020
1071,yeah it's really hewing interesting out,ep020
1074,here in the summer this is me this is,ep020
1077,nice I really like the hardwood floors,ep020
1080,right when you walk in it's a little,ep020
1083,tight actually kind of an awkward layout,ep020
1086,a free living room but I've never seen,ep020
1089,these little built-in details which are,ep020
1092,actually really cute it's nice I like,ep020
1095,kind of opens it up to the next area -,ep020
1098,yeah but yet it still kind of separates,ep020
1101,it which was something I was kind of,ep020
1104,looking for so,ep020
1107,I like that those are cool wow this is,ep020
1110,really nice and I love the fact that,ep020
1113,it's not a formal dining room we still,ep020
1116,have our dining space but it's a part of,ep020
1119,everything else so if people are sitting,ep020
1122,at the table you could still be in the,ep020
1125,kitchen I really want my formal dining,ep020
1128,room I can have a whole vision for that,ep020
1131,space and you know this is a nice space,ep020
1134,but it's just not really what I'm,ep020
1137,looking for,ep020
1140,well guys you should check out the,ep020
1143,beautiful kitchen here that's been,ep020
1146,recently remodeled yeah this is,ep020
1149,beautiful it's got the stone countertops,ep020
1152,the tile backsplash and new stainless,ep020
1155,steel appliances it's great if I could,ep020
1158,just take this white kitchen and put it,ep020
1161,in a four bedroom home that would be,ep020
1164,perfect for me oh wow this is really,ep020
1167,nice yeah it's huge it's not super,ep020
1170,private what's going on with this garage,ep020
1173,though yeah so this is a single stop but,ep020
1176,it's double deep so it's it is a,ep020
1179,technically a double stall garage I,ep020
1182,think you found a loophole and my wish,ep020
1185,list for a three stall garage back,ep020
1188,inside they head downstairs to the,ep020
1191,basement oh my gosh this is quite the,ep020
1194,finished basement you were looking for I,ep020
1197,guess there's a lot of extra money in,ep020
1200,the budget we could do some work down,ep020
1203,here but I'm just not even sure I'd want,ep020
1206,to with having to walk down these stairs,ep020
1209,the whole time yeah I absolutely hate,ep020
1212,the basement just way too much work and,ep020
1215,it's work that I don't want to do,ep020
1218,upstairs on the second floor our two,ep020
1221,guest bedrooms and a hall bathroom look,ep020
1224,right into your neighbor's house,ep020
1227,well here's the master this is actually,ep020
1230,a lot bigger than I thought home really,ep020
1233,nice big windows - I like that it's,ep020
1236,awesome natural light,ep020
1239,oh nice any others bathroom yeah this is,ep020
1242,nice,ep020
1245,I hate that there's no room for time in,ep020
1248,the master I want to see Paige happy and,ep020
1251,if it means having a bathtub so be it,ep020
1254,it's not something that is a must for me,ep020
1257,so I could definitely do without it not,ep020
1260,a Victorian but yeah pretty close yeah,ep020
1263,it's got some of the older features that,ep020
1266,I like though with the windows and the,ep020
1269,hardwood yeah it's definitely more your,ep020
1272,style than mine,ep020
1275,one thing I love in this house is that,ep020
1278,kitchen that is perfect 100% my style,ep020
1281,and exactly what I was looking for it I,ep020
1284,mean the basement absolutely sucks I,ep020
1287,can't even walk down there without,ep020
1290,hitting my head I know we're under,ep020
1293,budget but that's just too much work,ep020
1296,plus I didn't get my formal dining room,ep020
1299,or my soaker tub in this house now,ep020
1302,Stacey and Paige will have to decide,ep020
1305,what's most important a formal dining,ep020
1308,room a three-car garage or a renovated,ep020
1311,kitchen,ep020
1314,okay space I think we need to make a,ep020
1317,decision pretty soon,ep020
1320,[Music],ep020
1323,okay Stace I think we need to make a,ep020
1326,decision pretty soon working with a 250,ep020
1329,thousand dollar budget page and Stacey,ep020
1332,are eager to choose a home for their,ep020
1335,future family okay let's talk about that,ep020
1338,two-story house that was 230 for nine,ep020
1341,one thing I love about that house is it,ep020
1344,has a formal dining room plus it had,ep020
1347,that in-law suite that we're looking for,ep020
1350,in the basement I think that'd be an,ep020
1353,awesome place for our in-laws but I,ep020
1356,would definitely have to be sacrificing,ep020
1359,a three-stall garage and the yard was an,ep020
1362,ideal for me I kind of wanted a big,ep020
1365,private backyard that's kind of more of,ep020
1368,a side yard yeah it had those pine trees,ep020
1371,in the yard which I was not a fan of it,ep020
1374,all well that house had the soaker tub,ep020
1377,and that was something I really wanted,ep020
1380,okay so what do you think about that,ep020
1383,ranch for 249 nine well I obviously love,ep020
1386,that one because it was a ranch and it,ep020
1389,had five bedrooms which is awesome I,ep020
1392,really liked the fact that was the only,ep020
1395,house with three stall garage and that,ep020
1398,yard was was amazing and the kitchen was,ep020
1401,small and there was no formal dining,ep020
1404,right I think there's room for,ep020
1407,improvement with the kitchen there is,ep020
1410,but it's at the top of our budget so,ep020
1413,right that would make things difficult,ep020
1416,let's talk about the historical bungalow,ep020
1419,for one eighty nine nine yeah I really,ep020
1422,like the price on that one it really,ep020
1425,wasn't the Victorian I was looking for,ep020
1428,but it definitely had some of the,ep020
1431,historical feel that I wanted I was,ep020
1434,really bummed about the formal dining,ep020
1437,space in that house I thought it'd be in,ep020
1440,an old home it would probably have one,ep020
1443,but I think maybe I could look past that,ep020
1446,for that kitchen set but it was white,ep020
1449,and has the next countertops it was big,ep020
1452,it didn't have the in-law suite though,ep020
1455,yeah that space didn't have anything any,ep020
1458,basement so no no second living space,ep020
1461,what'd you think about that garage,ep020
1464,though the garage I liked that it was a,ep020
1467,two stall but I didn't like that it was,ep020
1470,a tandem Tucson and there was no tub but,ep020
1473,with the extra room we have in the,ep020
1476,budget I think we could put a tub in,ep020
1479,that extra bathroom so which one will,ep020
1482,they choose,ep020
1485,I think I know which one I want you I,ep020
1488,think so what do you think I'm thinking,ep020
1491,the traditional two-story really yeah,ep020
1494,that's what I like too,ep020
1497,I really like that it's a two-story home,ep020
1500,the bedrooms are separate from our,ep020
1503,entertaining and living space you know,ep020
1506,and I really wanted a ranch but I love,ep020
1509,that it has a formal dining room and it,ep020
1512,did have a soaker tub,ep020
1515,let's call Erin and put an offer in,ep020
1518,let's go call him right now arrived in,ep020
1521,the center underneath I think it turned,ep020
1524,out great I don't - the house was listed,ep020
1527,for 234 nine and we paid a full price at,ep020
1530,234 nine we've been in the house about,ep020
1533,two weeks now and we love being here we,ep020
1536,love the neighborhood it's really quiet,ep020
1539,street and everybody's been really,ep020
1542,welcoming since we've been here oh it's,ep020
1545,windy it's a little windy out today,ep020
1548,there's actually quite a few pieces in,ep020
1551,this house that we've put our own little,ep020
1554,touch on from either finding it at,ep020
1557,antique stores or flea markets I think,ep020
1560,this is the perfect spot for the lamp we,ep020
1563,found at the thrift store that was a,ep020
1566,good find,ep020
1569,it's really feeling like home now that,ep020
1572,everything's kind of decorate,ep020
12,oh wow look at this room this has the,ep021
15,high ceilings big bright rooms and a lot,ep021
18,of space for entertaining are high on,ep021
21,the list for these 26 year olds we're,ep021
24,looking forward to buying a home before,ep021
27,their upcoming wedding I'm just so ready,ep021
30,to finally move out of my pants but,ep021
33,flying the coop may have to wait since,ep021
36,these Long Islanders have very different,ep021
39,tastes and houses look at these walls,ep021
42,this is the rustic feature I was looking,ep021
45,for it looks old-fashioned it looks like,ep021
48,it needs to be redone if the wood walls,ep021
51,weren't here I would pay to put them in,ep021
54,this seems kind of small for a master,ep021
57,you can make it work with the a bed and,ep021
60,a dresser and that's all you need my,ep021
63,main concern is if I'm doing something,ep021
66,in the kitchen or we have friends over I,ep021
69,would be all by myself and someone,ep021
72,always get stuck in the kitchen,ep021
75,[Music],ep021
78,[Music],ep021
81,my name is Emily I'm 26 years old and,ep021
84,I'm a teacher for children with autism,ep021
87,my name is Dan I'm 26 years old I work,ep021
90,as a product engineer,ep021
93,thank you so much that was so quick we,ep021
96,met through mutual friends in college,ep021
99,three and a half years ago how was it I,ep021
102,love Dan because he can be serious but,ep021
105,also total goofball,ep021
108,he loves his nieces and nephews so much,ep021
111,he's definitely obsessed with his horror,ep021
114,movies Emily is very outgoing she's very,ep021
117,friendly so he songs so much to figure,ep021
120,out for the wedding and now that they're,ep021
123,getting married they want to buy their,ep021
126,own house here in New York on Long,ep021
129,Island where both of them grew up Long,ep021
132,Island is a great place to live because,ep021
135,it's close to anything you would need or,ep021
138,want to do the beaches and the shops and,ep021
141,the malls you can travel to Manhattan,ep021
144,really easily from Long Island it's just,ep021
147,a quick train ride oh look at this one,ep021
150,we are currently living at Dan's parents,ep021
153,house it's been really awesome that his,ep021
156,parents have let us live with them but,ep021
159,we're definitely ready to move out we,ep021
162,didn't have to pay you rent that,ep021
165,definitely gave us a boost in helping us,ep021
168,buy our first home but still it'll be a,ep021
171,bit of a stretch since homes on Long,ep021
174,Island are pricey,ep021
177,yeah our budget is I believe 550 and I,ep021
180,don't think we're going a penny over we,ep021
183,definitely want to stay under that and,ep021
186,we I personally prefer to have the,ep021
189,"budget closer to 500,000 if we do go",ep021
192,close to 550 it has to be completely,ep021
195,move-in ready with not much to do at all,ep021
198,this house looks gorgeous,ep021
201,nice-looking colonial I grew up in a,ep021
204,colonial I love the bedrooms are,ep021
207,upstairs it really separates the noise,ep021
210,when people are trying to rest I don't,ep021
213,know about all those stairs look at this,ep021
216,sign it's a ranch I'm interested in,ep021
219,looking for a ranch-style home I think,ep021
222,it's awesome when everything is on the,ep021
225,same floor and if you do want that,ep021
228,private space you could always go to the,ep021
231,basement Dan's on board with a basement,ep021
234,since he'd love his own personal game,ep021
237,room I would love to have a basement,ep021
240,with a man spa,ep021
243,where I can have my own pool table or,ep021
246,ping-pong table or all right that's a,ep021
249,place for me,ep021
252,Dan's also willing to consider homes,ep021
255,that may need some work well we don't,ep021
258,have any kids right now and I think this,ep021
261,would be a good time for us where we,ep021
264,could totally take our time put our,ep021
267,money into it and make it you don't know,ep021
270,how much money you're going to end up,ep021
273,putting into it you open up walls and,ep021
276,you find all problems you didn't know,ep021
279,we're there and we're going to use up,ep021
282,all of our savings I would love if my,ep021
285,house could have three beds and two full,ep021
288,baths but I definitely prefer a fourth,ep021
291,bedroom to get that fourth bedroom they,ep021
294,realize they may have to compromise on,ep021
297,location we probably prefer to find a,ep021
300,house in Nassau County because that's,ep021
303,closer to our jobs and our families but,ep021
306,we were open to more out east and,ep021
309,Suffolk County because you can get a,ep021
312,little bit more out there ooh,ep021
315,space looks nice and open and bright I,ep021
318,love that I definitely need an,ep021
321,open-concept floor plan with the kitchen,ep021
324,to the living space I would love some,ep021
327,special rustic elements like exposed,ep021
330,brick or exposed wood beams,ep021
333,I prefer tall white on the inside it,ep021
336,makes the house look more modern it's,ep021
339,just so white there's no color anywhere,ep021
342,I would definitely like a lot of warmer,ep021
345,color tones instead of a lot of white,ep021
348,I'm just so ready to finally move out of,ep021
351,my parents house doing great living here,ep021
354,but I think it's time to establish our,ep021
357,own wife yeah a first up a house in,ep021
360,their ideal location in Nassau County,ep021
363,just 10 minutes from their parents oh,ep021
366,this is definitely not a ranch but I,ep021
369,love all that brick it's a nice colonial,ep021
372,yeah I love the shutters and the look of,ep021
375,the porch I just wish this exact look,ep021
378,was on a one-story home I don't know I,ep021
381,like the colonial look the two-story I,ep021
384,love this big driveway and the streets,ep021
387,are really nice and quiet hey guys how,ep021
390,are you come on in Thanks let me tell,ep021
393,you about the house it's a colonial it's,ep021
396,a three-bedroom one full bath one half,ep021
399,bath been totally renovated,ep021
402,approximately a thousand square feet,ep021
405,it's a little small is there a basement,ep021
408,there is a full basement okay and it's,ep021
411,priced at 469 oh definitely in our,ep021
414,budget that's good for something that's,ep021
417,redone that's great all right take a,ep021
420,look I really like these wood floors I,ep021
423,like how they're a darker color,ep021
426,and really makes the space feel warm,ep021
429,over here you would put your table if,ep021
432,you're eating kitchen you should also,ep021
435,have it as your dining room which leads,ep021
438,into the kitchen she wanted that open,ep021
441,plan look to it yeah I actually don't,ep021
444,think I mind the white cabinets here,ep021
447,because um it's paired with the nice,ep021
450,warm color countertops and the wood,ep021
453,floors so as we keep going,ep021
456,you have your family room or dining room,ep021
459,with the open floor plan allows you to,ep021
462,make choices yeah I would definitely,ep021
465,make this into like a living room,ep021
468,hanging in the kitchen you could also be,ep021
471,hanging out with people let me show you,ep021
474,the outside all right watch your step,ep021
477,like this day this is a great backyard,ep021
480,for a Nassau County and it's a good size,ep021
483,it's also nice and quiet back here I,ep021
486,don't hear a lot of road sounds I just,ep021
489,hear the birds,ep021
492,yeah the bears are hanging down it feels,ep021
495,peaceful back here back inside they see,ep021
498,the downstairs half bath and then over,ep021
501,here could be a dining room it could be,ep021
504,another living room you have three rooms,ep021
507,that you can really choose from right,ep021
510,how you want to set up your home I think,ep021
513,this would be a nice area for the dining,ep021
516,room the only thing is to bring food,ep021
519,from the kitchen it's not the open,ep021
522,feeling I was hoping for but it's still,ep021
525,really nice space upstairs they see two,ep021
528,secondary bedrooms this is a very tight,ep021
531,room you have opportunity in this house,ep021
534,because over the garage you have flat,ep021
537,space and you could extend this as well,ep021
540,as the last bedroom over the garage and,ep021
543,then you could also put another bathroom,ep021
546,here as well yeah that can definitely,ep021
549,help we can do the bump out make the,ep021
552,rooms a little bit bigger,ep021
555,while this home is listed at a good,ep021
558,price those things get very expensive I,ep021
561,really don't know if that would end up,ep021
564,staying in our budget nice room with a,ep021
567,lot of light coming into it as well yeah,ep021
570,there is a lot of natural light but this,ep021
573,seems kind of small for a master,ep021
576,you can make it work with the a bed and,ep021
579,a dresser do you that's all you need so,ep021
582,you have a full-size bed here oh that's,ep021
585,great I don't know it's like a master,ep021
588,bath this is the only full bath for the,ep021
591,three bedrooms on the right I think it'd,ep021
594,be okay let's check out the basement,ep021
597,guys oh this is a really nicely finished,ep021
600,basement yeah this would be a great spot,ep021
603,for my man space doesn't even feel like,ep021
606,a basement down here it feels like a,ep021
609,done,ep021
612,[Music],ep021
615,what do you think of the home well it's,ep021
618,definitely not a ranch this house though,ep021
621,had that curb appeal with the brick and,ep021
624,the shutters and the porch you can't,ep021
627,beat the fact that it's located in,ep021
630,Nassau County right near our friends our,ep021
633,jobs our families yeah the house feels,ep021
636,very modern redone but it just feels,ep021
639,really boring inside the only rustic,ep021
642,element of this house is the brick on,ep021
645,the outside but I do love the fact that,ep021
648,it's colonial and like Peter said we,ep021
651,could extend the house over the garage,ep021
654,and he even suggested adding another,ep021
657,full bath but that could just go so,ep021
660,over-budget since Emily would prefer a,ep021
663,ranch their agents lined up one to show,ep021
666,them although Dan might be a tough sell,ep021
669,yeah but the house looks small from the,ep021
672,outside,ep021
675,[Music],ep021
678,can I have an everything bagel with,ep021
681,scallion cream cheese please engaged,ep021
684,couple Dan and Emily have been living,ep021
687,with his parents to save money for a,ep021
690,home on Long Island we definitely need,ep021
693,to leave some room in our budget because,ep021
696,we have no furniture since we lived with,ep021
699,your parents,ep021
702,everything is theirs we don't have,ep021
705,anything with a max budget of five,ep021
708,hundred and fifty thousand dollars,ep021
711,they've seen a 3-bedroom colonial in,ep021
714,their prime location since it was under,ep021
717,budget,ep021
720,Dan's open to adding some square footage,ep021
723,over the garage but Emily's nervous,ep021
726,about taking on an expensive project and,ep021
729,style-wise she'd really prefer a rustic,ep021
732,ranch so now they're back in the same,ep021
735,prime area to see a property that may,ep021
738,appeal more to her this doesn't look,ep021
741,like in colonial yeah this one's our,ep021
744,ranch for me but look at the nice quiet,ep021
747,street yeah but the house looks small,ep021
750,from the outside obviously Peter was,ep021
753,thinking about Emily when he picked this,ep021
756,house this is nothing like a colonial,ep021
759,Dan's not even giving this ranch a,ep021
762,chance he's just all colonial colonial,ep021
765,colonial hey guys come on oh it looks a,ep021
768,lot bigger on the inside than from the,ep021
771,other side yeah so this is a beautiful,ep021
774,expanded ranch approximately 1430 square,ep021
777,feet,ep021
780,it has three bedrooms two baths priced,ep021
783,around 535 535 is towards the top of our,ep021
786,budget so it needs to be pretty close to,ep021
789,perfect right I understand,ep021
792,Long Island is a very desirable market,ep021
795,so the home prices reflect that I really,ep021
798,like these wood floors right when you,ep021
801,walk in it just makes the house feel,ep021
804,really warm and gives it a little bit of,ep021
807,a rustic vibe you have really really,ep021
810,pretty wood floors this is more of the,ep021
813,living room family room,ep021
816,I love the recessed lighting and I also,ep021
819,love the natural light as well yeah,ep021
822,these windows are beautiful oh wow look,ep021
825,at this room this has the high ceiling,ep021
828,yeah this is uh this is the great room,ep021
831,so I love this room this could be your,ep021
834,dining room it could be another den yeah,ep021
837,I love to like come look at all the,ep021
840,light there's so many windows then look,ep021
843,at these walls this is the rustic,ep021
846,feature I was looking for they're,ep021
849,gorgeous,ep021
852,I I don't really like them this looks,ep021
855,like there's holes that need to be,ep021
858,filled the holes give the house some,ep021
861,character it's so special I really,ep021
864,really love this I don't know why emily,ep021
867,is obsessed with these rustic walls I,ep021
870,think it looks old-fashioned it looks,ep021
873,like it needs to be redone dan is crazy,ep021
876,the rustic look of this house is so,ep021
879,great if the wood walls weren't here I,ep021
882,would pay to put them in let's take a,ep021
885,look at the backyard oh it looks like a,ep021
888,good-size yard under all the snow you,ep021
891,have a beautiful deck oh that's awesome,ep021
894,yeah especially during the summer when,ep021
897,we have barbecues or something I don't,ep021
900,know about the hot tub I think it's a,ep021
903,great future I know we didn't want a,ep021
906,pool because of the cost of maintenance,ep021
909,I think a pool is a different story a,ep021
912,pool is definitely a deal breaker for me,ep021
915,but I think the hot tub is a great,ep021
918,addition that I never thought of I think,ep021
921,it's easy maintenance and it would be,ep021
924,great for us oh wow this kitchen is,ep021
927,really nice yeah it's a nice boat,ep021
930,outside I love the stainless steel,ep021
933,appliances and this granite countertop,ep021
936,is huge I'm not sure like the old-school,ep021
939,look of cabinets know anyone like oh,ep021
942,they just have like that vintage rustic,ep021
945,feel they're supposed to be a little off,ep021
948,ways I don't know how I feel about that,ep021
951,the most important thing for us is that,ep021
954,this kitchen is so open-concept I could,ep021
957,still see into this space here,ep021
960,and even though I'm small it definitely,ep021
963,feels bigger so here you have the first,ep021
966,guest room that feels extremely small I,ep021
969,grew up in a small bedroom and you could,ep021
972,definitely fit a twin size bed over,ep021
975,there and there's enough room for a,ep021
978,dresser Oh easily yes so that's all you,ep021
981,need a good size closet as well they see,ep021
984,another secondary bedroom then head to,ep021
987,the guest bath oh this is nice,ep021
990,I really like that there's a nice tub,ep021
993,here because that's great down the line,ep021
996,for kids let's check out the master,ep021
999,bedroom,ep021
1002,sure also a really good-size room we,ep021
1005,could definitely fit a king bed in here,ep021
1008,what also is nice about is that the,ep021
1011,master has an ensuite oh this is great,ep021
1014,having two full bathrooms in the house,ep021
1017,yeah this is beautiful this must have,ep021
1020,been recently redone also I love the,ep021
1023,stone it feels a little tight but at,ep021
1026,least we'd have a mess,ep021
1029,banter they head downstairs to the,ep021
1032,finished basement oh wow this is a great,ep021
1035,space you have a bar which is a nice wet,ep021
1038,bar and then if you look around you have,ep021
1041,plenty of space to put like a foosball,ep021
1044,table air hockey ping-pong table put a,ep021
1047,nice TV set here there's plenty options,ep021
1050,just still needs a lot of work though,ep021
1053,this would definitely add to our budget,ep021
1056,so what do you think about the home I,ep021
1059,love it it has that open concept it has,ep021
1062,so much natural light I love that it's a,ep021
1065,ranch and it really has that special,ep021
1068,rustic look that I was looking for I do,ep021
1071,like the vaulted ceilings I think the,ep021
1074,master suite is definitely a plus I,ep021
1077,don't like the fact that it's not a,ep021
1080,colonial I really don't like the,ep021
1083,cabinetry I think it's a little too,ep021
1086,rustic for me and it has three bedrooms,ep021
1089,even though I prefer four all right,ep021
1092,let's go see some more homes since a,ep021
1095,4-bedroom home would be their ideal,ep021
1098,their agents finally come through with,ep021
1101,one wow this is a big colonial yeah it,ep021
1104,actually it looks really beautiful,ep021
1107,we need to start thinking about our,ep021
1110,save-the-dates,ep021
1113,okay dan and Emily are planning a,ep021
1116,wedding and buying their first home this,ep021
1119,one is wearing a clothes tough line I,ep021
1122,like this one with a max budget of five,ep021
1125,hundred and fifty thousand dollars,ep021
1128,they've seen a colonial for Dan and a,ep021
1131,rustic ranch for Emily both were in,ep021
1134,their prime Nassau County location but,ep021
1137,neither had four bedrooms now they're,ep021
1140,farther out in Suffolk County to see,ep021
1143,another option wow this is a big,ep021
1146,colonial yeah it actually it looks,ep021
1149,really beautiful but I bet there's a lot,ep021
1152,of stairs in there yeah but it's so,ep021
1155,spacious listen to the busy road it's on,ep021
1158,hey thanks House was built in 1950 as,ep021
1161,four bedroom two full and one half bath,ep021
1164,"about 2,400 square feet we can never get",ep021
1167,this size house and NASA on our budget,ep021
1170,"and it's priced at 429,000 Stefan Utley",ep021
1173,within our budget um I just don't know,ep021
1176,if we'd want to do this commute every,ep021
1179,day yeah you're about 40 45 minutes past,ep021
1182,where your family is,ep021
1185,I know we're a far out here in Long,ep021
1188,Island there's just so many,ep021
1191,opportunities out here with the fourth,ep021
1194,bedroom I think it's worth the commute,ep021
1197,to come out here this far everything,ep021
1200,looks clean at noon yeah I like the big,ep021
1203,windows and I do love these wood floors,ep021
1206,the combination living room and dining,ep021
1209,room wrap around here yeah I love the,ep021
1212,flow of the house so far but I see this,ep021
1215,big wall right here to enter the kitchen,ep021
1218,it just it doesn't have that,ep021
1221,open-concept feel I was looking for it,ep021
1224,does it it doesn't but the kitchens all,ep021
1227,been updated you're gonna see that it,ep021
1230,has a really cool feel to it Wow tastes,ep021
1233,like a nice modern white bright kitchen,ep021
1236,you have the shaker cabinetry your,ep021
1239,granite countertop undermount sink and,ep021
1242,glass backsplash yeah I love it you can,ep021
1245,have a table here look outside nice big,ep021
1248,window there's a lot of white with the,ep021
1251,harsh black it's a little too modern and,ep021
1254,not really,ep021
1257,Cosi but my main concern is the open,ep021
1260,concept if I'm doing something in the,ep021
1263,kitchen or we have friends over I would,ep021
1266,be all by myself,ep021
1269,someone always get stuck in the kitchen,ep021
1272,it's something to think about they see a,ep021
1275,half bath on the way to the family room,ep021
1278,it's beautiful it is I really like these,ep021
1281,wide plank,ep021
1284,dark wood floors and I love that brick,ep021
1287,wall that gives this house a tiny bit of,ep021
1290,a special rustic feature what you step,ep021
1293,look at this backyard a lot of space you,ep021
1296,can have a barbecue you can have a lot,ep021
1299,of people very gonna do it thank ya we,ep021
1302,could never get this size property back,ep021
1305,in Nassau it looks like it needs a lot,ep021
1308,of landscaping I don't know how much,ep021
1311,that would cost you could get someone to,ep021
1314,give you an S to it and you can make it,ep021
1317,your own you can plant bushes that,ep021
1320,there's a lot of things you could do,ep021
1323,back inside they head upstairs let's,ep021
1326,check out the master bedroom,ep021
1329,with an ensuite lots of space and loo,ep021
1332,this beautiful bathroom it's all been,ep021
1335,updated nicely done,ep021
1338,oh that's really nice to have a master,ep021
1341,bath and the room is a good size but to,ep021
1344,come up and down those stairs every day,ep021
1347,it just might be nice to have everything,ep021
1350,open on one floor Emily doesn't,ep021
1353,understand the benefits of the colonial,ep021
1356,I think it's great having the two floors,ep021
1359,separate it's not all cluttered and,ep021
1362,claustrophobic on the first floor where,ep021
1365,everything's in one section so here you,ep021
1368,have a really gorgeous full bath with a,ep021
1371,tub tile up to the ceiling yeah I think,ep021
1374,it was done really nicely it's just very,ep021
1377,simple the colors are neutral and this,ep021
1380,double vanity looks very nice what's,ep021
1383,really cool about this is called a,ep021
1386,jack-and-jill bathroom so it comes in,ep021
1389,here and then it leads into the next,ep021
1392,bedroom okay you have the gorgeous,ep021
1395,hardwood floors in here and lots and,ep021
1398,lots of space I mean you could easily,ep021
1401,fit you know queen and king sized bed in,ep021
1404,these rooms yeah this is a nice good,ep021
1407,size space they see two more secondary,ep021
1410,bedrooms that's a huge bonus that this,ep021
1413,house has a fourth bedroom two flights,ep021
1416,down is the basement you have some,ep021
1419,really good space down here we can make,ep021
1422,it a nice man space or a gym definitely,ep021
1425,some work to do but I think we can do,ep021
1428,that over time and put our own imprint,ep021
1431,on it,ep021
1434,so when you think of the home guys I,ep021
1437,love the fact that its colonial I think,ep021
1440,it's big bedrooms upstairs and it does,ep021
1443,have that fourth bedroom and the,ep021
1446,backyard is beautiful and also the whole,ep021
1449,basement downstairs but they both need a,ep021
1452,lot of work it doesn't have that,ep021
1455,open-concept look that I was really,ep021
1458,looking for whoever's in the kitchen is,ep021
1461,kind of on their own it's a lot to,ep021
1464,consider,ep021
1467,so Emily and Dan will have to choose,ep021
1470,what's most important a finished,ep021
1473,basement a master suite or nabbing that,ep021
1476,fourth bedroom so we need to make a,ep021
1479,decision we're here for our wedding cake,ep021
1482,tasting engaged couple Emily and Dan,ep021
1485,have a budget of five hundred and fifty,ep021
1488,thousand dollars to buy their first home,ep021
1491,on Long Island after seeing several,ep021
1494,options it's time to choose,ep021
1497,so what do you think about the brick,ep021
1500,colonial at 469 I love the fact that it,ep021
1503,was a colonial with two stories yeah I,ep021
1506,love the look of the outside but it,ep021
1509,didn't really have much of a rustic feel,ep021
1512,on the inside and the bathroom upstairs,ep021
1515,was this one bathroom before three rooms,ep021
1518,I liked Peters idea of being able to,ep021
1521,bump it out over the garage but a home,ep021
1524,is already pretty expensive so projects,ep021
1527,like that can really add up but it's,ep021
1530,very convenient for our work and our,ep021
1533,friends and family and on the other home,ep021
1536,that was really close to everything is,ep021
1539,the ranch priced at 5:35 you walk in and,ep021
1542,it feels open right away there's the,ep021
1545,nice entryway I love the color of the,ep021
1548,wood floors the curb appeal was,ep021
1551,definitely not there for me and also the,ep021
1554,bedrooms were not as big as I expected,ep021
1557,but at least the master had that ensuite,ep021
1560,which is something we never thought we,ep021
1563,would have,ep021
1566,I like the big basement yeah I think,ep021
1569,that basement has a lot of potential I,ep021
1572,also love that the home had that rustic,ep021
1575,feel inside with those wood walls I,ep021
1578,really do wish it had that fourth,ep021
1581,bedroom and that gray colonial it was,ep021
1584,priced just 429 when I first walked up,ep021
1587,to it I heard it's how how many stairs,ep021
1590,were in that house yeah but I love the,ep021
1593,look of the house from the outside I did,ep021
1596,not like the colors in that kitchen but,ep021
1599,and forth broom with a master bathroom,ep021
1602,and all the bedrooms were big not just,ep021
1605,the master but it's so far away so we,ep021
1608,need to make a decision I think I know,ep021
1611,which one I want to eliminate first,ep021
1614,though gray colonial while it was a,ep021
1617,gorgeous giant home I just wouldn't be,ep021
1620,able to live with that busy street and I,ep021
1623,just think the distance is too much yeah,ep021
1626,that's true,ep021
1629,I love the curb appeal of brick colonial,ep021
1632,but the range just has the extra,ep021
1635,bathroom which we're gonna need down the,ep021
1638,road so I think that maybe even one that,ep021
1641,we'll have to go with it's a great home,ep021
1644,for us somewhere we can really grow into,ep021
1647,let's get Peter a call all right it has,ep021
1650,been two months since we bought the,ep021
1653,house and we moved in about a month ago,ep021
1656,it's convenient for it work for both of,ep021
1659,us and it's close to our family and,ep021
1662,"friends the house was listed at 535,000",ep021
1665,and we paid 525 for it my favorite space,ep021
1668,in the house is the living room I think,ep021
1671,it's a great entertainment area,ep021
1674,definitely my favorite we haven't had to,ep021
1677,do a lot of house projects because the,ep021
1680,home was basically move-in-ready but we,ep021
1683,were basically starting from scratch in,ep021
1686,terms of furniture tables is amazing I,ep021
1689,want to use the basement as a man space,ep021
1692,set up a nice couch there with a nice TV,ep021
1695,we made the kitchen open to a small,ep021
1698,couch and a table and we use it for,ep021
1701,having friends gather around the,ep021
1704,peninsula one of my main compromises was,ep021
1707,that it didn't have the fourth bedroom,ep021
1710,but for now it's working out just fine,ep021
1713,since it's just the two of us and we'll,ep021
1716,figure that out down the road well this,ep021
1719,house definitely is not a colonial which,ep021
1722,is what I was looking for turns out I,ep021
1725,really have no regrets the ranch is,ep021
1728,really growing on me it's definitely,ep021
1731,exciting being homeowners for the first,ep021
1734,time having our own space it's a great,ep021
1737,feeling just everything I ever hopes my,ep021
1740,home would be and I'm just so happy we,ep021
1743,found it,ep021
1746,[Music],ep021
12,there's glitter in there Megan and Jamie,ep022
15,are on the hunt in Clarksville Tennessee,ep022
18,while she's particularly finishes I,ep022
21,don't like this granite,ep022
24,it looks like rocky road ice cream,ep022
27,husband JB who's in the military wants,ep022
30,storage space for his vehicles and gear,ep022
33,my three-car garage he's also after a,ep022
36,massive bonus room and since she's a,ep022

108,part-time at a radio station where she,ep022

114,tater tots and he offered me his tater,ep022
117,tots and I gave him my heart the rest is,ep022
120,history this where Lewis and Clark,ep022

129,Leavenworth Kansas and we're moving to,ep022
132,Fort Campbell near Clarksville Tennessee,ep022
135,because the army says that it's time to,ep022
138,move and I'm being restained Clarksville,ep022
141,has a good reputation and the military,ep022
144,community of being a nice town hunting,ep022
147,fishing hiking camping and it's also,ep022
150,about two and a half to three hours from,ep022
153,both our families homes so we are so,ep022
156,excited to finally get close to home,ep022
159,your minds gonna be blown little buddy,ep022
162,yet at the same time that we're getting,ep022
165,ready to move is kind of the military,ep022
168,move season so there will be a frantic,ep022
171,search for houses from other people than,ep022
174,than just us thankfully we have a great,ep022
177,realtor who understands the military,ep022
180,lifestyle and what our needs are hey,ep022
183,Larry it's good good we are so excited,ep022
186,to finally get the search of the house,ep022
189,started in Clarksville so our budget is,ep022
192,"$300,000 and I would like a nice",ep022
195,traditional style home a two-story brick,ep022
198,colonial with a grand formal feeling,ep022
201,would be ideal I love that style I just,ep022
204,think it's so pretty and so classic,ep022
207,especially as we're moving to the south,ep022
210,and I'm looking more for like a,ep022
213,craftsman I like a Craftsman style home,ep022
216,cuz they're unique he likes their front,ep022
219,porches wood trim and homey fireplaces I,ep022
222,really don't like split levels because,ep022
225,it just seems so disjointed at least,ep022
228,three bedrooms is something that we're,ep022
231,definitely gonna have to have that way,ep022
234,we'll have a guest room and a place for,ep022
237,her to set up her home radio studio I,ep022
240,need,ep022
243,have a separate space that is quiet that,ep022
246,I can have all my equipment in just for,ep022
249,an area to entertain to hang out so that,ep022
252,can have friends over entertain watch,ep022
255,football without getting in her way and,ep022
258,disturbing her life,ep022
261,I would like updated kitchen something,ep022
264,with nice countertops nice cabinets and,ep022
267,updated appliances would be wonderful,ep022
270,hardwood floors and vaulted ceilings,ep022
273,make both their lists and three-car,ep022
276,garage,ep022
279,so I've room for my tools and things,ep022
282,like that I think another thing for the,ep022
285,wish list is a nice outdoor patio or,ep022
288,deck right yes because we that we do,ep022
291,like to to grill out on weekends and,ep022
294,hang out outside considering the dog,ep022
297,when we look for a house is really,ep022
300,important because he's a huge part of,ep022
303,our life so a fenced yard is a must so,ep022
306,that he can have room to go out and play,ep022
309,and I'm looking for something that's,ep022
312,that's close to posed all right sounds,ep022
315,good Larry thank you so much all right,ep022
318,you got the dog I got the bags all right,ep022
321,let's do this let's go Tennessee here we,ep022
324,come,ep022
327,[Music],ep022
330,now that they're in clarksville for a,ep022
333,short visit they're meeting their broker,ep022
336,at the first house he's lined up I like,ep022
339,this it's that traditional colonial,ep022
342,style I like yeah I just don't know if,ep022
345,it has a uniqueness I was looking for,ep022
348,like with the Craftsman style and I'm,ep022
351,seeing a two-car garage and you know,ep022
354,really after a three-car garage yeah but,ep022
357,you might have to just deal with it,ep022
360,hello Meghan Meghan nice to meet you to,ep022
363,finally meet you in person,ep022
366,same here well let me give you a little,ep022
369,bit of background about the home this is,ep022
372,actually four bedrooms okay okay,ep022
375,three and a half baths and it's actually,ep022
378,"3,100 square foot but how far are we",ep022
381,from posts here right around 35 minutes,ep022
384,it's a little bit of a drive so the 35,ep022
387,minute commute between this house and,ep022
390,post doesn't sound that bad but when I,ep022
393,get there early in the mornings I'm,ep022
396,competing with thousands of other,ep022
399,soldiers to get through the same,ep022
402,security checkpoints to get to work on,ep022
405,time and that could add as much as 15 or,ep022
408,20 minutes to my commute it's a little,ep022
411,bit over your budget,ep022
414,three hundred and seven thousand okay so,ep022
417,we're stretching it just know it's,ep022
420,"stretching that 300,000",ep022
423,oh I love ceilings the space is this,ep022
426,really nice entryway yeah this is really,ep022
429,nice,ep022
432,let's go in here okay actually your,ep022
435,formal living room it's pretty but I'm,ep022
438,worried that it could be wasted space,ep022
441,because what are you gonna do in a,ep022
444,formal living room if you don't want,ep022
447,people going all the way through your,ep022
450,health you stop them right here that,ep022
453,could come in handy let's go into the,ep022
456,actual formal dining room okay they did,ep022
459,a great job with the room with the chair,ep022
462,rail even though it's not a craftsman,ep022
465,you know it still kind of has that that,ep022
468,detailed look to it this would be great,ep022
471,for when family comes to visit in the,ep022
474,beginning I wasn't really worried about,ep022
477,getting a formal dining room but after,ep022
480,seeing the dining room in this house it,ep022
483,kind of nice I think that could be a,ep022
486,cool feature to have especially being so,ep022
489,close to family and friends this is,ep022
492,actually a dad I really like that,ep022
495,there's a fireplace yeah another thing,ep022
498,that I really like is the hardwood,ep022
501,floors here in the living room and how,ep022
504,they continue throughout the dining room,ep022
507,in the entryway what guys let's follow,ep022
510,me all right,ep022
513,here's the master bedroom oh those,ep022
516,ceilings the double tray and the molding,ep022
519,it's a little smaller I think that what,ep022
522,I have in mind for a master let's take a,ep022
525,look at the bathroom okay I love the,ep022
528,double vanities and the granite this is,ep022
531,gorgeous and then this is the closet,ep022
534,this is huge wow this is like a whole,ep022
537,nother room they cross back through the,ep022
540,den to see the kitchen so much counter,ep022
543,space so much cabinet space oh my gosh,ep022
546,is this like double ovens maybe I can,ep022
549,burn all kinds of things at once well,ep022
552,guys let's take a look at the backyard,ep022
555,oh yes,ep022
558,this is a gorgeous deck I love this -,ep022
561,wow this is perfect just notice one,ep022
564,thing now take a chance I would be,ep022
567,willing to buy funds for this yes all,ep022
570,right sounds great,ep022
573,back inside they pass a half bath and,ep022
576,laundry room on the way to the garage,ep022
579,you know I really wanted a three car and,ep022
582,and this is a two car and it even seems,ep022
585,small for a two car I'd really like more,ep022
588,space in the garage for my tools my,ep022
591,outdoor gear and to be able to give both,ep022
594,vehicles into the garage upstairs they,ep022
597,see a guest bath and three guest,ep022
600,bedrooms okay this could be like a radio,ep022
603,studio or guest bedroom this would be,ep022
606,perfect it's not great on the street,ep022
609,yeah this would be great,ep022
612,let's take a look at the bonus space,ep022
615,there's a bonus space yeah this is for,ep022
618,John here oh my gosh yes this is nice,ep022
621,it'd be great for watching football put,ep022
624,all my stuff in here the bonus room does,ep022
627,give some wow factor to the house and,ep022
630,compared with the price of the house I,ep022
633,think it's a really good value this,ep022
636,house is absolutely gorgeous I love that,ep022
639,there is so much space and so many,ep022
642,different options for my radio studio,ep022
645,the kitchen is amazing the backyard is,ep022
648,fantastic yeah but it is concerning that,ep022
651,there's not a fence I'd really like to,ep022
654,see a house is closer to post,ep022
657,so they head off to see another option I,ep022
660,really like the front porch,ep022
663,yeah but JB spots an issue this really,ep022
666,looks like a two-car garage,ep022
669,[Music],ep022
672,kind of crazy to think that after her 11,ep022
675,years in the army,ep022
678,all these different states are finally,ep022
681,going to be living in our home state,ep022
684,"working with a $300,000 budget Megan and",ep022
687,JB are hoping to find a home in,ep022
690,Clarksville Tennessee and with family,ep022
693,nearby they want an upgrade at home with,ep022
696,lots of space so they can entertain in,ep022
699,style all the other states and places we,ep022
702,lived I mean they were all great but,ep022
705,they're not home they're not home so far,ep022
708,they've seen a brick traditional Megan's,ep022
711,ideal style they both liked all of the,ep022
714,updates and all the space but the yard,ep022
717,had no fence the garage was only a,ep022
720,two-car it was slightly over budget and,ep022
723,the commute would be long for JB,ep022
726,so now they're seeing a less expensive,ep022
729,option this is beautiful I love it,ep022
732,two-story traditional it's not really,ep022
735,the craftsman I wanted this really looks,ep022
738,like a two-car garage but I really like,ep022
741,the front porch yeah the front door and,ep022
744,there's already a garden I mean it's,ep022
747,already got some landscaping done hey,ep022
750,how you doing good let me tell you,ep022
753,little bit about the house okay it's,ep022
756,actually a brand new home it's actually,ep022
759,a three bedroom three and a half bath,ep022
762,okay the cost of this house is actually,ep022
765,two hundred and sixty nine thousand oh,ep022
768,yeah very under budget okay and so how,ep022
771,far are we from posts from here you got,ep022
774,less than 15 20 minutes we can work with,ep022
777,that,ep022
780,all right just go in let's check it out,ep022
783,[Music],ep022
786,I like the fireplace I don't like that,ep022
789,it's gas because that's prefer a regular,ep022
792,wood fireplace I don't he's like every,ep022
795,time you made I like a fire ants on the,ep022
798,back so I'm okay,ep022
801,this is like eat-in kitchen okay this is,ep022
804,your dining area okay this is a really,ep022
807,nice kitchen oh it's got the granite,ep022
810,countertops yeah and I love the cabinets,ep022
813,I love the kitchen especially the,ep022
816,granite countertops and I love that not,ep022
819,only that they're dark and they'll hide,ep022
822,stains like wine stains but also there's,ep022
825,glitter in the granite a laundry room,ep022
828,and half bath lead to the garage so it's,ep022
831,like we suspected it's a two-car garage,ep022
834,pretty cute boy he's actually finished I,ep022
837,think it kind of makes up for the fact,ep022
840,that it's not a three car well I don't,ep022
843,know about that they head out back to,ep022
846,see the yard oh wow oh what a great deck,ep022
849,this is huge but I don't know about the,ep022
852,yard,ep022
855,I mean cash is a big dog and I don't,ep022
858,know if that's the amount of room that,ep022
861,we were expecting for a backyard back,ep022
864,inside they head upstairs to a bonus,ep022
867,room oh wow wet bar this is so easy this,ep022
870,is great for entertaining friends,ep022
873,I love the bonus space it is big enough,ep022
876,for all my husband's man things plus,ep022
879,it's got a wet bar how cool is that this,ep022
882,is actually a guest bathroom that's a,ep022
885,really big shower okay,ep022
888,I like it and it connects to a bedroom,ep022
891,so this is like a jack-and-jill between,ep022
894,the bonus and the bedroom it is their,ep022
897,studio space they view a second guest,ep022
900,bedroom and a bath on the way to the,ep022
903,master suite oh gosh huge yeah double,ep022
906,tray ceiling I love the size of this,ep022
909,Megan you gonna love the claws Oh,ep022
912,what it keeps going I'm actually gonna,ep022
915,get any spacing no you're not,ep022
918,and the master is the master bath Oh,ep022
921,which i think is a must for us yeah yes,ep022
924,we got the waterfall shower head and,ep022
927,then a shower head will meet chin that's,ep022
930,crazy I can't even touch the sides yeah,ep022
933,[Music],ep022
936,you know there's a lot I really like,ep022
939,about this house I really like the bonus,ep022
942,room yeah with the bar don't know that,ep022
945,I'm a fan in the backyard I think we,ep022
948,wanted more room to the dog yeah play,ep022
951,fetch some stuff yeah so there is that,ep022
954,as everyone was at a Costco so another,ep022
957,big problem the two-car garage I really,ep022
960,you know here we'd prefer to three-car,ep022
963,garage yeah well I would like a unicorn,ep022
966,and a moat too but you don't see that,ep022
969,happening,ep022
972,you're definitely giving us something to,ep022
975,think about keep in mind guys the market,ep022
978,the way it's been right now if you don't,ep022
981,make a move it may not be here tomorrow,ep022
984,but since they're not ready to pull the,ep022
987,trigger,ep022
990,they risk it and ask Larry to show them,ep022
993,another option this one has JB's,ep022
996,three-car garage but it looks like a,ep022
999,split-level of me you can see where the,ep022
1002,first floor comes out and I see the,ep022
1005,stairs up to landings and you know how I,ep022
1008,feel about split levels okay,ep022
1011,[Music],ep022
1014,I've been waiting to get some barbecue,ep022
1017,gay ever since we cross one of the,ep022
1020,things I miss most about Tennessee was,ep022
1023,the food right working with a budget of,ep022
1026,"$300,000 Megan and JB are relocating to",ep022
1029,Clarksville Tennessee during the rush of,ep022
1032,military move season so far they've seen,ep022
1035,a spacious traditional with a formal,ep022
1038,dining room,ep022
1041,huge bonus room and a big yard but there,ep022
1044,was no fence and the commute to post for,ep022
1047,JB would be law then they saw a new,ep022
1050,construction with the front porch JB,ep022
1053,light the kitchen of Megan's dreams and,ep022
1056,a shorter commute but the yard was small,ep022
1059,and neither home had JB's three-car,ep022
1062,garage so now their brokers come through,ep022
1065,on the garage well it's not traditional,ep022
1068,or colonial it's not my craftsman that,ep022
1071,I'm looking for got a car garage though,ep022
1074,it does have that I'm excited about that,ep022
1077,but it looks like a split-level to me,ep022
1080,you can see where the first floor comes,ep022
1083,out and I see the stairs up to landing,ep022
1086,you know how I feel about split levels,ep022
1089,it just seems weird that I should have,ep022
1092,to walk upstairs to get to the door but,ep022
1095,didn't have to walk up more stairs to,ep022
1098,get into the house I should just be able,ep022
1101,to walk into the house I'm not a huge,ep022
1104,fan of split away or understand it but I,ep022
1107,thought this might be an exception it's,ep022
1110,two hundred and sixty four thousand nine,ep022
1113,hundred actually has five bedrooms and,ep022
1116,three baths okay how close are we to,ep022
1119,post believe it or not less than 10,ep022
1122,minutes and post okay let's go in oh,ep022
1125,yeah see what I mean we came upstairs to,ep022
1128,get to the door now we have to go,ep022
1131,upstairs to get to the house it doesn't,ep022
1134,make sense I know they don't really care,ep022
1137,about the split for you but it is an,ep022
1140,option that they're gonna have to,ep022
1143,consider because of the fact that the,ep022
1146,homes are selling really really fast,ep022
1149,right now foot ceilings yeah I love the,ep022
1152,ceilings and I love this these are,ep022
1155,really nice floors a little tight but,ep022
1158,it's nice the kitchen seems really tight,ep022
1161,to me there,ep022
1164,really small I mean I'm not like a,ep022
1167,kitchen of fishing in Auto but this is,ep022
1170,really tight yeah it just seems like if,ep022
1173,we were entertaining anybody over here,ep022
1176,this kid fill up really quick yeah and,ep022
1179,his actual formal dining room area I do,ep022
1182,think that sonogram yeah this is nice,ep022
1185,yeah and I think this would fit our,ep022
1188,dining room table really well they see a,ep022
1191,guest bedroom full bath and a possible,ep022
1194,radio studio for Meghan okay this could,ep022
1197,be a studio or guest room before,ep022
1200,crossing the house to the master suite,ep022
1203,wow this seems small for a master it's,ep022
1206,gonna be tight fit with what the Kings a,ep022
1209,king-size bed I don't know that we could,ep022
1212,fit that's gonna clean all of our,ep022
1215,bedroom furniture in here let's take a,ep022
1218,look at your closet in your bathroom,ep022
1221,okay well this is a nice master bath you,ep022
1224,got the double vanity I don't like this,ep022
1227,granite,ep022
1230,it looks like rocky road ice cream way,ep022
1233,it's actually marble Oh marble whatever,ep022
1236,granite marble potato potato I don't,ep022
1239,like it it looks dirty now what do you,ep022
1242,think about this I do not like the,ep022
1245,shower that seems very small to me the,ep022
1248,master bathroom is a little strange for,ep022
1251,me not only is the marble and odd color,ep022
1254,which I could get past that but the,ep022
1257,shower how do you do anything in there I,ep022
1260,don't know I don't walk in closet okay,ep022
1263,they head out to see the backyard wow,ep022
1266,this is a nice day yeah I really like,ep022
1269,the deck and the yard,ep022
1272,Wow the yard seems a little small and,ep022
1275,I'm noticing there's not much privacy,ep022
1278,here with the neighbors back inside they,ep022
1281,head downstairs to see two bedrooms on,ep022
1284,the lower level this would be perfect,ep022
1287,for all your man things yeah but you,ep022
1290,know with it being a split-level it just,ep022
1293,feels like I'm being banished to the,ep022
1296,basement I see what you're saying though,ep022
1299,with the tile floors and it's a lot,ep022
1302,cooler down here it does have that,ep022
1305,basement feel you have a lot of extra,ep022
1308,rooms off here this could be great for,ep022
1311,the studio you know that to move better,ep022
1314,was down here,ep022
1317,well welcome to a studio for me in an,ep022
1320,office for you but more importantly if,ep022
1323,without was thinking about when John was,ep022
1326,the tree yeah this is really nice they,ep022
1329,really finished this garage out well,ep022
1332,this is perfect for you hon after seeing,ep022
1335,the three-car garage I get what my,ep022
1338,husband's talking about because we could,ep022
1341,have room for both our vehicles and all,ep022
1344,his man's stuff so his hunting clothes,ep022
1347,and army gear will be crowding the house,ep022
1350,they'll be in the garage it's got a lot,ep022
1353,of great options one is the price well,ep022
1356,below our budget I think that the,ep022
1359,proximity to post and the three-car,ep022
1362,garage really make it an attractive,ep022
1365,option plus it is a very strange yard,ep022
1368,yeah it seems narrow and there's not,ep022
1371,much privacy with the neighbors now you,ep022
1374,know I'm not sure this house really did,ep022
1377,anything to change my mind about wanting,ep022
1380,a split-level it's just something that I,ep022
1383,don't think I could get used to you now,ep022
1386,Meaghan and JB have to decide which,ep022
1389,feature matters most a fenced yard a,ep022
1392,spacious kitchen or being close to post,ep022
1395,we need to make a decision right now,ep022
1398,[Music],ep022
1401,we need to make a decision right now,ep022
1404,"working with a $300,000 budget Megan and",ep022
1407,JB are eager to choose a home before,ep022
1410,supply runs out during military move,ep022
1413,season so let's talk about the,ep022
1416,traditional colonial home alone with a,ep022
1419,big awesome bonus room,ep022
1422,priced at 307 thousand little over,ep022
1425,budget but it had a lot of great things,ep022
1428,about it it had a great yard but not,ep022
1431,fenced not fence it had a fantastic,ep022
1434,kitchen,ep022
1437,oh that kitchen was to die for yep but,ep022
1440,it has the two-car garage not the,ep022
1443,three-car garage and there's that 35,ep022
1446,Plus minute commute to work for me,ep022
1449,so what about the traditional style home,ep022
1452,priced at 269 it did have the two-car,ep022
1455,garage which I don't like I know it,ep022
1458,might not be the big yard we wanted but,ep022
1461,the yard is already fenced as a,ep022
1464,beautiful fence a gorgeous deck and the,ep022
1467,kitchen is fantastic too and it had a,ep022
1470,great bonus space for me and their,ep022
1473,commute to work is really not that bad,ep022
1476,so what did you think about the,ep022
1479,split-level priced at 260 for the entire,ep022
1482,first level felt like it was a basement,ep022
1485,instead of a lower level did really have,ep022
1488,a basement feel to it on the other hand,ep022
1491,though it is incredibly close to post,ep022
1494,yes and it's way below budget yes there,ep022
1497,is that I liked that had the three-car,ep022
1500,garage and it seemed to have plenty of,ep022
1503,options for you as far as a radio studio,ep022
1506,goes with the five bedrooms but that,ep022
1509,backyard was really strange and you were,ep022
1512,so close to the neighbors and there was,ep022
1515,not much privacy in that kitchen was,ep022
1518,really tiny too so that's something to,ep022
1521,think about so which one will they,ep022
1524,choose,ep022
1527,[Music],ep022
1530,I've made up my mind,ep022
1533,have you no I think the new construction,ep022
1536,traditional house is the house for us I,ep022
1539,have to agree with you man,ep022
1542,it's just a better fit for the two of us,ep022
1545,with the three bedrooms all right so,ep022
1548,should we tell Larry we made a decision,ep022
1551,before we head back to kill more of,ep022
1554,these and let's do this okay all right,ep022
1557,let's do it,ep022
1560,ready go two weeks now and it is great,ep022
1563,to finally be settled everything in its,ep022
1566,place and to be back in Tennessee the,ep022
1569,original asking price for this house was,ep022
1572,269 nine and we paid the full asking,ep022
1575,price with the seller pay in closing,ep022
1578,good-morning it's Meghan thank you for,ep022
1581,having us on today my radio studio is,ep022
1584,absolutely perfect but a small space and,ep022
1587,the carpeted floor is perfect for,ep022
1590,acoustics so it's been working out very,ep022
1593,well,ep022
1596,cash loves this house I think he's happy,ep022
1599,anywhere there's a tug of war rope up he,ep022
1602,loves the yard and he seems I feel like,ep022
1605,happier than ever I didn't get the,ep022
1608,three-car garage they wanted but I did,ep022
1611,get an oversized two-car garage so it,ep022
1614,really doesn't affect us that much it's,ep022
1617,nice being back in Tennessee and being,ep022
1620,close to Nashville and close to our,ep022
1623,family of gasps here to your new house,ep022
1626,now you enjoy it oh we planned on it,ep022
12,I love the vintage charm it's beautiful,ep023
15,yeah it's vintage versus modern in,ep023
18,Chicago with Daniella on one side,ep023
21,I love the rug brick I love the,ep023
24,embellishments I love the cute charms,ep023
27,definitely Daniella and her boyfriend,ep023
30,Andrew on the other it's kind of that,ep023
33,more contemporary loft style that that I,ep023
36,look for other challenges for these,ep023
39,urban buyers with a modest budget,ep023
42,in-unit laundry there is no washer/dryer,ep023
45,oh yeah come on really here is a laundry,ep023
48,room do I just left to throw quarters in,ep023
51,it you still need a bag of quarters a,ep023
54,place for the cat box,ep023
57,could we squeeze the Kitty's litter,ep023
60,right in there yeah we're gonna be a,ep023
63,small little box and a large walk-in,ep023
66,shower I know I won't bend it will you,ep023
69,even finish I don't think so actually,ep023
72,this is even small for me,ep023
75,yeah there's no way you're man,ep023
78,[Music],ep023
81,pretty busy at work this week I am I've,ep023
84,got my bosses coming in I got a big,ep023
87,presentation later this week my name is,ep023
90,Andrew I'm 32 years old and I work in,ep023
93,the wine business this is a single,ep023
96,vineyard pinot noir from Central Coast,ep023
99,California,ep023
102,I'm Daniella I'm 29 years old and I work,ep023
105,as a broker for property insurance and,ep023
108,risk management Danielle and I have been,ep023
111,together for a little over three years,ep023
114,living together for two we actually met,ep023
117,on an app I swiped right for her and we,ep023
120,matched okay what do you thinking oh,ep023
123,yeah you'll definitely go with the,ep023
126,vegetarian now the first thing that,ep023
129,caught my eye about Daniela was her,ep023
132,beautiful long dark hair and also her,ep023
135,height I am over six foot four she's 6,ep023
138,foot 2 or so what drew me to Andrew was,ep023
141,his carefree charm and all his travel,ep023
144,pictures we were able to establish a,ep023
147,simple sweet friendship and being that's,ep023
150,a cool vibe in here yeah I actually love,ep023
153,this city the food scene out here is,ep023
156,great the music the art scene is,ep023
159,fantastic there are a ton of summer,ep023
162,activities to choose from on the lake in,ep023
165,Chicago you could go running or biking,ep023
168,or swimming even have one activity,ep023
171,called paddleboard yoga which I love,ep023
174,because I love yoga and I love being on,ep023
177,the water,ep023
180,[Music],ep023
183,for the last two years they've been,ep023
186,living with their cat in a one-bed,ep023
189,one-bath apartment but they're ready for,ep023
192,an upgrade and we've kind of just at,ep023
195,that point where we're ready to find a,ep023
198,home and set some roots and maybe get a,ep023
201,little bit more space so when we were,ep023
204,both were ready to kind of start that,ep023
207,the house hunt I knew the perfect person,ep023
210,to call is my old old buddy Nicholas who,ep023
213,I've known for probably about 10 years,ep023
216,what can you tell me about what you guys,ep023
219,looking for well my dream list is a,ep023
222,vintage home charming Chicago is very,ep023
225,unique and they have a lot of real,ep023
228,estate that includes a lot of old homes,ep023
231,and if we live in Chicago I want to live,ep023
234,in something very unique and vintage to,ep023
237,Chicago and that's I think where we're,ep023
240,gonna differ I definitely want something,ep023
243,a bit more lofty feeling I love the,ep023
246,brick and timber I also love those kind,ep023
249,of new cleaner contemporary style lofts,ep023
252,I like exposed ductwork exposed piping,ep023
255,brick timber feel bigger open spaces I,ep023
258,think it's important for me to have,ep023
261,defined spaces and dedicated rooms I,ep023
264,just feel like each room serves more of,ep023
267,a purpose and you kind of feel that,ep023
270,energy in each space and that's pretty,ep023
273,important to me they want two bedrooms,ep023
276,so Andrew can have a home office and,ep023
279,room to store his wine bottles and he's,ep023
282,particularly adamant about getting two,ep023
285,bathrooms with no shower tub combos it's,ep023
288,hard to find a shower bathtub combo,ep023
291,where the showerhead is high enough for,ep023
294,me to stand under and take a shower,ep023
297,I would love a parking spot and a,ep023
300,washer/dryer unit if you can find it I,ep023
303,do not want to be washing my clothes,ep023
306,with 20 30 40 other people finding,ep023
309,someone else's hair I done with that,ep023
312,daniela meanwhile is hoping for a white,ep023
315,kitchen plus a little space of her own,ep023
318,to have a little private yoga space or a,ep023
321,little relaxation space in the master,ep023
324,bedroom,ep023
327,I definitely like having a lot of,ep023
330,windows and a lot of light in each room,ep023
333,I would like a dedicated space for the,ep023
336,kitty litter in our current rental her,ep023
339,the kitty litter is as soon as you open,ep023
342,the front door you'll kind of almost,ep023
345,step into it so I'm hoping in our next,ep023
348,home that she's a dedicated space that's,ep023
351,kind of out of sight out of my,ep023
354,laughing what did what's your budget,ep023
357,well I think we're gonna differ in that,ep023
360,area as well I'm willing to spend you,ep023
363,know at least 475 on a place as long as,ep023
366,it's you know we're getting what we want,ep023
369,I think we should say close around 400,ep023
372,because I still wanna be able to travel,ep023
375,and have a nice lifestyle in Chicago and,ep023
378,be young and enjoy it,ep023
381,we're gonna need to spend a little bit,ep023
384,more than I think your budget to to be,ep023
387,happy well maybe we'll find that lucky,ep023
390,charm what I hope their agents starting,ep023
393,them off at a place in East Lakeview,ep023
396,that he thinks will make Daniela happy,ep023
399,so the building was built in 1934 I love,ep023
402,the vintage charm isn't it beautiful,ep023
405,yeah I am a little worried cuz it does,ep023
408,look pretty vintage Nick it is so it's a,ep023
411,2-bedroom 2-bath we're looking at,ep023
414,"perfect $410,000 that's perfect yeah it",ep023
417,does not have parking unfortunately okey,ep023
420,so engine parking on the street can be a,ep023
423,little of a challenge around here but,ep023
426,yeah there are options okay okay,ep023
429,assessments are nine hundred thirty,ep023
432,dollars a month Nick Wow,ep023
435,it's a hefty one what is that it,ep023
438,includes everything but electric,ep023
441,everything included that's good but,ep023
444,that's pretty steep assessments that's,ep023
447,what happens with some of these vintage,ep023
450,buildings I mean we have hire a choice a,ep023
453,lot of care and maintenance well I mean,ep023
456,the purchase price is I mean that's way,ep023
459,under budget let's check it out awesome,ep023
462,oh man I love this foyer the archways in,ep023
465,the crown molding I love the vintage,ep023
468,charm yeah it's vintage for sure Nick,ep023
471,let's go check out living room oh this,ep023
474,is beautiful,ep023
477,huh I love the chandelier yeah it's nice,ep023
480,and bright with the light coming in but,ep023
483,Nick already with the vintage I feel,ep023
486,like it's so compartmentalized it's room,ep023
489,to room to room there's no like open,ep023
492,flow to it it is a vintage copper anus,ep023
495,which you get I love it I feel like it's,ep023
498,a proper sitting living room and I love,ep023
501,those big windows too they passed,ep023
504,through the dining room on the way to,ep023
507,the kitchen now this is what I'm talking,ep023
510,about free kitchen I I like this modern,ep023
513,finishes fra you've got yeah granite,ep023
516,countertops you got your white cabinets,ep023
519,stainless steel appliances high-end,ep023
522,refrigerator right on the corner here,ep023
525,built in that little butler's pantry,ep023
528,kind of storage nuke in the back of the,ep023
531,kitchen by the fridge for me is the,ep023
534,perfect place to be able to store my,ep023
537,wine and display it and kind of set up a,ep023
540,little office shop the owner has a cat,ep023
543,as well and they actually just put the,ep023
546,cat litter box in here oh that's,ep023
549,probably people don't come through this,ep023
552,common area yeah I'm glad to see that,ep023
555,I'm not the only cat owner that is,ep023
558,worried about hiding the cat litter,ep023
561,their current setup here would be,ep023
564,perfect for us I don't understand why,ep023
567,this whole litter box thing has become,ep023
570,such an issue in our house hunt is this,ep023
573,just a litter box why can't we just put,ep023
576,it anywhere oh this is big now this is,ep023
579,not the master this is the second,ep023
582,bedroom a second and this is a generous,ep023
585,size room for a vintage condo this is,ep023
588,perfect actually for private yoga space,ep023
591,or your office this is awesome this is,ep023
594,actually exactly we want they see the,ep023
597,guest bathroom just down the hall then,ep023
600,the master bathroom right next to that,ep023
603,okay Nick come on now,ep023
606,a little small I know I won't fit in,ep023
609,there will you even fit a thing so,ep023
612,actually this is even small for me,ep023
615,yeah there's no way oh man yikes I mean,ep023
618,honestly this would have to like be,ep023
621,completely redone we're at the lower end,ep023
624,of our budget so we could probably total,ep023
627,expenses I have a project gonna be,ep023
630,you're probably looking at 10 to 15 I,ep023
633,think if they put a little money into,ep023
636,that master bath it would definitely add,ep023
639,value to their property,ep023
642,I like the two walled windows it's a lot,ep023
645,of light in here Corner unit it's big,ep023
648,space I mean the black walls is very,ep023
651,very interesting mm-hmm,ep023
654,I don't really understand that and then,ep023
657,I mean they have a chandelier over the,ep023
660,bed can we spend a disco ball and yeah,ep023
663,I'm waiting for the washer-dryer haven't,ep023
666,seen that yet there is no washer and,ep023
669,dryer oh yeah come on really there is a,ep023
672,laundry room do I have to throw quarters,ep023
675,in it,ep023
678,you still need a bag of quarters that's,ep023
681,what you get with vintage units I mean,ep023
684,very rarely can you find a place in a,ep023
687,vintage building that has a washer and,ep023
690,dryer they didn't build it the risers in,ep023
693,the stacks can't yeah I know I just I,ep023
696,guess I wasn't expecting that I was,ep023
699,really hoping to have something in unit,ep023
702,but it does have the vintage charm I was,ep023
705,hoping for,ep023
708,I like the defined spaces in the,ep023
711,fireplace the 2-bed 2bath is definitely,ep023
714,um it's a home run here the space the,ep023
717,size of those bedrooms is great but,ep023
720,again no washer/dryer especially no,ep023
723,parking on top of it and that master,ep023
726,bathroom we're gonna have to do some,ep023
729,work on there it definitely is it's,ep023
732,something a little bit more your style,ep023
735,but I'm really looking forward to seeing,ep023
738,something a little bit more my style a,ep023
741,little bit more lofty a little bit more,ep023
744,kind of clean and contemporary with that,ep023
747,in mind their agents now lined up a,ep023
750,place in the River North neighborhood,ep023
753,they look at the building it looks cool,ep023
756,but it doesn't have that vintage charm,ep023
759,that I was hoping for right but it's,ep023
762,kind of that more contemporary loft,ep023
765,style that that I'm looking for,ep023
768,[Music],ep023
771,I don't think you've ever been here I,ep023
774,haven't no heavy this one my favorite,ep023
777,wine bar sits on its run by a woman,ep023
780,Somali a which is great Andrew and,ep023
783,Daniela are buying their first place,ep023
786,together in Chicago he's willing to,ep023
789,spend up to four hundred and seventy,ep023
792,five thousand dollars for something,ep023
795,bigger than their current 1-bed 1-bath,ep023
798,rental but she wants to come in closer,ep023
801,to four hundred thousand so far they've,ep023
804,seen a condo in a 1930s era building in,ep023
807,East Lakeview that had all the vintage,ep023
810,charm that Daniela loved but Andrew is,ep023
813,looking for something more modern so now,ep023
816,their agent Nikolas is taking them to,ep023
819,the River North neighborhood to see,ep023
822,something for Andrew it's a little bit,ep023
825,of a loft building perfect the look at,ep023
828,the building it looks cool but it,ep023
831,doesn't have that vintage charm that I,ep023
834,was hoping for right but it's kind of,ep023
837,that more contemporary loft style that,ep023
840,that I'm looking for price four hundred,ep023
843,thirty thousand okay does not clue to,ep023
846,parking you want the parking it's an,ep023
849,"additional 30,000 it's an extra 30 extra",ep023
852,30 Oh even with parking we're still,ep023
855,within budget so your budget yeah my,ep023
858,budget it's a really expensive though a,ep023
861,little bit let's check it out cool,ep023
864,this is the space tree beautiful looking,ep023
867,courses exactly what I was looking for I,ep023
870,love how open it feels tall ceilings,ep023
873,it's amazing,ep023
876,makes us feel short in here right it's,ep023
879,perfect the kitchen is open to the,ep023
882,dining to the to the entertaining area,ep023
885,we can be here with friends I don't know,ep023
888,it's a lot of exposed concrete and,ep023
891,piping it's not charming at all it's,ep023
894,unfinished kitchen is amazing - it's big,ep023
897,it's open it's way better than what,ep023
900,we're in right - a way bigger but it,ep023
903,doesn't have the white cabinets I wanted,ep023
906,we can paint them well I'm sure you can,ep023
909,pay them I that's not part of the,ep023
912,service no you can definitely paint,ep023
915,these look at the view this cool,ep023
918,chandelier and then there's this little,ep023
921,kind of nook space over here for storage,ep023
924,I could like my wine stuff we could do a,ep023
927,little bar it's just a family room this,ep023
930,is really really small where would our,ep023
933,couch fit here while I'm going to worry,ep023
936,about your couch we're not buying the,ep023
939,condo for your couch we're buying the,ep023
942,condo for you but if you know if you're,ep023
945,sitting here watching TV and I'm cooking,ep023
948,like we can at least still have a,ep023
951,conversation we're not gonna be closed,ep023
954,off from each other which is something,ep023
957,that I I like and you get a ton of light,ep023
960,with these huge windows the light is,ep023
963,nice yeah yeah oh this is awesome it's,ep023
966,perfect what direction is this Watts,ep023
969,West so we would get sunsets yeah it's a,ep023
972,little small but it would be beautiful,ep023
975,to be facing this is a huge plus for me,ep023
978,I like it - and this is your master okay,ep023
981,cool decent size the crown molding it,ep023
984,does look really nice in here yeah it,ep023
987,seems a little bit tight but I do,ep023
990,actually like all the light in here and,ep023
993,then right over here you sure ensuite oh,ep023
996,[Music],ep023
999,I stand up shower not a bathtub Nick,ep023
1002,thank you for that,ep023
1005,so what you wanted yeah and he's cut two,ep023
1008,heads one for me one for you but it is a,ep023
1011,little low I not to squat down watch,ep023
1014,myself no but this is great it's a,ep023
1017,walk-in shower I've got something to,ep023
1020,show you over here okay Oh washer and,ep023
1023,dryer,ep023
1026,perfect could we squeeze Kitty's litter,ep023
1029,right in there we're just it's gonna be,ep023
1032,a small little box they head back,ep023
1035,towards the front of the unit to see the,ep023
1038,guest bathroom and another bedroom,ep023
1041,so this is the second vistas a second by,ep023
1044,hand so it's completely open to here,ep023
1047,completely open there for me it's what I,ep023
1050,need an office space I am just a little,ep023
1053,disappointed because it's it's it's not,ep023
1056,ideal there's no privacy even if you're,ep023
1059,watching TV and I'm sitting here trying,ep023
1062,to do yoga I'm gonna hear everything,ep023
1065,right,ep023
1068,[Music],ep023
1071,I actually love the fact that it's a,ep023
1074,2-bed 2bath I love the open kind of loft,ep023
1077,floor plan I love the fact that you,ep023
1080,found this washer/dryer and unit that,ep023
1083,second bedroom is not exactly what I'm,ep023
1086,looking for that balcony is a little,ep023
1089,small and so is that living room area I,ep023
1092,like all the tall ceilings and the fact,ep023
1095,that there's a lot of light in the unit,ep023
1098,and the crown molding in the bedroom is,ep023
1101,a nice touch but it doesn't have that,ep023
1104,vintage charm I was hoping for,ep023
1107,do you have anything else to show us I'm,ep023
1110,always up for looking at real estate so,ep023
1113,now the search continues back in East,ep023
1116,Lakeview,ep023
1119,I love the rug brick I love the,ep023
1122,embellishments I love the cute charm not,ep023
1125,exactly what I was we could take a look,ep023
1128,[Music],ep023
1131,about one of these oh you know she loves,ep023
1134,these crazy for that one is pink her,ep023
1137,color it is it is okay cat owners,ep023
1140,Daniella and Andrew our condo hunting in,ep023
1143,"Chicago with different budgets 475,000",ep023
1146,"for him and 400,000 for her so far",ep023
1149,they've seen a place in East Lake you,ep023
1152,that had the vintage charm that Daniela,ep023
1155,is looking for and a loft style unit in,ep023
1158,River North with the modern touches that,ep023
1161,Andrew likes,ep023
1164,now their agent Nikolas has found,ep023
1167,another option in East Lake View to show,ep023
1170,them I love the rug brick I love the,ep023
1173,embellishments I love the cute charms is,ep023
1176,definitely Daniela pick I believe it's a,ep023
1179,hundred-year-old building not exactly,ep023
1182,what I was looking for but we could take,ep023
1185,a look keep an open mind I think this is,ep023
1188,something I actually like now it is only,ep023
1191,a 2-bedroom 1-bath one-bath but only,ep023
1194,"380,000 and the suspects are only 270 so",ep023
1197,it's a good deal right up our alley J,ep023
1200,okay I'm beautiful I love the hardwood,ep023
1203,floors a window good light but I just,ep023
1206,feel like we're closed off from the rest,ep023
1209,of the continent like what I give people,ep023
1212,over we're entertaining but this space,ep023
1215,is so big like our couch could totally,ep023
1218,fit right here we can diagonal at this,ep023
1221,point have the TV up here and the,ep023
1224,vintage vents those are adorable and its,ep023
1227,charm,ep023
1230,it's just a little vintage II for me,ep023
1233,let's check out the rest okay oh wow,ep023
1236,so it is a second bedroom there cause,ep023
1239,the second bedroom you really do,ep023
1242,anything you want I mean look at the,ep023
1245,details of the doors doors I have,ep023
1248,puzzles to do a desk I mean that's kind,ep023
1251,of like a little perfect for a desk or a,ep023
1254,closet or for all like the wines that I,ep023
1257,have to make those shelves in there for,ep023
1260,the storage this spot actually would be,ep023
1263,perfect for the letterbox we can kind of,ep023
1266,hide it somehow in the office away you,ep023
1269,have a little bit of a shield okay I,ep023
1272,guess if there's no other place to put,ep023
1275,it it could work now this is your only,ep023
1278,bath this is a good size so it is it's,ep023
1281,only a one bath in late for you you're,ep023
1284,not gonna get two bathrooms for three or,ep023
1287,"99,000 and unit that's this upgraded it",ep023
1290,nice and it's a tub we typically well,ep023
1293,now it's a tub uh I hate having to step,ep023
1296,in at least this is high I haven't taken,ep023
1299,a bath since I was two years old we,ep023
1302,don't need a bath a stand-up shower is,ep023
1305,much more practical for what we need,ep023
1308,right here is actually your washer and,ep023
1311,dryer,ep023
1314,oh wow why should we dryer something for,ep023
1317,me but I'm assuming this is the formal,ep023
1320,dining room so it's a bit strange to,ep023
1323,have the laundry room in our dining room,ep023
1326,right,ep023
1329,do you wanna laundry at least we have it,ep023
1332,right it's true,ep023
1335,what do you think of the kitchen it's a,ep023
1338,little darker than I want don't like why,ep023
1341,are the kitchen cabinets different,ep023
1344,colors that makes no sense quite a bit,ep023
1347,of granite it is it is the Granite City,ep023
1350,in here this is something you could do,ep023
1353,down the road you don't have to do it,ep023
1356,right away but I was really hoping for,ep023
1359,like a white light nice kitchen this,ep023
1362,would be a lot of work probably a lot of,ep023
1365,money it's awesome it's like our own,ep023
1368,little oasis back here this is perfect,ep023
1371,well it is shared but I mean this is a,ep023
1374,pretty generous and Nick so what is this,ep023
1377,building right here this building has a,ep023
1380,private garage spot right there,ep023
1383,this comes with come comes with it,ep023
1386,included that is amazing all right so,ep023
1389,this is the master bedroom right here,ep023
1392,okay it might be a little tight but if,ep023
1395,we put the bed against that wall I think,ep023
1398,a good fan got your fun little vintage,ep023
1401,architecture over here I'm sure you love,ep023
1404,that this is cute I can have a little,ep023
1407,yoga Ngoc put my mat and little candle,ep023
1410,and table in here yeah that's very cool,ep023
1413,yoga this is your yoga space yes clean I,ep023
1416,[Music],ep023
1419,love that it's a vintage condo and it's,ep023
1422,a great price yeah I mean for being,ep023
1425,vintage I've got my parking spot I get,ep023
1428,an outdoor space and then they get,ep023
1431,washer/dryer in unit I don't like the,ep023
1434,fact that it's so closed off I wish it,ep023
1437,was a little bit more open the master,ep023
1440,bedroom was pretty cramped in my opinion,ep023
1443,I don't love that the laundry room is in,ep023
1446,our formal dining room didn't love the,ep023
1449,dark kitchen but the most negative thing,ep023
1452,that is really one bath,ep023
1455,since they can't get everything they,ep023
1458,both want it may come down to Daniela's,ep023
1461,vintage style and Andrews in-unit,ep023
1464,laundry and two bathrooms,ep023
1467,we are ready it is time to make a,ep023
1470,decision so all right we are on it,ep023
1473,sharpen our pencils,ep023
1476,[Music],ep023
1479,are we excited we are it's a big day,ep023
1482,very excited yes,ep023
1485,Andrew and Daniella are looking for a,ep023
1488,condo in Chicago with a budget of,ep023
1491,"$400,000 for her and four hundred and",ep023
1494,seventy five thousand dollars for him,ep023
1497,they've seen several possibilities now,ep023
1500,they're meeting with their agents to,ep023
1503,make a decision let's talk about the,ep023
1506,"vintage high-rise it was for $10,000 you",ep023
1509,got two bedrooms two baths,ep023
1512,no parking I did like how big it was and,ep023
1515,the vintage feel of it and I kitchens,ep023
1518,beautiful in that second bedroom for me,ep023
1521,was pretty perfect but those bedrooms,ep023
1524,are really small and there's no,ep023
1527,washer/dryer in that their second option,ep023
1530,is a modern loft style unit priced at,ep023
1533,four hundred and thirty thousand dollars,ep023
1536,plus an extra thirty thousand for a,ep023
1539,parking spot it was a little bit more my,ep023
1542,sandwich I really enjoyed it was an open,ep023
1545,floor plan I did like the tall ceilings,ep023
1548,and the master bedroom and at crown,ep023
1551,molding which was really nice but it was,ep023
1554,that concrete left unfinished feeling I,ep023
1557,didn't really like it all the,ep023
1560,washer/dryer stackable in unit was,ep023
1563,absolutely perfect,ep023
1566,honestly though that that living space I,ep023
1569,was concerned about the size of it so,ep023
1572,now we have the vintage walk-up right,ep023
1575,Breanna and Alison which is definitely,ep023
1578,on the lower end of our budget,ep023
1581,and includes parking spot well I think,ep023
1584,the price is perfect obviously for our,ep023
1587,budget and the vintage feel the kitchen,ep023
1590,doesn't have the white cabinets that I,ep023
1593,was hoping for,ep023
1596,it does have laundry in Union but it's,ep023
1599,so like compartmentalised from room to,ep023
1602,room to room just the fact that it only,ep023
1605,has one bathroom I don't know if it's,ep023
1608,gonna work for us so what do you think,ep023
1611,[Music],ep023
1614,that vintage walk-up condo I mean that,ep023
1617,price point is so attractive and this,ep023
1620,one walking in it just felt like the,ep023
1623,most homey that's true I mean if it if,ep023
1626,it's something that makes you really,ep023
1629,really happy if that's what you want I'm,ep023
1632,okay with that I'm gonna need to make a,ep023
1635,phone call I'm pretty sure that this,ep023
1638,property's going to multiple offers it's,ep023
1641,a negotiating game welcomes again okay,ep023
1644,it's pretty bright color so it's a,ep023
1647,little different than I thought it would,ep023
1650,be when moved in about two to three,ep023
1653,weeks ago and as we're getting settled,ep023
1656,and unpacking I kind of love it more and,ep023
1659,more as we go along,ep023
1662,I'm really happy well I do like the,ep023
1665,colors but yeah I think the thickness of,ep023
1668,this may not work yeah Danijela,ep023
1671,definitely one she got her vintage condo,ep023
1674,but this place definitely won me over,ep023
1677,with a few things in terms of size two,ep023
1680,bedrooms it has that parking it has the,ep023
1683,washer/dryer how many do we have now one,ep023
1686,two three five five yeah five chairs,ep023
1689,that was able to paint the cabinet's,ep023
1692,which was actually kind of fun and it,ep023
1695,gave her her white cabinet so I think,ep023
1698,Robbie they turned out really nice I,ep023
1701,have to say it looks really good yeah,ep023
1704,good job well how many more there's only,ep023
1707,only eighteen more to do only a couple I,ep023
1710,love the master bedroom especially the,ep023
1713,little nook with the window and that's,ep023
1716,the perfect amount of space for closets,ep023
1719,and wardrobe and also a little yoga,ep023
1722,space for me,ep023
1725,the second bedroom has exceeded my,ep023
1728,expectations it's exactly what I want,ep023
1731,it's it's a private space for me to get,ep023
1734,work done oh yeah actually we are moved,ep023
1737,in and the office it's coming along,ep023
1740,few more things to buy still I think,ep023
1743,Molina is starting to love this place,ep023
1746,Crayola we have our kitty litter in the,ep023
1749,guest room which is perfect nook and,ep023
1752,perfect hideaway space for her I'm in,ep023
1755,there working kitty comes in she goes to,ep023
1758,work we make it we make it work you got,ep023
1761,every time I think she loves it here you,ep023
1764,have been very particular about what you,ep023
1767,wanted and I've never seen you've been,ep023
1770,so strong about your opinion I cannot,ep023
1773,but I know what I love do you sure do,ep023
1776,now I know,ep023
12,[Music],ep024
15,Kirsten is a bigger risk taker than Joel,ep024
18,I'm a bit more of a pros and cons person,ep024
21,so it wasn't easy swaying him to leave,ep024
24,his career in Japan or her new job in,ep024
27,Greece live here but if Joel's going to,ep024
30,get fully onboard with moving to the,ep024
33,exotic island of Crete if we live it,ep024
36,downtown Tonya this is all at our,ep024
39,fingertips you'll need to find ways to,ep024
42,make it comfortable,ep024
45,oh yes missus yes is this beautiful,ep024
48,Jeanie just I'm not really sure to where,ep024
51,we're gonna store my tools and equipment,ep024
54,I love my wife but she can be a bit,ep024
57,impulsive sometimes this is the location,ep024
60,I was imagining but the road noise is so,ep024
63,loud in the middle of nowhere,ep024
66,hey it has a microwave and a coffee pot,ep024
69,you're really trying to sell this place,ep024
72,on me aren't you,ep024
75,Joel is definitely more of a country boy,ep024
78,but you're only in Chania once,ep024
81,[Music],ep024
84,Wow this really where we're staying we,ep024
87,met in college he just smiled it's,ep024
90,really big at me just a smile as well,ep024
93,and I was just like oh he's so cute,ep024
96,ah perfect temperature I think she,ep024
99,complements me very well because she,ep024
102,helps me expand outside my comfort zone,ep024
105,quite a bit I think we could just stay,ep024
108,here okay I am a licensed professional,ep024
111,clinical counselor and I could do that,ep024
114,anywhere so initially we moved to Japan,ep024
117,and it was a wonderful wonderful,ep024
120,experience so when an opportunity came,ep024
123,along to do the same thing in Ponyo,ep024
126,we're just ready to experience something,ep024
129,completely different we didn't know a,ep024
132,whole lot about crete before we moved,ep024
135,here we've researched things to do and a,ep024
138,lot of it was outdoorsy and adventurous,ep024
141,which is you like to be outside and,ep024
144,doing the per share so from first glance,ep024
147,and Schurz we were like yep we could see,ep024
150,ourselves there this is downtown can you,ep024
153,see why I want to live here I love my,ep024
156,wife,ep024
159,but she can be a bit impulsive sometimes,ep024
162,look at all these restaurants love it,ep024
165,when she makes decisions with her gut I,ep024
168,have to use some logic and decide if,ep024
171,it's gonna be a good decision or not if,ep024
174,we live in downtown Hanyu this is all at,ep024
177,our fingertips mmm,ep024
180,located on Crete the largest Greek,ep024
183,island and fifth largest in the,ep024
186,Mediterranean Hanyu has a rich and,ep024
189,diverse history Kenya is really charming,ep024
192,city with the Venetian harbour hundreds,ep024
195,of tiny little shops who will,ep024
198,cobblestone roads good to see a lot of,ep024
201,the Turkish Italy,ep024
204,chuck's actually had this place for,ep024
207,about 400 years there's been so much,ep024
210,tourism so many people coming into the,ep024
213,country it is quite expensive to find,ep024
216,property is close to the city centre we,ep024
219,need at least three bedrooms and I need,ep024
222,a yard for our dogs that Spence tin two,ep024
225,important characters in our lives are,ep024
228,our fur babies they're gonna love it,ep024
231,here ideally I would like to live in,ep024
234,Chania it'd be so great to just be able,ep024
237,to walk into town and have that,ep024
240,adventure at our front door you know I,ep024
243,would love to find a home that is more,ep024
246,quiet doesn't have to be in Chania for,ep024
249,me I like to be a little bit more out in,ep024
252,the country with maybe a bigger house I,ep024
255,also really want a garage I am a home,ep024
258,brewer so I have a lot of equipment it's,ep024
261,a lot yeah so it's important for me that,ep024
264,I have a place to work on my hobby what,ep024
267,type of budget I'll be looking at under,ep024
270,"$1,500 per month but I'm a little blue",ep024
273,sir when it comes to the budget because,ep024
276,I'm the money guy in our relationship so,ep024
279,I have to keep you know the reins on,ep024
282,things they've got this dream but it's,ep024
285,little bit impossible,ep024
288,jeanny starts with a property in the,ep024
291,city that's sure to please Kirsten but,ep024
294,the urban hustle and bustle might be too,ep024
297,much for Joel the property I'm going to,ep024
300,show you now is about five minutes from,ep024
303,the city of Chania awesome yes three,ep024
306,bedrooms three bathrooms this is the,ep024
309,location I was imagining I mean we're,ep024
312,five minutes walk from downtown but the,ep024
315,noise coming off of the street is really,ep024
318,loud but does the house come with a,ep024
321,garage yes okay great how much does it,ep024
324,cost per month it's 1800 yeah that's,ep024
327,definitely over our budget I want to,ep024
330,look at it,ep024
333,[Music],ep024
336,oh wow oh my gosh this is amazing,ep024
339,and these hardwood floors are beautiful,ep024
342,how old is the house do you know it's,ep024
345,200 years old yeah and it's been,ep024
348,renovate five or six years ago oh that's,ep024
351,perfect yeah that's really neat okay so,ep024
354,this is the kitchen okay oh the counter,ep024
357,space is really nice and I do like how,ep024
360,modern and new it is but yeah it's a bit,ep024
363,small takes a little bit of getting used,ep024
366,to,ep024
369,sure so this is the main bedroom it's,ep024
372,got enough space I think mm-hmm but wow,ep024
375,that view is something special you have,ep024
378,the views great but you can really hear,ep024
381,the traffic coming up from the street,ep024
384,but Tanya is right there so the Sirians,ep024
387,suite Wow it's a very modern bathroom,ep024
390,Wow look at the light that's cool,ep024
393,my eyes are drawn to this sink fantastic,ep024
396,this is your outdoor area it's not bad,ep024
399,it's a little small there's grass for,ep024
402,the dogs no this is not what I had in,ep024
405,mind for being able to let the dogs out,ep024
408,and just run around the yard but I,ep024
411,absolutely loved the location the view,ep024
414,is spectacular it's walking distance to,ep024
417,downtown it's just everything I dreamed,ep024
420,about when we moved here and I do really,ep024
423,appreciate that the house has a garage,ep024
426,but I'm a little concerned that it's,ep024
429,$300 over what our budget is and it,ep024
432,doesn't even have a yard for our dogs to,ep024
435,run around in,ep024
438,and the road noise is so loud you can,ep024
441,hear it outside and even inside the,ep024
444,house too,ep024
447,one of the sacrifices for being close to,ep024
450,the center is you're gonna have road,ep024
453,noise okay use to it I would definitely,ep024
456,prefer hearing the waves crashing on the,ep024
459,B to the traffic noise coming off the,ep024
462,road to give Joel the peace and quiet he,ep024
465,craves génial need to see how far,ep024
468,Karstens willing to go this is in the,ep024
471,middle of nowhere when a job prospect,ep024
474,came up in Chania greece Karstens,ep024
477,impulsive instincts kicked in so you see,ep024
480,and she swayed joel to leave his career,ep024
483,in japan behind to take it Crete is such,ep024
486,a beautiful island you have everything,ep024
489,from the beaches to a city life to the,ep024
492,mountains in the background so you walk,ep024
495,outside and you're just awestruck,ep024
498,there's a lot of code hurts or some,ep024
501,sheep can you rustic Japan is much,ep024
504,busier it's more built up but here,ep024
507,everything is just so much more,ep024
510,laid-back it's so different Kirsten can,ep024
513,usually convince Joel to buy into her,ep024
516,plans Wow that view is something special,ep024
519,look at that but just because he made,ep024
522,the move doesn't mean he's completely,ep024
525,sold on the idea yet yeah the view is,ep024
528,great but you can really hear the,ep024
531,traffic coming up from the street but,ep024
534,Tanja is right there,ep024
537,I think Kirsten will weigh different,ep024
540,options then I would and she just values,ep024
543,being in the center of things a little,ep024
546,more than what our budget is it's just,ep024
549,everything I dreamed about when we moved,ep024
552,here I'm gonna spend that much money,ep024
555,then this is not what I had in mind for,ep024
558,being able to let the dogs out and just,ep024
561,run around the yard I get the concept of,ep024
564,a budget I just you know we want to,ep024
567,enjoy where we live here I can,ep024
570,understand Joel's point of view she's,ep024
573,gonna be at home is worried about the,ep024
576,financial situation so yes I'd like to,ep024
579,fix something so that it will be,ep024
582,acceptable to Joel this is in the middle,ep024
585,of nowhere how far away is downtown,ep024
588,Hanyang it's about 30 40 minutes,ep024
591,Kirstin Zorba's mountain right in front,ep024
594,of you and Joe look at your garden that,ep024
597,yard is perfect for the dogs and just go,ep024
600,to garage sounds good to me I see two,ep024
603,different units here which house is it,ep024
606,both of them belong to you it's the,ep024
609,"entire property but it's $1,500 a month",ep024
612,that's right on budget that's great well,ep024
615,I guess we have to see it so this is the,ep024
618,first floor this is very nice he's very,ep024
621,open very spacious but this kitchen is,ep024
624,interesting have you ever seen a wooden,ep024
627,countertop before it just doesn't make,ep024
630,sense it's all the cooking that I do I,ep024
633,mean is this even an appropriate cook,ep024
636,surface this is what you're gonna find,ep024
639,Ewing grease it has a dishwasher a,ep024
642,microwave and a coffee pot you're really,ep024
645,trying to sell this place on me aren't,ep024
648,you oh my goodness anything with,ep024
651,extremely remote dole would be all about,ep024
654,so this is the master bedroom plane but,ep024
657,it's a pretty good space yeah is there,ep024
660,not a nun suite no unfortunately there's,ep024
663,a separate bathroom well it's not an,ep024
666,ensuite but I'll take it,ep024
669,this house does have a lot of space,ep024
672,maybe she can just get used to crossing,ep024
675,the hallway to go to the bathroom,ep024
678,and this is the second tool it's genius,ep024
681,exactly the same same wooden countertop,ep024
684,same layout,ep024
687,check out the ceilings I mean this is,ep024
690,different than downstairs yeah that is,ep024
693,true,ep024
696,this gives it a lot of character and,ep024
699,even more space that's a lot to maintain,ep024
702,and you know do we need that repetition,ep024
705,so that was kind of odd,ep024
708,check out that view over there oh my,ep024
711,gosh we've got the Sun rising over,ep024
714,Zorba's Mountain you've got the Sun,ep024
717,setting over the Mediterranean I would,ep024
720,definitely prefer hearing the waves,ep024
723,crashing on the beach to the traffic,ep024
726,noise coming off the road I know but it,ep024
729,might be a small price to pay for that,ep024
732,downtown Hanyu spot joel is definitely,ep024
735,more of a country boy and I'm more of,ep024
738,the city gal so it wasn't what I had in,ep024
741,mind the layout this home is different,ep024
744,you know I'm not used to seeing a bottom,ep024
747,floor natok sword with the same floor,ep024
750,plan but I love it I love the yard I,ep024
753,love the space and I love that it's,ep024
756,right at our budget it has a garage I,ep024
759,can definitely picture us living here,ep024
762,this house has so many things on his,ep024
765,checklist that he's more than happy to,ep024
768,settle but I had a heart set on living,ep024
771,in downtown Hanyu and it was like deja,ep024
774,vu we're on the second floor which was,ep024
777,still kind of weird to me but I just,ep024
780,wanted to show you how much more you,ep024
783,could get for your money if you oughta,ep024
786,listen to her,ep024
789,yes this is beautiful Jeanie Joel and,ep024
792,Kirsten are now more confused than ever,ep024
795,it has just about everything that we,ep024
798,need about which direction they should,ep024
801,go it's just a little bit small and we,ep024
804,can't walk to downtown Hanyu I don't,ep024
807,know what we're gonna do is difficult,ep024
810,decision Thurston's adventurous spirit,ep024
813,was ready for a new experience so she,ep024
816,persuaded Joel to leave Japan for her,ep024
819,job in Chania Greece moving from Japan,ep024
822,we have to it just not only to want me,ep024
825,to a new job and to just a new culture I,ep024
828,also don't have a job yet so this is,ep024
831,gonna be so incredibly different my,ep024
834,career is at stake I feel like I'm in,ep024
837,the prime of my working life and so,ep024
840,giving up something that I've been doing,ep024
843,for five years - not knowing what I'm,ep024
846,gonna be doing is kind of a scary,ep024
849,feeling I'm a natural optimist and I,ep024
852,have a lot of dreams and hopes and I'm,ep024
855,more excited about making drastic,ep024
858,decisions I think that's just more in my,ep024
861,nature I'm a bit more of a pros and cons,ep024
864,person but there's a lot of things that,ep024
867,I probably wouldn't do if she wasn't,ep024
870,there to kind of pull me along and say,ep024
873,this is a great opportunity let's do,ep024
876,this,ep024
879,Joel's willing to expand his comfort,ep024
882,zone to give Kirsten an immersive Greek,ep024
885,experience this is the location I was,ep024
888,imagining but he has needs as well how,ep024
891,much does it cost per month its 1800 -,ep024
894,yeah that's definitely over our budget,ep024
897,it was important to me that while I look,ep024
900,for jobs I find a house that has the,ep024
903,things that are important to me like a,ep024
906,place that I can brew my beer and is,ep024
909,more quiet this is in the middle of,ep024
912,nowhere,ep024
915,I would definitely prefer hearing the,ep024
918,waves crashing on the beach - the,ep024
921,traffic noise coming off the road which,ep024
924,unit visit they both fuels having two,ep024
927,apartments that just feels kind of odd,ep024
930,to me that's a lot to maintain and you,ep024
933,know do we need that repetition there it,ep024
936,has a dishwasher a microwave and a,ep024
939,coffee pot you're really trying to sell,ep024
942,this place on me aren't you oh my,ep024
945,goodness anything extremely remote dole,ep024
948,will be all about but at the same time,ep024
951,you're only in Chania once it's quite,ep024
954,challenging trying to find a home that,ep024
957,they both like so we've got to try and,ep024
960,get something that's gonna fit their,ep024
963,budget and somewhere where they'll both,ep024
966,be able to compromise this property that,ep024
969,I'm going to show you now is in a very,ep024
972,quiet neighborhood this is a great,ep024
975,property for the dogs yeah it has a nice,ep024
978,big yard over there but looks a bit like,ep024
981,a vacation home this is a three bedroom,ep024
984,apartment two bathrooms,ep024
987,it's got swimming pool that sounds,ep024
990,fantastic,ep024
993,just so that you do know it's a communal,ep024
996,area so we share it with the other yes,ep024
999,okay but it really is quiet out here,ep024
1002,but how close is this place to Downtown,ep024
1005,Hanyu it's about 15 minutes on these,ep024
1008,roads it's not really walkable yeah but,ep024
1011,we can drive into the city anytime we,ep024
1014,want to but does the house come with a,ep024
1017,garage unfortunately not,ep024
1020,"but this one is 1,400 a month that's",ep024
1023,awesome okay let's have a look oh look,ep024
1026,at this kitchen I like it yes I love,ep024
1029,that it's opened into the rest of the,ep024
1032,space,ep024
1035,good countertops I can see myself,ep024
1038,cooking in this space okay it's a bit of,ep024
1041,a blank slate no but we can dress this,ep024
1044,up and make it our own don't know how,ep024
1047,homey it feels like I think I have to,ep024
1050,load up a few pillows I could come up,ep024
1053,with stuff for you to do keep you off,ep024
1056,the couch wait until you see this yeah,ep024
1059,and check out this yard I can definitely,ep024
1062,see the dogs playing and running around,ep024
1065,gosh the dogs would love it down there I,ep024
1068,think I speak for both of us when I say,ep024
1071,that when we saw that view it's just,ep024
1074,like heart-stopper to me that's Greece,ep024
1077,that's what we were anticipating when we,ep024
1080,came here and here is you master bedroom,ep024
1083,okay it's a nice room but it's just,ep024
1086,really small so this is your bathroom,ep024
1089,it's so cute I mean I like the tile a,ep024
1092,lot Jeanie it's just there's just not,ep024
1095,enough room for our stuff oh yes yes yes,ep024
1098,oh yes is this beautiful Jeanie I can,ep024
1101,absolutely imagine waking up and being,ep024
1104,here with this view it has just about,ep024
1107,everything that we need has a yard for,ep024
1110,the dogs and it's under budget it's just,ep024
1113,a little bit small on the inside and I'm,ep024
1116,not really sure where we're gonna be,ep024
1119,able to store all my tools and equipment,ep024
1122,and the other thing we can't walk to,ep024
1125,downtown Hanyu it's not in the city but,ep024
1128,it's so peaceful and tranquil out here I,ep024
1131,mean this would be such a great place,ep024
1134,call it our home I just wonder where,ep024
1137,you're gonna put all your stuff the calm,ep024
1140,country or the busy city choosing,ep024
1143,between the two is a question of whose,ep024
1146,personality,ep024
1149,when out in the end I think my vote,ep024
1152,should count for something I'll,ep024
1155,definitely make sure joel has a voice I,ep024
1158,just want to make sure he hears mine too,ep024
1161,[Music],ep024
1164,alright Karstens confidence that,ep024
1167,starting a new life on the Greek island,ep024
1170,of Crete with only her income will work,ep024
1173,out for her and Joel that's stunning,ep024
1176,does that mean you wouldn't live close,ep024
1179,to Zorba's Mountain for that don't you,ep024
1182,uh-huh,ep024
1185,with Joel's laid-back demeanor flashing,ep024
1188,with Karstens outgoing personality but,ep024
1191,we can drive here every weekend just,ep024
1194,like we can drive to the city deciding,ep024
1197,between the quiet country or the vibrant,ep024
1200,city of Chania isn't going to be easy,ep024
1203,Kirsten feels living centrally is the,ep024
1206,best way to experience Greek culture and,ep024
1209,house ones only a short stroll away the,ep024
1212,downtown property clearly I love the,ep024
1215,location but it was $300 over budget and,ep024
1218,the road noise was just so loud you can,ep024
1221,hear it outside and even inside the,ep024
1224,house too,ep024
1227,it's just everything I dream about when,ep024
1230,we moved here and one of the sacrifices,ep024
1233,for being close to the center is you're,ep024
1236,gonna have road though it's cool he used,ep024
1239,to it joel plans to pass the time until,ep024
1242,he finds work by watching their dogs and,ep024
1245,home brewing beer and house two gives,ep024
1248,him plenty of room to do both the twin,ep024
1251,level house it had a lot of things that,ep024
1254,i was looking for and it was right on,ep024
1257,budget downfall 30 to 40 minute drive,ep024
1260,into the city center,ep024
1263,and don't you take the layouts weird,ep024
1266,well Damien is exactly the same is below,ep024
1269,for sure that's a lot to maintain and do,ep024
1272,we need that repetition their house 3 is,ep024
1275,the only option that helps them find at,ep024
1278,least some common ground I mean that,ep024
1281,view was amazing,ep024
1284,it pull is gorgeous oh yes oh yes this,ep024
1287,is beautiful Jeanne it's just a little,ep024
1290,bit small on the inside and I'm not,ep024
1293,really sure where we're gonna be able to,ep024
1296,store all my tools and equipment and we,ep024
1299,can't walk to downtown Hanyu hat but is,ep024
1302,something that we're gonna really have,ep024
1305,to consider,ep024
1308,[Music],ep024
1311,so we can narrow down the field let's,ep024
1314,eliminate the pool apartment yeah I,ep024
1317,agree,ep024
1320,no garage to put your stuff and it still,ep024
1323,was pretty far outside the city yeah,ep024
1326,[Music],ep024
1329,that's downtown property it's the,ep024
1332,location that we had in mind you know,ep024
1335,it's walking distance to all the shops,ep024
1338,and the restaurants and the culture and,ep024
1341,the size and the history of that house,ep024
1344,was just all I could ever want I know,ep024
1347,"but it's $1,800 a month that's a small",ep024
1350,price to pay in the grand scheme of,ep024
1353,things to have that Greek experience but,ep024
1356,I really just can't picture myself,ep024
1359,sitting on that patio that traffic and,ep024
1362,road noise was really loud the twin,ep024
1365,level house has so much to offer I'm,ep024
1368,concerned because a 30 to 40 minute,ep024
1371,drive away from downtown Hanyu really,ep024
1374,felt like it was in the middle of,ep024
1377,nowhere but it's really peaceful and,ep024
1380,quiet and it's right on budget having,ep024
1383,two levels that were exactly the same,ep024
1386,two kitchens two wooden countertops that,ep024
1389,was weird I don't know if I need all,ep024
1392,that yeah I can understand how you feel,ep024
1395,that but it has a garage a great yard,ep024
1398,and it has that view I'm gonna be,ep024
1401,spending a lot of time at home with the,ep024
1404,dogs and I can just see myself sitting,ep024
1407,up on the patio and looking down and,ep024
1410,watching the dogs running around in that,ep024
1413,fenced-in yard I definitely can't deny,ep024
1416,that the twin level house has the best,ep024
1419,yard for the dogs and you've sacrificed,ep024
1422,so much to give up your career to follow,ep024
1425,my career to Greece and I want to make,ep024
1428,sure you have a space that feels,ep024
1431,comfortable and gives you,ep024
1434,so I can sacrifice downtown Tania I,ep024
1437,really think we're gonna be happy there,ep024
1440,I know we will I think it got one really,ep024
1443,[Music],ep024
1446,[Applause],ep024
1449,so are these from we are so happy with,ep024
1452,our decision moving here this is one,ep024
1455,colony yes and this is five years what,ep024
1458,wow,ep024
1461,I realized it is possible to drive yeah,ep024
1464,I still get that downtown five and it,ep024
1467,really has turned out to be a great,ep024
1470,thing it's the very soul Oh how's the,ep024
1473,project come in oh it's going really,ep024
1476,well now that we're settled into a great,ep024
1479,house life is definitely different for,ep024
1482,me I got a job sure beats being a,ep024
1485,full-time dog walker this house has,ep024
1488,everything that we were looking for sit,ep024
1491,go get it it's really nice to have a,ep024
1494,fenced-in yard the garage the garage,ep024
1497,definitely provides enough space for,ep024
1500,Jewel's equipment we've moved in to the,ep024
1503,upstairs apartment and we use the,ep024
1506,downstairs as a guest room for anyone,ep024
1509,that comes to visit us a guest quarters,ep024
1512,really turns out there's a lot of perks,ep024
1515,living out in the country we've already,ep024
1518,made lots of really good friends,ep024
1521,we have this wonderful Greek community,ep024
1524,around us and we just couldn't be,ep024
1527,happier,ep024
1530,[Music],ep024
12,[Music],ep025
15,in the kitchen and talk to you while,ep025
18,you're making dinner or I can sit in the,ep025
21,living room and talk to you while you're,ep025
24,making dinner or make dinner,ep025
27,finding common ground on their house,ep025
30,hunt is no easy task,ep025
33,for these Pittsburgh newlyweds it's just,ep025
36,like with setting to a Stephen King,ep025
39,novel like a fairy tale with Chayton,ep025
42,wanting modern and Maria pushing for a,ep025
45,historical home these light fixtures are,ep025
48,original and beautiful and you can't get,ep025
51,them anywhere else this is literally,ep025
54,like living in a parking garage that's,ep025
57,certain and each house having some,ep025
60,unusual twists oh my god what is,ep025
63,happening over there okay no no no not,ep025
66,at all oh can they find a place they,ep025
69,both like there's going to open flame,ep025
72,there is doors of this or frankly beyond,ep025
75,my own comprehension,ep025
78,[Music],ep025
81,I haven't meanie one my name is Maria,ep025
84,and I'm an internal medicine visit,ep025
87,matter,ep025
90,my last patients at five good my name is,ep025
93,Shaitan I'm a database consultant in,ep025
96,Pittsburgh and we've been married for,ep025
99,nine months we actually met at a bar I,ep025
102,keep trying to come up with a better,ep025
105,story I was a waitress is in fact,ep025
108,actually told me through the doctor and,ep025
111,I was very excited by that and being us,ep025
114,talking him oh no don't go,ep025
117,we were dating about a week and he says,ep025
120,you should probably just give me a key,ep025
123,to your apartment and I was like I I,ep025
126,haven't ruled out the years Eureka you,ep025
129,are so good at this it is very annoying,ep025
132,things like it's practical and so as I,ep025
135,got to know me more like it's just,ep025
138,everything with Keaton is very practical,ep025
141,so if it makes sense and is convenient,ep025
144,that's that's what he thinks is like the,ep025
147,way to go,ep025
150,it's I'm really up here I know I really,ep025
153,like it's part of the city I love I feel,ep025
156,that Pittsburgh is the best city in the,ep025
159,world but one of the first conversations,ep025
162,we had Canton said to me he said you,ep025
165,realized history not really the best,ep025
168,city in the world right and I was like,ep025
171,no i think everyone from pittsburgh will,ep025
174,tell you it is very the best city in the,ep025
177,world if you have a ton of the city,ep025
180,pride and it all stems from the sports,ep025
183,teams it's perhaps home for us too I,ep025
186,mean we both grew up about an hour,ep025
189,outside of the city a great place to,ep025
192,start a family so they've decided to buy,ep025
195,their first home here and have set their,ep025
198,"budget at $600,000 mmediately then",ep025
201,obviously we have some different,ep025
204,architectural styles that we're working,ep025
207,through Kane is looking for shiny new,ep025
210,and really what I'm looking for is is,ep025
213,the fairy tale when I walk in the house,ep025
216,it has to have the right feel to me and,ep025
219,Maria gets that feeling from homes that,ep025
222,are close to a hundred years old I'm a,ep025
225,big bookworm and I see a house as a,ep025
228,setting for your story a thing I like,ep025
231,about old houses is that I feel that it,ep025
234,gives you a connection to the past and,ep025
237,you get to sort of share in someone,ep025
240,else's story and see how they live my,ep025
243,dream home is the whole Victorian,ep025
246,wraparound porch with the lattice,ep025
249,woodwork,ep025
252,she also likes the character of,ep025
255,tudor-style house they went too far with,ep025
258,the wood on this one oh that's original,ep025
261,hardwood I liked being to be newer newer,ep025
264,is always better I don't want to be in,ep025
267,someone else's history I want to start,ep025
270,my own I can't imagine myself buying,ep025
273,fixer-upper to fix up and in that sense,ep025
276,I'm thinking something modern what Kane,ep025
279,is looking for is something that used to,ep025
282,be a warehouse or a garage or some other,ep025
285,industrial place concrete floors with,ep025
288,just tech everywhere you I just can't do,ep025
291,it like no no I don't want to live in a,ep025
294,garage I just don't want to live in a,ep025
297,garage that is an unfair,ep025
300,characterization I want clean blinds I,ep025
303,don't want things to be cluttered I want,ep025
306,a house that's preserve the integrity,ep025
309,of the history and the time period,ep025
312,original hardwood I love the idea of,ep025
315,pocket doors big grand staircase,ep025
318,fireplace is a must and a closet bathtub,ep025
321,would be above and beyond my,ep025
324,expectations it doesn't have a small,ep025
327,partition rooms make the house feel,ep025
330,smaller I think people have this idea,ep025
333,that it makes it feel cozy people in the,ep025
336,kitchen need to be able to talk to,ep025
339,people in living room and everything he,ep025
342,said I just feel like back to the acid,ep025
345,about it I like the smaller rooms,ep025
348,good-looking bitchin nice kitchen an,ep025
351,updated kitchen is important for me I,ep025
354,spend a lot of time in the kitchen I,ep025
357,really enjoy cooking I would like,ep025
360,something with nice appliances I love,ep025
363,the idea of a breakfast bar jatin does,ep025
366,spend a lot of time in the kitchen,ep025
369,keeping me company,ep025
372,whenever I'm cooking this bedroom either,ep025
375,we absolutely mean ensuite bathroom in,ep025
378,the master bedroom it's just a much more,ep025
381,convenient especially if you have guests,ep025
384,over to have come so what I think about,ep025
387,your books are that there's always this,ep025
390,office a library for Maria's books and a,ep025
393,spacious backyard for entertaining round,ep025
396,out their list I do believe there is a,ep025
399,happy medium between what she's looking,ep025
402,for and without looking for okay,ep025
405,just like the setting to a Stephen King,ep025
408,novel more like a fairytale,ep025
411,I brought Caden and Maria to this,ep025
414,property specifically because it's a,ep025
417,Victorian home the character and the,ep025
420,charm throughout there's preserved,ep025
423,history in the home so this is more up,ep025
426,Maria's alley seller is asking 540 mm,ep025
429,budget yeah the coolest part is that,ep025
432,it's built in 1896 so I really think you,ep025
435,like that old teacher 119 years old I,ep025
438,know isn't it wonderful bunch of this,ep025
441,house was gonna range but with an older,ep025
444,house like this I know there's gonna be,ep025
447,a lot of renovations anyway a lot of,ep025
450,money that we probably don't want to,ep025
453,spend and love that stained glass that,ep025
456,is absolutely gorgeous this is a very,ep025
459,impressive entryway I will say that yeah,ep025
462,this is fantastic with all the original,ep025
465,woodwork can't get that and you nearly,ep025
468,built home oh and look at this fireplace,ep025
471,that is so neat there's actually six,ep025
474,original fireplaces throughout the home,ep025
477,that's awesome focal point want to walk,ep025
480,them right into the family room love,ep025
483,this detail on the ceiling notice so,ep025
486,needed this house is gonna be drafty and,ep025
489,then if you have a window this size it's,ep025
492,me really expensive to keep and cool,ep025
495,with insulation that's bad,ep025
498,well I mean we can upgrade that and we,ep025
501,find in it so we flow into the next room,ep025
504,the beautiful pocket doors it are,ep025
507,gorgeous I love the anything yeah with,ep025
510,those doors in the big entryway is they,ep025
513,it feels very open,ep025
516,it feels very open new your situation is,ep025
519,more when you're in the kitchen I'm in,ep025
522,here I won't be able to talk to you,ep025
525,while you're cooking yeah these light,ep025
528,fixtures are original and beautiful and,ep025
531,you can't get them anywhere else just,ep025
534,doesn't look good and that's a matter of,ep025
537,opinion honey I love this house because,ep025
540,it really takes me back to the time,ep025
543,period I think when she looks at this,ep025
546,house all he sees is old and he's,ep025
549,missing a lot of the character a lot of,ep025
552,the things you can't get in a newly,ep025
555,built house what do you think I don't,ep025
558,like it,ep025
561,this I don't even know I actually kind,ep025
564,of like this dome I think it's kind of,ep025
567,neat it's gonna be energy inefficient,ep025
570,it's clearly old I mean my biggest,ep025
573,problem with this kitchen is there's,ep025
576,just no storage or counter space,ep025
579,we'd have to totally got it they step,ep025
582,outside to see the yard it's a really,ep025
585,nice backyard space it's pretty private,ep025
588,yeah it's even being up so like play a,ep025
591,game of catch yeah you are planning,ep025
594,garden,ep025
597,they head back inside and upstairs to,ep025
600,see the bedrooms this is a very nice,ep025
603,room oh it's so beautiful this would be,ep025
606,a great library space it would be they,ep025
609,see another bedroom before looking at,ep025
612,the master yeah and it doesn't have an,ep025
615,attached bathroom which is that's like a,ep025
618,huge bummer there's a beautiful bathroom,ep025
621,down the hallway oh wow this is really,ep025
624,small it is and I love the clawfoot tub,ep025
627,it's absolutely beautiful but there's no,ep025
630,shower what I'm trying to get ready in,ep025
633,the morning it's gotta be a shower,ep025
636,yeah they look at one more bedroom,ep025
639,before heading to the third floor which,ep025
642,has been converted into an in-law suite,ep025
645,you don't usually see a kitchen on the,ep025
648,third floor yeah honestly this kitchen,ep025
651,is much better than the one downstairs,ep025
654,it's so much better than the one not,ep025
657,dated but I'm certainly not gonna serve,ep025
660,food on the third floor Yeah right let's,ep025
663,take a look at the second bedroom up,ep025
666,here on the third floor this is actually,ep025
669,really nice this is a really cool space,ep025
672,this is very cozy a little bedroom I,ep025
675,really like this room this could be like,ep025
678,a playroom or something like that to be,ep025
681,decided I feel like there's a lot of,ep025
684,potential in this home for you guys but,ep025
687,what are the both of you think the,ep025
690,historical elements are really preserved,ep025
693,in this house which is super important,ep025
696,to me and I love that honestly I think,ep025
699,the outdoor entertaining space is just,ep025
702,really spectacular I really like that,ep025
705,it's open concept between the living,ep025
708,room in the dining room but it still,ep025
711,shuts off the kitchen from the rest of,ep025
714,the house and then you know the master,ep025
717,bathroom is is just clearly too small,ep025
720,doesn't have a shower I really got to,ep025
723,see something a little more modern so,ep025
726,now they're seeing a brand new house for,ep025
729,chaitin's but Maria is not going down,ep025
732,without a fight,ep025
735,I'm,ep025
738,glad we're looking at a modern tone oh,ep025
741,yeah it's great if you want to live in a,ep025
744,parking garage,ep025
747,[Music],ep025
750,who's the prettiest city second,ep025
753,prettiest thing I've seen today as,ep025
756,excited as these Pittsburgh newlyweds,ep025
759,are to buy their first home they can't,ep025
762,agree on what they want Maria loves the,ep025
765,charm of a historical home the older the,ep025
768,better and Chetan is pushing for modern,ep025
771,"and new working with a budget of 600,000",ep025
774,Corian that had the character she likes,ep025
777,but it was too dated and lacked the open,ep025
780,feeling he's looking for,ep025
783,- please Chayton there Aidan has lined,ep025
786,up a brand-new single-family house I'm,ep025
789,so glad we're looking at a modern home,ep025
792,instead of another 100 year old pile of,ep025
795,kindling oh yeah it's great if you want,ep025
798,to live in a parking garage wow I really,ep025
801,like this entranceway,ep025
804,okay have a updated security system hey,ep025
807,guys hey good to see you,ep025
810,I figured you would love some of the,ep025
813,exterior features but wait till I show,ep025
816,you inside two bedrooms and three baths,ep025
819,but they're only asking for 79 nine,ep025
822,loves us in our budget it's great I'll,ep025
825,take a look inside yeah okay,ep025
828,[Music],ep025
831,this is literally like living in a,ep025
834,parking garage I'm gonna walk up these,ep025
837,stairs and think that my car is gonna be,ep025
840,right around the corner that's too dirty,ep025
843,you'd come home and see that this wall,ep025
846,shows that this house is strong and,ep025
849,well-built and let's talk about these,ep025
852,appliances this refrigerator uses less,ep025
855,energy it's better insulation than any,ep025
858,refrigerator on the entire market,ep025
861,whatever and is beautiful this marble,ep025
864,countertop is really really beautiful,ep025
867,though I do love that and all the,ep025
870,storage is really great yes no the,ep025
873,countertops are spectacular I sit in the,ep025
876,kitchen and talk to you while you're,ep025
879,making dinner or I can sit in the living,ep025
882,room and talk to you while you're making,ep025
885,dinner or you don't make dinner my,ep025
888,biggest problem with well this would,ep025
891,function nicely is a breakfast nook it's,ep025
894,not a formal dining room,ep025
897,I can't imagine hosing a Thanksgiving,ep025
900,dinner in a corner of my house ninety,ep025
903,nine so the meals that I eat are not,ep025
906,formal dinners all of the important,ep025
909,meals would be in a dining room every,ep025
912,meal is important it does kind of annoy,ep025
915,me when Maria says something like Oh,ep025
918,what about Christmas makes no sense at,ep025
921,all to rearrange your entire house the,ep025
924,entire home living for those three or,ep025
927,four days for the air I actually thought,ep025
930,you would really love this indoor gas,ep025
933,fireplace right in your family room so,ep025
936,there's going to be open flame,ep025
939,there is the horrors of this are frankly,ep025
942,beyond my own comprehension I don't find,ep025
945,this place very homey or warm to me it's,ep025
948,kind of sterile I think this place is,ep025
951,totally a bachelor pad I think this,ep025
954,would be a cool place for some dudes to,ep025
957,live but maybe not my family in the,ep025
960,future oh this is a matchbox oh come on,ep025
963,how big does your bedroom need to be,ep025
966,this is the guest verse is the guest,ep025
969,room,ep025
972,our guests are small people they'll be,ep025
975,fine no time I don't like the car,ep025
978,either I prefer hardwood it's an easy,ep025
981,fix they see a full bath before heading,ep025
984,to the master it's the master closet,ep025
987,this is a lot of wasted space in my,ep025
990,opinion zsa zsa gabor does not need this,ep025
993,much space for her stuff these closets,ep025
996,over here they door on them maybe okay,ep025
999,but this way you have to keep all of,ep025
1002,your clothes completely meticulously,ep025
1005,organized or it'll look sloppy and messy,ep025
1008,yeah you're right actually if we go over,ep025
1011,to the right we're into the master,ep025
1014,bedroom I really like this actually this,ep025
1017,is really really pretty I love all the,ep025
1020,natural light I really really love this,ep025
1023,patio this home doesn't really have a,ep025
1026,library for me but the back patio I,ep025
1029,really like to be outside reading and,ep025
1032,that's pretty perfect wow that bathtub,ep025
1035,is spectacular I really like the fact it,ep025
1038,was two sinks that we can both get ready,ep025
1041,in the morning in this shower over here,ep025
1044,is actually amazing yeah I love that,ep025
1047,rainfall showerhead,ep025
1050,they head upstairs to see the rooftop,ep025
1053,deck check out this outdoor space and,ep025
1056,not to mention the beautiful views oh,ep025
1059,wow that's beautiful oh my god what is,ep025
1062,happening over there,ep025
1065,no no not at all oh the view is amazing,ep025
1068,but this place is a little bit too,ep025
1071,unfinished to have guests up here uh,ep025
1074,yeah I totally agree they head,ep025
1077,downstairs and outside to the yard,ep025
1080,there's no like patio area anywhere we,ep025
1083,could kind of have like seating and,ep025
1086,grilling it's all kind of uneven yeah,ep025
1089,this is kind of a problem,ep025
1092,[Music],ep025
1095,what do you guys think of the place it's,ep025
1098,not really my style it's so pretty on,ep025
1101,the inside I just love how modern and,ep025
1104,open it is plus the name bathroom is so,ep025
1107,beautiful and also the main bedroom,ep025
1110,dated kitchen is a really big plus but,ep025
1113,the size is really a concern for me I,ep025
1116,don't think a kid could really grow up,ep025
1119,there now they're going to see a larger,ep025
1122,house that their agent hopes has the,ep025
1125,right mix of upgrades and character,ep025
1128,[Music],ep025
1131,newlyweds chaiten and Maria are hunting,ep025
1134,for their first house in Pittsburgh with,ep025
1137,"a budget of $600,000 armours and his",ep025
1140,preference for modern and new has been a,ep025
1143,challenge so far they've seen a spacious,ep025
1146,1896 Victorian ideal for Maria but too,ep025
1149,dated for Chase then they saw a,ep025
1152,brand-new house with the modern upgrades,ep025
1155,he wants but it was too sterile and,ep025
1158,small for her so now their agent has,ep025
1161,lined up a spacious house which she,ep025
1164,hopes has the modern updates chaiten,ep025
1167,wants and the character Maria likes the,ep025
1170,property has great curb appeal I really,ep025
1173,like the way the outside looked I love,ep025
1176,the brick but you know as an older house,ep025
1179,you know there's a lot more things that,ep025
1182,are gonna go wrong then with the modern,ep025
1185,house the listeners are asking 589 9,ep025
1188,morning guys oh boy I like this this is,ep025
1191,pretty in this family room Maria the,ep025
1194,details in the fireplace oh my god oh,ep025
1197,look at these windows aren't they,ep025
1200,awesome look how cool they are no no,ep025
1203,these storm windows outside you can't,ep025
1206,even open these weathers you want to you,ep025
1209,can take the storm windows no I,ep025
1212,that's not except the lighting is,ep025
1215,perfect we can't agree more,ep025
1218,okay let's go into the dining room what,ep025
1221,do you think the hard mode flex hardwood,ep025
1224,floors need to be redone,ep025
1227,no they're getting easily refinished,ep025
1230,them you're not gonna find these in a,ep025
1233,brand new home that's Jeff that's the,ep025
1236,problem they look like old floors and,ep025
1239,I'm not a person who likes to old floors,ep025
1242,in my house with this house being built,ep025
1245,in 1926 a lot of the original features,ep025
1248,have been preserved which I know that,ep025
1251,you'll love and it kind of has an,ep025
1254,updated field for you - Jayden hey I,ep025
1257,gotta say I really love this countertop,ep025
1260,so beautiful and this fireplace is,ep025
1263,absolutely awesome that is a very,ep025
1266,beautiful yeah future I have not seen a,ep025
1269,fireplace like that a kitchen so that's,ep025
1272,a really cool unique thing that I like I,ep025
1275,think one of the things you notice about,ep025
1278,this house is that the rooms are kind of,ep025
1281,cut up the kitchen doesn't talk to the,ep025
1284,living room which is not greater for,ep025
1287,chaiten it has a breakfast bar so even,ep025
1290,though it's not open-concept he can,ep025
1293,still be in the kitchen with me we can,ep025
1296,communicate well this is beautiful deck,ep025
1299,look at this unique feature there's a,ep025
1302,koi pond what do you think those are,ep025
1305,very pretty koi back inside they pass a,ep025
1308,powder room as they head upstairs oh my,ep025
1311,favorite,ep025
1314,Thanks would be imperfect libraries days,ep025
1317,yeah I mean with the built-ins and,ep025
1320,everything they look at another bedroom,ep025
1323,with an attached full bath before seeing,ep025
1326,the master Wow,ep025
1329,oh that's nice wow it looks brand-new,ep025
1332,upgrades this is modern closet this is,ep025
1335,beautiful now update bathroom I can,ep025
1338,totally get behind this bathroom is,ep025
1341,amazing the shower this is the showers,ep025
1344,as good as any shower to see the spot I,ep025
1347,love this floor this large beautiful and,ep025
1350,that vanity is really perfect it's so,ep025
1353,functional they head to the third floor,ep025
1356,to see the additional bedrooms Oh,ep025
1359,awesome nice place to put someone up,ep025
1362,here cuz bathroom time home yeah I like,ep025
1365,this belt downs over there those are,ep025
1368,cool yeah none of bonus from over here,ep025
1371,bedroom it's awesome oh I love that,ep025
1374,window that's beautiful what a great,ep025
1377,little room best of all right in this,ep025
1380,bathroom the wonderful tide take a fee,ep025
1383,wow you can take a bath or shower in,ep025
1386,there which is amazing it's so much I,ep025
1389,can't believe they stopped making it'll,ep025
1392,be a much better bath with the feet,ep025
1395,[Music],ep025
1398,Hospital we had a lot of hyphens for me,ep025
1401,it's got a lot of original features like,ep025
1404,the stained glass and the hardwood I,ep025
1407,think the front yard in the backyard are,ep025
1410,great places to have people over and,ep025
1413,hang out a suite bathroom is great it's,ep025
1416,not quite as open floor plan is I like,ep025
1419,that you know obviously you like the,ep025
1422,older homes but more into the modern,ep025
1425,model making a decision won't be easy in,ep025
1428,their battle between vintage and modern,ep025
1431,their choice may come down to an,ep025
1434,attached master bath an open-concept or,ep025
1437,a nice yard sign be down to brass tacks,ep025
1440,yeah we should traffic,ep025
1443,[Music],ep025
1446,Maria and Shaitan are looking for their,ep025
1449,first house in Pittsburgh,ep025
1452,"with a max budget of $600,000 they've",ep025
1455,seen several options and are ready to,ep025
1458,decide well why are talking about the,ep025
1461,Victorian that was listed at 5:42 but,ep025
1464,the problem really comes down to that,ep025
1467,kitchen I can't see you enjoying cooking,ep025
1470,in there but it has all of those really,ep025
1473,great historical features that I'm,ep025
1476,really excited about I think my biggest,ep025
1479,concern is actually the master bath you,ep025
1482,know it doesn't communicate with that,ep025
1485,master bedroom which is also a little,ep025
1488,bit small and a no shower,ep025
1491,obviously right that's a huge thing the,ep025
1494,outdoor space is great for entertaining,ep025
1497,though it is it's probably the biggest,ep025
1500,yard you know in any house in Pittsburgh,ep025
1503,we really got to start talking about,ep025
1506,that modern house for 479 there's so,ep025
1509,much love that there's a new new,ep025
1512,construction the openness of it the,ep025
1515,living room and the dining room being in,ep025
1518,the same room was the kitchen I really,ep025
1521,like that that's cuz you're like an open,ep025
1524,concept my kitchen was really nice new,ep025
1527,bright updated I love the countertops,ep025
1530,that granite was really beautiful talk,ep025
1533,about the master bathroom it's probably,ep025
1536,the nicest bathroom that I've seen since,ep025
1539,we've been looking at houses I mean it's,ep025
1542,nice because only two bedrooms and the,ep025
1545,lawn is smaller let's talk about the,ep025
1548,Tudor that was listed at 589 I like how,ep025
1551,the master bathrooms attached to the,ep025
1554,master bedroom has our outdoor,ep025
1557,entertaining space that we're looking,ep025
1560,for you can tell that they've added a,ep025
1563,ton of new office to it I think you,ep025
1566,still have the wow effect when you walk,ep025
1569,into that house because you have some,ep025
1572,stained glass which is nice and then,ep025
1575,that original fireplace that I really,ep025
1578,like but in reality it's not the open,ep025
1581,concept I think it made my decision yeah,ep025
1584,I think I'm pretty sure I know which one,ep025
1587,I want,ep025
1590,I think it's gonna have to be the tutor,ep025
1593,I mean it's just too good compromise for,ep025
1596,the both of us it has you know the,ep025
1599,updates that you're looking for it has,ep025
1602,the charm that I'm looking for it's got,ep025
1605,the outdoor entertaining space you ask,ep025
1608,me the tutor yeah I agree,ep025
1611,just the master bathroom and bedroom,ep025
1614,those two factors make it you know all,ep025
1617,the difference in the world so is it,ep025
1620,time to call Ashley I think you should,ep025
1623,okay good,ep025
1626,[Music],ep025
1629,these are for my mom okay beautiful oh,ep025
1632,they're really nice,ep025
1635,we've been here for three weeks we've,ep025
1638,got our little major stuff in but we're,ep025
1641,still decorating and getting some of the,ep025
1644,final touches done can't wait to drink,ep025
1647,out of those on New Year's Eve yeah,ep025
1650,the house was listed for five hundred,ep025
1653,and eighty nine thousand dollars and we,ep025
1656,ended up paying five hundred and twenty,ep025
1659,six thousand dollars the first thing we,ep025
1662,did was we wanted to paint the house to,ep025
1665,make it feel like our own so we kind of,ep025
1668,lightened it up everything but there was,ep025
1671,a lot of new things in here and I can,ep025
1674,see that the other things that we might,ep025
1677,want update later those will be easy,ep025
1680,enough to change the space is working,ep025
1683,out great for entertaining,ep025
1686,he's like so pretty I can't wait to eat,ep025
1689,them I love cooking in this space,ep025
1692,there's lots of countertops that I can,ep025
1695,kind of utilize you're sneaking one now,ep025
1698,it's been great cooking here my dad,ep025
1701,it's so nice to have a mitt in your,ep025
1704,backyard I love it we really do like the,ep025
1707,backyard koi pond is beautiful just,ep025
1710,really nice to have I finally got my,ep025
1713,library it's so wonderful and he let me,ep025
1716,paint it pink you help check out the,ep025
1719,paint colors I did from the moment I,ep025
1722,walked into this house I just felt like,ep025
1725,it had this great positive homey kind of,ep025
1728,vibe to it I think I compromised on a,ep025
1731,lot of things that I wanted but but I,ep025
1734,got in the end was the happy wife and,ep025
1737,that's the most important thing of all,ep025
1740,[Music],ep025
12,hi girls what would you like in a house,ep026
15,when Peters job in Alaska came to an end,ep026
18,I was in the oil and gas industry he got,ep026
21,the chance to move his wife and their,ep026
24,two daughters a world away to his native,ep026
27,Australia if we had to go somewhere I,ep026
30,was really excited about it being in,ep026
33,Perth looking forward to having more,ep026
36,time as the family but worried if we're,ep026
39,gonna make friends on up and while,ep026
42,Helens got her eye on a spacious home,ep026
45,close to the girls school oh love it,ep026
48,whoa Wow sole breadwinner Peter is,ep026
51,keeping tabs on the budgets coming at,ep026
54,six hundred and eighty thousand six,ep026
57,eighty yeah I can see this being an,ep026
60,awesome place for our family,ep026
63,[Music],ep026
66,beautiful it's so different even summer,ep026
69,in Alaska it just doesn't feel like this,ep026
72,kind of doesn't compare,ep026
75,we met in a church actually in London,ep026
78,when we did meet one of the things I,ep026
81,said to you Perth would be a great place,ep026
84,to live way back then didn't I you did,ep026
87,I've never been so I just had to believe,ep026
90,in and now we have girls what do you,ep026
93,think about living kind of close to the,ep026
96,beach we've been married for over 12,ep026
99,years now and two girls Naomi she's nine,ep026
102,and Lydia who seven we've got this,ep026
105,beautiful community around us in Alaska,ep026
108,so it's quite scary to move to a new,ep026
111,place I'm I'm an Aussie and I'm really,ep026
114,confident they're gonna make friends in,ep026
117,Alaska I was working in the oil and gas,ep026
120,industry and my role comes to an end we,ep026
123,didn't know what we were gonna do and,ep026
126,just knew that my life had suddenly been,ep026
129,turned upside down and then I ended up,ep026
132,getting a new job in Perth I was excited,ep026
135,sad to be leaving Alaska right now one,ep026
138,of the things we're looking forward to,ep026
141,in the move is to being able to spend,ep026
144,more time together,ep026
147,Pete was working some really long hours,ep026
150,and this new role we're gonna get to,ep026
153,spend some more time as a family,ep026
156,[Music],ep026
159,difficult one the stress levels have,ep026
162,definitely gone up haven't they we have,ep026
165,to make big decisions like where are we,ep026
168,gonna live and what about the girls,ep026
171,I've lived in Perth and it's a great,ep026
174,lifestyle everyone's out doing fun,ep026
177,things the oceans so close to anywhere,ep026
180,in Perth there's this bright feel to the,ep026
183,place and you see that in the people and,ep026
186,their lifestyle and even in the middle,ep026
189,of winter it's cold but once you've been,ep026
192,living in Alaska Perth cold really isn't,ep026
195,gonna be a problem it's a great,ep026
198,environment to bring our kids it's one,ep026
201,of the safest cities in the world it's,ep026
204,friendly and I think it's just a,ep026
207,magnificent place to call home so we're,ep026
210,looking for four bedrooms and two,ep026
213,bathrooms single storey,ep026
216,I much prefer two stories actually and a,ep026
219,pool,ep026
222,girls okay that is that's something we,ep026
225,agree on what else you guys looking for,ep026
228,pretty modern,ep026
231,Arthur UN's kitchens I'd like them to be,ep026
234,really modern so have you got any areas,ep026
237,that you've earmarked at all we have got,ep026
240,the girls in a great school in Harris,ep026
243,Dale and so I think somewhere between,ep026
246,Harris Dale and the city would be great,ep026
249,to keep my commute short okay for me I,ep026
252,really want to be really close to the,ep026
255,school ideally within walking distance,ep026
258,that would be great I would like to be,ep026
261,close to the work so my commutes not too,ep026
264,"far so what's your budget 650,000 is the",ep026
267,absolute limit sounds great the first,ep026
270,thing is that I picked up to be quite,ep026
273,honest with you is that what one wants,ep026
276,isn't necessarily very important to the,ep026
279,other person and within their budget,ep026
282,it's gonna be a tight stretch this home,ep026
285,has a pool which is what they were after,ep026
288,and also very close to the school which,ep026
291,was very very important for Helen but,ep026
294,commuting for Peter might be an issue,ep026
297,Helen and Peter I've got the perfect,ep026
300,property for you guys and Helen the,ep026
303,schools are meters away and I know,ep026
306,that's really important it's got four,ep026
309,bedrooms it's got three bathrooms it's,ep026
312,got the pool how much it's come in at,ep026
315,six hundred and eighty thousand six,ep026
318,eighty,ep026
321,oh my goodness our budget 650 that's,ep026
324,what we said that's really our limit you,ep026
327,could get any sort of house once you go,ep026
330,over your limit,ep026
333,please come on through if several living,ep026
336,areas this is the first one I really,ep026
339,like it,ep026
342,I really don't want that wallpaper we,ep026
345,can change it,ep026
348,I'm not convinced together Wow look at,ep026
351,that space there's so much room,ep026
354,it's snow this is really nice Terry it's,ep026
357,a really light area as well let's go,ep026
360,upstairs and have a look Oh,ep026
363,upstairs really and throughout my,ep026
366,childhood I was in a one-story house,ep026
369,it's just normal I think most Aussies,ep026
372,live in one storey houses we've got two,ep026
375,great sized bedrooms purple birds to,ep026
378,match the purple kind of house look this,ep026
381,is a nice room but kids ruins a kid's,ep026
384,room so yeah yeah this is a pretty good,ep026
387,space although else on the road we came,ep026
390,in on that's kind of right by the front,ep026
393,bedroom here and I'm just not on the,ep026
396,same page I think he needs to loosen up,ep026
399,a bit,ep026
402,the locations gonna be a harder one to,ep026
405,compromise on okay yeah oh wow it's,ep026
408,really modern they're not this is just,ep026
411,mirror these things really low,ep026
414,they are quite low on I mean if I was,ep026
417,gonna try and shave in here and get,ep026
420,right down yeah there might be something,ep026
423,we need to spend money on to renovate,ep026
426,and the price over our budget this is,ep026
429,just a beautiful area imagine the girls,ep026
432,what about me I'm gonna love the pool,ep026
435,it's really awesome well what do you,ep026
438,think but what about the city for work,ep026
441,what's my commute time gonna be you're,ep026
444,probably gonna look at 50 minutes 50,ep026
447,minutes yes that's a long time and the,ep026
450,other thing we've already talked about,ep026
453,is the price it's way over budget well,ep026
456,look at it you can see why I can't see,ep026
459,there's been an awesome place for our,ep026
462,family I just don't know,ep026
465,are we talking within our budget the,ep026
468,price comes down Peter this one's worth,ep026
471,six hundred and seventy thousand but not,ep026
474,quite enough for Peter to hear isn't,ep026
477,this beautiful when Peters job in Alaska,ep026
480,came to an end and he chose to move his,ep026
483,family to his native Australia,ep026
486,Ellen knew it would mean big changes for,ep026
489,her and her daughter's we had such an,ep026
492,amazing community in Alaska that people,ep026
495,were just incredible and that's what,ep026
498,fuels me is to have that community,ep026
501,around us for Peter it's a homecoming,ep026
504,but he's facing challenges of his own,ep026
507,I'm excited and nervous about moving to,ep026
510,Australia yeah excited because it is,ep026
513,back to a place that I know a place that,ep026
516,I love but I'm bidding nervous about the,ep026
519,job and bringing the girls up and that,ep026
522,Helen will get to live here so we'll see,ep026
525,how that goes so beautiful but with,ep026
528,Helen and the girls adjusting to a place,ep026
531,they've never been Peters needs are,ep026
534,taking a bit of a backseat on the house,ep026
537,side so what's my commute time gonna be,ep026
540,I would imagine maybe allow 50 minutes,ep026
543,50 minutes yes that's quite a long way,ep026
546,each way each day that's a lot of time,ep026
549,not being with the family Wow but Helen,ep026
552,is already finding things she likes,ep026
555,about Australia can you imagine the,ep026
558,girls love the girls what about me I can,ep026
561,see our family being really happy here,ep026
564,they can run around they can jump in the,ep026
567,pool they're gonna have a blast,ep026
570,"well budgets at 650,000 but I just think",ep026
573,for the right place it's worth,ep026
576,stretching in it although it's really,ep026
579,good,ep026
582,with house 2 Derrick tries to lower the,ep026
585,price,ep026
588,but that means compromising on location,ep026
591,the challenge with this one is the,ep026
594,commute for the kids,ep026
597,I don't know that Helens going to be,ep026
600,able to overcome the drive I'm taking,ep026
603,you guys to a suburb called janicot and,ep026
606,Peter you're concerned about commute I,ep026
609,think this one's going to be absolutely,ep026
612,perfect for you I'm more concerned about,ep026
615,the distance from the school it's only a,ep026
618,short 10-minute Drive it's a 4-bedroom,ep026
621,2-bathroom home how much are we talking,ep026
624,for this one six hundred and seventy,ep026
627,thousand Peter don't panic okay here we,ep026
630,are so let's get out and check it out,ep026
633,okay please going guys oh I love that on,ep026
636,that table yeah that's quite nice isn't,ep026
639,it oh this is quite knotless yeah this,ep026
642,is a decent size room you've got three,ep026
645,very similar bedrooms yeah that's good,ep026
648,fantastic well it's God stays to the,ep026
651,parents retreat Wow yeah this is not bad,ep026
654,how much space um there's no doors on,ep026
657,the bathroom that's not very private,ep026
660,this is big open space I like that,ep026
663,I think it's opulent oh it's a really,ep026
666,big bathroom though and look there's a,ep026
669,spa that's really nice very luxurious,ep026
672,yeah I love it this is a really nice on,ep026
675,sleep on suite without any doors that,ep026
678,doesn't make a good design him in my,ep026
681,eyes I think we need the privacy I don't,ep026
684,have any problem with that it's just you,ep026
687,and I in the room everything's fine,ep026
690,look at that view check it out this is,ep026
693,beautiful that's the main thing but,ep026
696,Derek no pool there's plenty of space to,ep026
699,put a pool in there beautiful view but,ep026
702,there was no pool so there's no way for,ep026
705,the price that we could afford this,ep026
708,house and put a pool in well that's more,ep026
711,of that view wow it's really nice and,ep026
714,open sure about these countertops,ep026
717,they're not marble it looks like,ep026
720,it's a funny shape isn't it look at this,ep026
723,beautiful open-plan living room I like,ep026
726,that and guys you've got a perfect,ep026
729,cinema room yep that's good I'll be able,ep026
732,to watch the cinema while you're cooking,ep026
735,a beautiful dinner peanuts really happy,ep026
738,with this place because it's much closer,ep026
741,to work he definitely liked the view and,ep026
744,a media room as well please go through,ep026
747,this is nice too comes right up to the,ep026
750,boundary though there's there's no,ep026
753,privacy in this is such a lovely area to,ep026
756,cook on or I can see us outside in,ep026
759,summer just enjoying this space this is,ep026
762,nice rain maybe we'd be inside even,ep026
765,though it's two stories I love that,ep026
768,master bedroom it's still worrying me,ep026
771,how far we are from school and there's,ep026
774,no pool that's true it's known for,ep026
777,missing the pool does it big negative,ep026
780,but being closer to my work think that,ep026
783,one is a really good compromise closer,ep026
786,to work we need a pool it's a little bit,ep026
789,high but I really like this house,ep026
792,Helen you're gonna love it,ep026
795,you guys are going to be able to walk,ep026
798,the kids to school and it's under budget,ep026
801,at six hundred and twenty thousand Peter,ep026
804,this could be a winner,ep026
807,[Music],ep026
810,I don't know they were gonna see any,ep026
813,penguins I think cuz it's winter they're,ep026
816,all nesting their burrows peter has,ep026
819,brought his wife and kids to his native,ep026
822,Australia after a big career change,ep026
825,prompted their move across the globe,ep026
828,Helen in the long run will be just fine,ep026
831,here and that's one of my jobs were,ep026
834,trying to help her see that by right now,ep026
837,she's really feeling nervous and she,ep026
840,also feels his great weight of,ep026
843,responsibility for the girls to actually,ep026
846,get them to feel comfortable,ep026
849,it's just mommies and daddies making,ep026
852,sure that little kids are okay moving to,ep026
855,a new house can be stressful adding and,ep026
858,moving to a new country as well it's,ep026
861,pretty stressful and we're budding heads,ep026
864,a little bit more than we normally do,ep026
867,Helen I don't really have a conflict,ep026
870,it's just that she doesn't see it my way,ep026
873,yet I love this house you know just it's,ep026
876,so modern and we've got all the,ep026
879,different living spaces for the kids you,ep026
882,know I can see there's been an awesome,ep026
885,place for our family,ep026
888,usually I really like it when Helens,ep026
891,happy that's excellent but in this case,ep026
894,she really liked an expensive house it's,ep026
897,way over budget 680 but look how close,ep026
900,it is to the school I can see that Peter,ep026
903,and I'm just not on the same page he's,ep026
906,very set on this budget and I think he,ep026
909,needs to loosen up a bit with that one,ep026
912,house two gets them closer to the budget,ep026
915,and much closer to Peters work I really,ep026
918,like this house I like the location I,ep026
921,think you'd find community here and I'm,ep026
924,close enough to work that I'd be able to,ep026
927,be around with us but I find it really,ep026
930,hard to go over our budget but Helen,ep026
933,wasn't as thrilled with what she saw in,ep026
936,the home there's no doors on the,ep026
939,bathroom and that's not very private and,ep026
942,that's no pool we need a pool all right,ep026
945,this property's close to the school with,ep026
948,two living areas and a pool and most,ep026
951,importantly it's under budget,ep026
954,yippee capito I've got the perfect,ep026
957,property for you guys it's four bedroom,ep026
960,two bathroom it's got that pool that you,ep026
963,guys are after service bro that sounds,ep026
966,good you guys are gonna be able to walk,ep026
969,the kids to school,ep026
972,that's brilliant and Peter it's under,ep026
975,budget as well at six hundred and twenty,ep026
978,thousand fantastic this is it guys this,ep026
981,is one story Derek looks fantastic Derek,ep026
984,really plays one story excellent,ep026
987,come on through guys that's the master,ep026
990,retreat it's so light it is just an,ep026
993,awesome big problem with one story honey,ep026
996,Aimee walking past is looking right in,ep026
999,at us I mean it's a quiet street I,ep026
1002,haven't seen anybody go past I think,ep026
1005,it's gonna be just fine,ep026
1008,and I really like the ensuite got a spa,ep026
1011,it's got the two sinks I quite like it,ep026
1014,it's okay let's go and take a look at,ep026
1017,the rest of the home how's this for a,ep026
1020,grand kitchen I really like the island,ep026
1023,bench yeah cuz here me working here when,ep026
1026,we can still see what's going out in the,ep026
1029,living room for guests and cute natural,ep026
1032,light coming in though I can see that it,ep026
1035,ticks a lot of boxes for Pete this house,ep026
1038,but for the rest of the family I feel,ep026
1041,like we're gonna be living on top of,ep026
1044,each other when we're all in this one,ep026
1047,level oh I think this could work,ep026
1050,this isn't too bad it feels small I feel,ep026
1053,cramped in here these are great sized,ep026
1056,bedrooms and you've got three of them,ep026
1059,and it's also got a built-in wardrobe,ep026
1062,this would be just fine for the kids,ep026
1065,I just wish with these bedrooms were,ep026
1068,upstairs oh this is cool look at these,ep026
1071,fans,ep026
1074,that's very cool how's that for a,ep026
1077,barbecue yeah lovely a whole outdoor,ep026
1080,outdoor kitchen barbecue yeah very,ep026
1083,Australian and the full look at that,ep026
1086,pool,ep026
1089,lovely handful that's heated as well,ep026
1092,guys I hate it absolutely why that's no,ep026
1095,backyard oh there's no place for me to,ep026
1098,run around unfortunately having the pool,ep026
1101,there you do lose out on a bit of,ep026
1104,backyard oh okay,ep026
1107,oh but overall this is great isn't it,ep026
1110,this is a really nice it's slightly far,ep026
1113,away from my work but it's got,ep026
1116,everything it's under budget,ep026
1119,it's got the pool modern house this has,ep026
1122,got a lot going for it I do like how,ep026
1125,close it is to school but I don't know I,ep026
1128,don't want to fight with Pete but I also,ep026
1131,know will work best for our family I'd,ep026
1134,like to be able to make the decision,ep026
1137,together but right now I'm just feeling,ep026
1140,like we're not in the same place,ep026
1143,[Music],ep026
1146,I'm feeling really anxious,ep026
1149,come all this way from the US car and,ep026
1152,put a get this house right after we've,ep026
1155,lived for a number of years in Alaska my,ep026
1158,job came to an end though and being an,ep026
1161,Aussie I thought let's go back to,ep026
1164,Australia where the girls school are,ep026
1167,because that's who I'm gonna meet the,ep026
1170,Friends of the girls and their parents,ep026
1173,moving to a new house can be stressful,ep026
1176,adding and moving to a new country as,ep026
1179,well it's pretty stressful but with,ep026
1182,Peter being a stickler for the budget,ep026
1185,helen is concerned that she and the,ep026
1188,girls won't get a spacious home with a,ep026
1191,pool why don't we talk about that real,ep026
1194,expensive one first a great location I,ep026
1197,love that place can you imagine the,ep026
1200,girls love girls what about me I,ep026
1203,couldn't see this being an awesome place,ep026
1206,for our family it was a little bit far,ep026
1209,from work and it was too expensive it's,ep026
1212,coming at six hundred and eighty,ep026
1215,thousand 680 and it was two stories,ep026
1218,usually I really like it when Helens,ep026
1221,happy that's excellent but in this case,ep026
1224,do you really like an expensive house,ep026
1227,that was close to work for you so that,ep026
1230,was good I like the location I think,ep026
1233,you'd find community here and I'm close,ep026
1236,enough to work that I'd be able to be,ep026
1239,around with us that's what he was hoping,ep026
1242,for it was over budget again but he was,ep026
1245,willing to compromise on the budget for,ep026
1248,this one because of the location but,ep026
1251,having the two storeys meant we had that,ep026
1254,great parent retreat that says wow yeah,ep026
1257,this is not bad so much space,ep026
1260,and look at that view how about the,ep026
1263,single story,ep026
1266,this is one story Derek looks fantastic,ep026
1269,Derek one story excellent that was only,ep026
1272,six hundred and twenty thousand well,ep026
1275,within our budget,ep026
1278,and I had a pool have much natural,ep026
1281,sunlight and there was no player outside,ep026
1284,for the kids I can see us out here with,ep026
1287,the girls in the pool we just sit here,ep026
1290,very awesome,ep026
1293,he was really happy at this place it was,ep026
1296,close to the school so maybe I can,ep026
1299,compromise,ep026
1302,[Music],ep026
1305,look I think we need to rule one out,ep026
1308,okay the one thing on our wish list that,ep026
1311,we've all agreed on even the girls is,ep026
1314,that we really want a pool so you think,ep026
1317,the one we are up or we could rule that,ep026
1320,out,ep026
1323,I think we should rule that one out so,ep026
1326,I'd have to compromise on location yeah,ep026
1329,and that means we'll definitely get a,ep026
1332,pool yeah,ep026
1335,I really like the single story I think,ep026
1338,there's got no stairs it's great price,ep026
1341,and it's got everything we want well,ep026
1344,you've got to remember you also really,ep026
1347,like the big backyard in that two-story,ep026
1350,place and that the room for us to grow,ep026
1353,as a family we've already compromised,ep026
1356,for your location and we'll get the,ep026
1359,right budget it's got the pool I think,ep026
1362,that's the one yes but it didn't have a,ep026
1365,very big backyard to it because it was a,ep026
1368,single-story it took up the whole plot,ep026
1371,area I just can't see our family living,ep026
1374,there we're here in Australia we've got,ep026
1377,beautiful summers we want this outdoor,ep026
1380,lifestyle I think we need the place with,ep026
1383,the big pool and the big backyard grass,ep026
1386,area for the kids,ep026
1389,true but the one-story home has the,ep026
1392,right price we can stretch the budget,ep026
1395,for the right home and this is the right,ep026
1398,home it is a really nice big backyard,ep026
1401,it's got the beautiful pool on the kids,ep026
1404,to enjoy it and I want you to be happy I,ep026
1407,think we've made a decision,ep026
1410,this is definitely the right place for,ep026
1413,us and for our family it's so good being,ep026
1416,close to the school it's just a quick,ep026
1419,five minute walk it just makes it so,ep026
1422,much easier I really like standing here,ep026
1425,looking out at the pool and then some of,ep026
1428,the kids will be able to play out there,ep026
1431,and fantastic and the amazing thing is,ep026
1434,that I've actually left the job in the,ep026
1437,city and I've got a fantastic job at the,ep026
1440,school that we're at so I'm so glad you,ep026
1443,convinced me about the location I was,ep026
1446,right how does it feel to be back in,ep026
1449,there good yeah it's at least 20 years I,ep026
1452,think since our lives since we've been,ep026
1455,moved in that girls made some great,ep026
1458,friends at school we're really starting,ep026
1461,to make some close friendships yeah it's,ep026
1464,feeling like a home and it's really nice,ep026
1467,we have people around we can all just,ep026
1470,sit in that beautiful open living space,ep026
1473,together there's a good place for us,ep026
1476,love is happy to life and Perth is,ep026
1479,perfect beautiful weather beautiful,ep026
1482,friends going well,ep026
1485,you,ep026
12,this is exactly why I wanted me to San,ep027
15,Clemente is to get something like this,ep027
18,David loves the beach lifestyle in,ep027
21,Southern California I want to show you,ep027
24,the most beachy part of this property,ep027
27,all right the outdoor shower nice he,ep027
30,wants to buy a house walking distance to,ep027
33,the ocean three blocks from the beach it,ep027
36,doesn't get much better than that yeah,ep027
39,only issue to get the prime location he,ep027
42,wants will mean making serious,ep027
45,compromises on condition and size two,ep027
48,bedrooms one bath 883 square feet 883,ep027
51,that's tiny we're at the beach that is,ep027
54,the washer and dryer in the kitchen it's,ep027
57,a smaller home and it's an efficient use,ep027
60,of space it is popular in Europe I guess,ep027
63,I was hoping for more of an American,ep027
66,kitchen,ep027
69,[Music],ep027
72,I think she check this place out okay,ep027
75,I'm David I'm 36 I work in product,ep027
78,marketing for a home technology company,ep027
81,about a year ago I moved from LA to,ep027
84,Carlsbad in North San Diego County and I,ep027
87,love it,ep027
90,but I find that every weekend I'm,ep027
93,driving north to Orange County to see my,ep027
96,family and friends,ep027
99,I can't wait to not have to drive an,ep027
102,hour ago yeah exactly,ep027
105,we can do this every night Orange County,ep027
108,for me is home and I love so many things,ep027
111,about it the beaches are you know,ep027
114,unparalleled if I really enjoy kayaking,ep027
117,hiking along the beach going for a swim,ep027
120,the Orange County town of San Clemente,ep027
123,appeals to him in particular Saint,ep027
126,company is a little bit more of a sleepy,ep027
129,beach town but I love it because it just,ep027
132,gives it a little bit slower pace of,ep027
135,life has all the beauty of being close,ep027
138,to the coast without all the,ep027
141,overdevelopment at this point I'm tired,ep027
144,of renting I'm ready to put down some,ep027
147,roots and finally buy my own place you,ep027
150,guys think what's the poverty stuff I've,ep027
153,definitely was look at this man geez I,ep027
156,got the pier right here you got the,ep027
159,beach within walking distance if you,ep027
162,want to be on the west side yeah so,ep027
165,Trevor is helping me with my search we,ep027
168,met through a mutual friend at church,ep027
171,and became fast friends and he's a great,ep027
174,real estate agent so I think we can find,ep027
177,a great house hopefully and have a good,ep027
180,time doing it this benefited I know Dave,ep027
183,I can see a home and if I like it,ep027
186,there's a good chance Gabe's gonna like,ep027
189,it how much for one of these go for,ep027
192,Trevor it makes that happen got 10 mil I,ep027
195,might be a little outside of my price,ep027
198,range,ep027
201,yeah check yourself okay my budget is,ep027
204,750 thousand and that should include any,ep027
207,renovations that I need to do to the,ep027
210,home I liked those beach bungalows that,ep027
213,you see a lot around here insect money,ep027
216,yeah those are pretty cool I also like,ep027
219,the farmhouse look yeah like a coastal,ep027
222,farmhouse though kind of rustic oh yeah,ep027
225,rustic exposed wood beams there tends to,ep027
228,be some times these tract homes that,ep027
231,look like they're just stamped out and I,ep027
234,prefer not to go that cookie cutter,ep027
237,approach,ep027
240,he's a fan of hardwood floors,ep027
243,wainscoting and exposed brick as for,ep027
246,location I really want to be west of the,ep027
249,five walking distance to the beach if,ep027
252,possible how important is it that you're,ep027
255,walking distance to the beach I mean,ep027
258,that's pretty important that's part of,ep027
261,the reason why I'm moving to San,ep027
264,Clemente right it's a beach town you,ep027
267,know I want to be as close to the water,ep027
270,as possible I love the idea of living,ep027
273,close to the water being able to come,ep027
276,home on a Friday park my car in the,ep027
279,garage and then just not touch it all,ep027
282,weekend because everything I need is,ep027
285,right there I can pick you to walk to,ep027
288,the beach take my beach cruiser out and,ep027
291,go to meet my friends at restaurants,ep027
294,somewhere I know Dave really wants to be,ep027
297,west of the five and if I could just get,ep027
300,him East just a little bit east to the,ep027
303,same price you get so much more sickled,ep027
306,many slopes up as you get east of five,ep027
309,and so you're gonna get way more ocean,ep027
312,views the further away you get from the,ep027
315,water I realized that my budgets not,ep027
318,gonna give me everything I want but if,ep027
321,we can get 90% of the way there I think,ep027
324,I'll be more than happy in my new home I,ep027
327,definitely want a minimum of two,ep027
330,bedrooms two bathrooms I also really,ep027
333,want an outdoor entertaining space so I,ep027
336,could have my friends over and barbecue,ep027
339,entertain some things that I definitely,ep027
342,want to avoid would be an HOA if I can,ep027
345,and then if it's if it needs too much,ep027
348,work I would definitely prefer,ep027
351,move-in-ready the thing I'm looking,ep027
354,forward to most about having my own,ep027
357,place in San Clemente is just getting,ep027
360,all my friends together for a big,ep027
363,barbecue in the backyard being able to,ep027
366,finally entertain in my own place for me,ep027
369,right now in my stage of life I think it,ep027
372,makes a lot of sense to be close to the,ep027
375,water walk right to the beach that's,ep027
378,kind of my priority right now are you,ep027
381,gonna shred dinar or observe from afar,ep027
384,these are important questions,ep027
387,today Trevor is showing David a house,ep027
390,that's west of the five freeway and just,ep027
393,blocks from the beach you're literally,ep027
396,walking distance to all the shops and,ep027
399,restaurants down here nice this is the,ep027
402,lifestyle this is the beach very cool,ep027
405,and this is the house this is the house,ep027
408,it definitely has that beach bungalow,ep027
411,look that I was looking for the house,ep027
414,itself is two bedrooms one bath 883,ep027
417,square feet,ep027
420,they're asking seven hundred nineteen,ep027
423,thousand eight hundred eighty three,ep027
426,that's tiny we're at the beach yeah I,ep027
429,guess yeah I guess it is the beach but,ep027
432,it only has one bath I really wanted to,ep027
435,I think it's a rude awakening for Dave,ep027
438,it's not what everybody thinks that much,ep027
441,money could get but the reality is here,ep027
444,at the beach this is what you get so I,ep027
447,think given the budget that Dave is set,ep027
450,for me it's gonna be a lot of,ep027
453,compromises on his end Wow nice yeah I,ep027
456,definitely need some updating I think,ep027
459,but the room is kind of good-sized good,ep027
462,layout this carpet though would really,ep027
465,have to go I think I'd want to put in,ep027
468,wood floors probably sure and maybe we,ep027
471,could even continue this wood floor from,ep027
474,the kitchen so yeah I really do like,ep027
477,these floors so these are original of,ep027
480,the house you think yeah I think so yeah,ep027
483,it's got they got a lot of character I,ep027
486,like them I like the brick backsplash,ep027
489,and walls that's pretty cool too yeah it,ep027
492,goes with the rustic charm of the house,ep027
495,yeah,ep027
498,the countertops though are looking a,ep027
501,little dated I think I'd probably want,ep027
504,her place does yeah we could get a nice,ep027
507,granite in here pretty easily and I love,ep027
510,these beams on the ceiling yeah it's,ep027
513,really cool you know it's not a huge,ep027
516,kitchen but for me it would probably,ep027
519,work fine I mean it's a great kitchen,ep027
522,for the size of the home very functional,ep027
525,cool ah so this is the one and only,ep027
528,bathroom on one and only bathroom your,ep027
531,master your guest your powder room,ep027
534,everything all right here those showers,ep027
537,pretty nice I like the jetted tub and,ep027
540,it's got the wainscoting so it's got,ep027
543,that Beach coastal flair to it that is,ep027
546,cool and I like the wood floors too yeah,ep027
549,they're cool wood floors all right I,ep027
552,mean I definitely like to have two,ep027
555,bathrooms but this is actually a pretty,ep027
558,good-size bathroom so we're having one,ep027
561,bathroom this is pretty nice yeah David,ep027
564,sees a second bedroom that could be used,ep027
567,as an office space before heading to the,ep027
570,master bedroom all right very cool I,ep027
573,think it's pretty good-sized and I like,ep027
576,the fact that it's got the big sliding,ep027
579,doors to lead out to the patio yeah for,ep027
582,sure,ep027
585,and I'm noticing this,ep027
588,window this is a little bay window they,ep027
591,put in here it's not cool interesting,ep027
594,funky little touch yeah I think overall,ep027
597,it's a good room yeah the one thing to,ep027
600,notice though is if your guests you want,ep027
603,to go to the back yard from the house,ep027
606,they will be passing through your master,ep027
609,bed yeah that's not ideal wow this is I,ep027
612,have to say this is bigger than I was,ep027
615,expecting for a beach property a normal,ep027
618,of each properties don't have yards this,ep027
621,big and this is definitely an exception,ep027
624,so it's cool to have absolutely and it's,ep027
627,really private with these the trees,ep027
630,around the edge it's yeah it's nice I,ep027
633,want to show you the most beachy part of,ep027
636,this property alright and that's the,ep027
639,outdoor shower,ep027
642,nice yeah you gotta have an outdoor,ep027
645,shower if you have three blocks from the,ep027
648,beach it's pretty much required by code,ep027
651,yeah,ep027
654,finishing off the backyard is a casita,ep027
657,the guest house casita is super cool I,ep027
660,like the fact that it converted the,ep027
663,garage and it provides an extra square,ep027
666,footage that I could use for a guest,ep027
669,room so I think it's a really nice,ep027
672,feature yeah,ep027
675,I'd stay here very cool yeah you have to,ep027
678,use outside shower though yeah we'll,ep027
681,talk about that,ep027
684,[Music],ep027
687,there's a lot to like here I think,ep027
690,number one the location is awesome three,ep027
693,blocks from the beach it doesn't get,ep027
696,much better than that yeah it's great,ep027
699,and it's got really good outdoor,ep027
702,entertaining space that feels really,ep027
705,private and I know that's hard to find,ep027
708,this close to the water yeah so this,ep027
711,actually hits a lot of good points for,ep027
714,me on the downside this place is tiny,ep027
717,and it only has the one bathroom it's,ep027
720,definitely not turnkey if we can find,ep027
723,something a little bit bigger that would,ep027
726,be awesome,ep027
729,next up Trevor is taking David to see a,ep027
732,bigger and less expensive place but if,ep027
735,it sounds too good to be true I can,ep027
738,really hear that freeway noise,ep027
741,[Music],ep027
744,anyone go check out the pier yeah,ep027
747,alright wish it was just a little,ep027
750,sunnier out today yeah let's get coffee,ep027
753,whether it is cherish cheers to that,ep027
756,David is looking for a home in the,ep027
759,Oceanside town of San Clemente,ep027
762,California I've been saving for a long,ep027
765,time for my first home and now my lease,ep027
768,is almost up and I just feel like now is,ep027
771,the right time to start looking for my,ep027
774,"own home with a budget of 750,000",ep027
777,dollars he wants to live close to the,ep027
780,beach and it's vibrant community of,ep027
783,shops and restaurants specifically west,ep027
786,of the five freeway so far David has,ep027
789,seen a bungalow that's walking distance,ep027
792,to the beach but it's smaller than he,ep027
795,anticipated and it needs some more today,ep027
798,Trevor is taking David to another,ep027
801,bungalow that's a little farther from,ep027
804,the beach but it's bigger and less,ep027
807,expensive Trevor this is a cool beachy,ep027
810,neighborhood but I'm noticing the,ep027
813,freeway is literally right here yes we,ep027
816,are very close to the freeway and east,ep027
819,of the freeway right just barely what,ep027
822,did we say about that but the house is a,ep027
825,bargain because of it it's factored into,ep027
828,the price it's six hundred and seventy,ep027
831,thousand dollars I do like that that's,ep027
834,well under budget you're still walking,ep027
837,distance to the bars and restaurants and,ep027
840,it's totally the style you want yeah it,ep027
843,is that cool beach bungalow style that I,ep027
846,like it's a 2-bedroom 1-bath oh man I,ep027
849,wanted two bathrooms I know better,ep027
852,David like many first-time homebuyers,ep027
855,has a long list of things that he really,ep027
858,wants but there does need to be some,ep027
861,compromise because we are working with,ep027
864,the budget all right Wow yeah nice huh,ep027
867,pleasantly surprised I really like the,ep027
870,wood beam ceiling definitely kind of the,ep027
873,style that I like this kind of farmhouse,ep027
876,vibe,ep027
879,barn doors cool yeah it's really cool,ep027
882,this has a nice built in eating area,ep027
885,it's kind of cool makes good use of the,ep027
888,space mm-hmm we have a nice neutral tile,ep027
891,floor I do like wood tile yeah that's a,ep027
894,cool feature I like the finishes but the,ep027
897,kitchen layout is kind of weird with,ep027
900,like that the washer and dryer in here,ep027
903,you can cook your breakfast and clean,ep027
906,your underwear at the same time it's a,ep027
909,smaller home and it's an efficient use,ep027
912,of space it was popular in Europe okay I,ep027
915,guess I was hoping for more of an,ep027
918,American kitchen then Trevor shows Dave,ep027
921,a second bedroom that could be used as,ep027
924,an office,ep027
927,a guest bedroom before heading to the,ep027
930,only bathroom this is pretty small for,ep027
933,being the only bathroom in the house,ep027
936,beach homes near price point are gonna,ep027
939,be smaller in the bathrooms are gonna,ep027
942,reflect the size of the home all right I,ep027
945,mean it's definitely a negative so this,ep027
948,used to be the other bedroom and it,ep027
951,looks like they did an add-on to push it,ep027
954,out towards the back yard okay you know,ep027
957,it could be a good office they're using,ep027
960,it as a sitting room through here is the,ep027
963,sleeping area okay it'd be good for a,ep027
966,master you know mm-hmm it's a place to,ep027
969,sleep you know about it so right can't,ep027
972,jump on the bed this is the closet here,ep027
975,that's the closet all right,ep027
978,not a ton of room I'd want probably want,ep027
981,to put doors on there too mm-hmm and I,ep027
984,see it opens out to the patio it does so,ep027
987,here is the patio wow this I really like,ep027
990,this is awesome but you know what one,ep027
993,thing I'm still hearing that freeway,ep027
996,that freeways still there maybe you just,ep027
999,pretend that's the ocean here in,ep027
1002,Southern California we do have a lot of,ep027
1005,road noise freeways that sort of thing,ep027
1008,so a few tips and tricks for hiding that,ep027
1011,noise our fountains dual and triple pane,ep027
1014,windows great installation inside the,ep027
1017,walls if you can do those things he,ep027
1020,could get a great house for a great,ep027
1023,price and he'll really enjoy living here,ep027
1026,it really gives you an extra living area,ep027
1029,that you otherwise wouldn't have totally,ep027
1032,you get that whole indoor/outdoor flow,ep027
1035,yeah the outdoor living space here is,ep027
1038,fantastic the roofline also lends itself,ep027
1041,to a rooftop deck it is a possibility,ep027
1044,and especially with the price where it,ep027
1047,is at least some extra room to do things,ep027
1050,like sure yeah this is a really big,ep027
1053,selling feature having this outdoor,ep027
1056,entertaining space that's high on my,ep027
1059,list cool I mean this is a great option,ep027
1062,you know I feel like the inside is,ep027
1065,pretty turnkey you know they I like to,ep027
1068,style the house and I love that outdoor,ep027
1071,entertaining space easy access to the 5,ep027
1074,but I'm yeah that's that's one of the,ep027
1077,downsides I mean vary a little bit too,ep027
1080,easy access to the 5 I don't know if I,ep027
1083,can get past that freeway noise mm-hmm,ep027
1086,the kitchens really narrow,ep027
1089,and there's only one bathroom keep this,ep027
1092,place in mind because it does represent,ep027
1095,a really good value being this close to,ep027
1098,the ocean and this close to restaurants,ep027
1101,and shops well I really like this house,ep027
1104,I think I want to see something a little,ep027
1107,bit bigger and a little bit further from,ep027
1110,the freeway to meet David's wishes,ep027
1113,Trevor has lined up a quieter option,ep027
1116,away from the freeway Trevor where you,ep027
1119,taking me man this looks a little bit,ep027
1122,like suburbia where's the beach my own,ep027
1125,hat that way I know we're just east of,ep027
1128,five but it's a great neighborhood,ep027
1131,[Music],ep027
1134,just got to pick that line drop it it go,ep027
1137,David is looking for a home in San,ep027
1140,Clemente California armed with a budget,ep027
1143,"of 750,000 dollars he wants to put down",ep027
1146,roots near his friends and family while,ep027
1149,enjoying the beach lifestyle so far,ep027
1152,David loved the first home's proximity,ep027
1155,to the beach but was concerned about its,ep027
1158,small size and large price the bungalow,ep027
1161,just east of the five freeway was,ep027
1164,turnkey and well priced but the,ep027
1167,persistent roar of the freeway might be,ep027
1170,too much for him to live with so nice,ep027
1173,neighborhood Trevor but looks a little,ep027
1176,suburbia ish yeah I know we're just east,ep027
1179,of five but it's a great neighborhood,ep027
1182,dude you know I want to be what's the,ep027
1185,five I know but look at the house a,ep027
1188,three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath just,ep027
1191,"under 1,400 square feet and seven",ep027
1194,hundred ten thousand okay all right so,ep027
1197,it's within your range I like the style,ep027
1200,of it it's got the wood siding yeah we,ep027
1203,could roll with that nice it does have,ep027
1206,an HOA oh but it does cover your front,ep027
1209,yard maintenance your exterior,ep027
1212,maintenance and your roof all right,ep027
1215,[Music],ep027
1218,Wow I like how light and bright it is in,ep027
1221,here yeah,ep027
1224,nice lots of Windows yeah I love the,ep027
1227,windows looking out to the patio makes,ep027
1230,the whole room feel bigger and lots of,ep027
1233,nice natural light cellars just had it,ep027
1236,painted to freshen up a little bit cuz,ep027
1239,it's been on the market for a while yeah,ep027
1242,I like the blue wall the colors actually,ep027
1245,work for me before I'm not a fan of I,ep027
1248,seems like there's a lot of tile in here,ep027
1251,and you know I was hoping for wood,ep027
1254,ideally it's great for living by the,ep027
1257,beach because you can have sandy feet on,ep027
1260,it it's easy to clean up okay,ep027
1263,alright this does dining dining area yes,ep027
1266,would be your dining area seems like a,ep027
1269,fit my table pretty well this ceiling,ep027
1272,fans in a weird place though yeah we,ep027
1275,could get an electrician to move that,ep027
1278,over depending on where you'll slowly,ep027
1281,want your dining room table let's take a,ep027
1284,look at the backyard Wow now this is,ep027
1287,what I'm talking about this is great I,ep027
1290,love the privacy back here I love the,ep027
1293,patio the patio really seems like a,ep027
1296,great entertaining space I could really,ep027
1299,see myself out here with my friends my,ep027
1302,family seems like a great great part of,ep027
1305,the house back inside they see the,ep027
1308,kitchen I don't even think I could fit,ep027
1311,all my dishes and pots and pans in here,ep027
1314,let me think,ep027
1317,both of us can fit in here barely I mean,ep027
1320,I can literally touch both sides of the,ep027
1323,kitchen at once you can stand in one,ep027
1326,place you cook your entire meal that's a,ep027
1329,benefit I guess not one of the ones on,ep027
1332,my list but yeah I'll be honest like,ep027
1335,this small kitchen is definitely a big,ep027
1338,strike against this house David sees a,ep027
1341,half bath off of the kitchen before,ep027
1344,heading upstairs to see the first,ep027
1347,bedroom can we talk about the carpet,ep027
1350,because this looks pretty trashed this,ep027
1353,dollars were aware of it cuz they just,ep027
1356,have the home painted and they're,ep027
1359,willing to offer you a flooring credit,ep027
1362,towards new flooring okay it's another,ep027
1365,thing to do you'll really like this,ep027
1368,let's take a look outside,ep027
1371,oh wow check this out is a nice deck and,ep027
1374,an ocean view Wow cool this is exactly,ep027
1377,why I wanted to move to San Clemente is,ep027
1380,to get something like this that was a,ep027
1383,little skeptical being east of the five,ep027
1386,but this is definitely one in the plus,ep027
1389,column yeah it's nice cuz you know West,ep027
1392,of five but we couldn't get such a,ep027
1395,sunset ocean view for your price point,ep027
1398,yeah that's awesome,ep027
1401,lots of good outdoor entertaining space,ep027
1404,yeah Trevor shows David the second,ep027
1407,bedroom and bathroom on the wave of the,ep027
1410,master suite ocean view from the master,ep027
1413,yep we got to the ocean every morning I,ep027
1416,like that check out the bathroom,ep027
1419,nice big dual vanity then through here,ep027
1422,we have a soaking tub okay and the water,ep027
1425,closet it's nice to have the big master,ep027
1428,bath it's definitely a little dated but,ep027
1431,it works I'm pretty impressed I was a,ep027
1434,little skeptical at first with the,ep027
1437,location but I gotta say I love the view,ep027
1440,I like the floor plan overall I love the,ep027
1443,privacy of the patio I don't like that,ep027
1446,it's east of the five you know that so a,ep027
1449,little bit farther from the beach than I,ep027
1452,wanted to it's got an HOA which I,ep027
1455,definitely didn't want and that kitchen,ep027
1458,is tiny if I could pick this house up,ep027
1461,and put it right next to the water it'd,ep027
1464,be a no-brainer I'd be done but it's on,ep027
1467,the other side of the five I really have,ep027
1470,to think about this none of the homes,ep027
1473,has everything David wants in his first,ep027
1476,home so he'll have to decide what he's,ep027
1479,willing to sacrifice his dream of living,ep027
1482,close to the beach having two bathrooms,ep027
1485,or buying a turnkey home today what do,ep027
1488,you think what are you gonna do,ep027
1491,[Music],ep027
1494,David's looking for his first home in,ep027
1497,San Clemente California and his friend,ep027
1500,and real-estate agents Trevor has shown,ep027
1503,him several options near the beach and,ep027
1506,under his budget of seven hundred and,ep027
1509,fifty thousand dollars I think I'm ready,ep027
1512,yeah thank you thank you so much beer,ep027
1515,and chips breakfast the champion yes,ep027
1518,Cheers,ep027
1521,what do you think that beach bungalow,ep027
1524,west of five four seven nineteen that,ep027
1527,was a great place the location was,ep027
1530,pretty much unbelievable that's the,ep027
1533,beach lifestyle right great outdoor,ep027
1536,entertaining space,ep027
1539,that's that extra little casita which is,ep027
1542,cool but on the downside you know it was,ep027
1545,really small and it was you know towards,ep027
1548,the top end of my budget and he thought,ep027
1551,of work yeah but that's definitely a,ep027
1554,good option okay then there was that,ep027
1557,bungalow that was just east of the five,ep027
1560,"that was pretty much turnkey for 670,000",ep027
1563,that was a pretty interesting option it,ep027
1566,was a great space I could move right in,ep027
1569,it was bigger which is nice true and the,ep027
1572,backyard was awesome great entertaining,ep027
1575,space if I could add a roof deck that,ep027
1578,have notion you that would make that,ep027
1581,property pretty compelling still only,ep027
1584,have the one bathroom though and the,ep027
1587,freeway noise I just don't know if I can,ep027
1590,get past that then there was the move-in,ep027
1593,ready traditional Cape Cod listed for,ep027
1596,seven hundred and ten thousand dollars I,ep027
1599,didn't like the fact that it was a,ep027
1602,little bit further from the beach but,ep027
1605,the fact that I had the ocean view it,ep027
1608,was the biggest of the three and it had,ep027
1611,a great outdoor entertaining space it,ep027
1614,did have the HOA though yeah they chose,ep027
1617,a bit of a drag because does at your,ep027
1620,monthly housing cost right I just have,ep027
1623,to think about whether or not I want to,ep027
1626,be that far from the water,ep027
1629,you would be treating your beach,ep027
1632,lifestyle yeah or a nicer home right so,ep027
1635,Dave what are you gonna do man,ep027
1638,[Music],ep027
1641,[Music],ep027
1644,well you know I really wanted to be,ep027
1647,close to the beach but after thinking,ep027
1650,about it a lot I think I want to make an,ep027
1653,offer on that traditional Cape Cod with,ep027
1656,the ocean view I got such a good vibe,ep027
1659,walking out on that deck and seeing the,ep027
1662,ocean those views are unbelievable and I,ep027
1665,can really picture myself you know,ep027
1668,moving right in there and being happy,ep027
1671,there for the long term I think I'm,ep027
1674,ready to make an offer all right so I've,ep027
1677,been in the house for just over three,ep027
1680,weeks the experience of being a,ep027
1683,first-time homebuyer has definitely been,ep027
1686,a learning one Trevor helped me out a,ep027
1689,lot,ep027
1692,through the process which was great the,ep027
1695,house was listed at seven hundred and,ep027
1698,ten thousand and through a lot of,ep027
1701,negotiations we were able to close at,ep027
1704,six hundred and seventy five thousand I,ep027
1707,redid all the carpet on the stairs and,ep027
1710,upstairs I love the back patio it's so,ep027
1713,nice and private so fun to have friends,ep027
1716,over and the other thing is the feel I,ep027
1719,just can't believe that I was able to,ep027
1722,get that view in my price range you,ep027
1725,don't mind being on the east side of the,ep027
1728,vibe you know what I thought a lot about,ep027
1731,it and I really don't I compromise by,ep027
1734,buying east of the five but at the end,ep027
1737,of the day I'm only a mile and a half,ep027
1740,from the water and I got more square,ep027
1743,footage I got an ocean view long-term,ep027
1746,this house really sets me up for where I,ep027
1749,want to be potentially where I want to,ep027
1752,you know start a family raise kids makes,ep027
1755,a lot more sense for my future I just,ep027
1758,feel so fortunate to be in this home,ep027
1761,seems pretty special I'm still pinching,ep027
1764,myself,ep027
1767,[Music],ep027
12,[Music],ep028
15,you asked for colonial and I deliver,ep028
18,[Music],ep028
21,Annie has grand plans for her future,ep028
24,home in the Washington DC area smoking,ep028
27,rooms /library,ep028
30,this room can fit your table and to,ep028
33,honor her Mayflower ancestors the older,ep028
36,the house the better 1927 I like that 90,ep028
39,years old it's probably got a lot of,ep028
42,character inside can her more practical,ep028
45,minded friend Tammy rein her in it's a,ep028
48,little bit smaller than I was hoping for,ep028
51,but needs and wanna make it better needs,ep028
54,and what oh isn't it gorgeous sweet,ep028
57,there's Roman statues out there it's so,ep028
60,big,ep028
63,[Music],ep028
66,my name is Annie and I work in,ep028
69,information technology specializing in,ep028
72,federal customers they're so cute my,ep028
75,family has been in the United States for,ep028
78,a very long time my mom's family came,ep028
81,over on the Mayflower in 1620 and my,ep028
84,father's family came over shortly,ep028
87,thereafter,ep028
90,did you know there's a special exhibit,ep028
93,going on right now I'm a member of the,ep028
96,Daughters of the American Revolution or,ep028
99,the DAR and the Society of Mayflower,ep028
102,descendants this is gorgeous yeah I love,ep028
105,this I'm so proud of my ancestors who,ep028
108,fought for freedom for independence for,ep028
111,democracy and humanity I'm also honored,ep028
114,by my pilgrim ancestors who were willing,ep028
117,to leave everything they had in England,ep028
120,and to come to America since the spring,ep028
123,finally showed up I've been in the DC,ep028
126,area since 2003 it's been a great place,ep028
129,to live because it is so diverse and so,ep028
132,filled with culture and activities and,ep028
135,it's beautiful my current home is a,ep028
138,condo in Alexandria Virginia it's 621,ep028
141,square feet I really enjoy its location,ep028
144,what I don't like is that it's very tiny,ep028
147,so I'm looking forward to moving into a,ep028
150,much bigger home I go all the way back,ep028
153,to the Charlemagne Charlemagne yes,ep028
156,helping Annie on her search is her close,ep028
159,friend Tammy the advantage of having her,ep028
162,look at houses with me is that she keeps,ep028
165,me in line I want to ensure that she's,ep028
168,looking at the big picture the picture,ep028
171,that's the day in the picture that's,ep028
174,tomorrow because she travels quite,ep028
177,frequently for work it's very important,ep028
180,that she does not obtain too much house,ep028
183,that could be hardly manageable if that,ep028
186,makes sense yeah but I really I would,ep028
189,prefer bigger house,ep028
192,Annie's looking for a spacious three bed,ep028
195,two and a half bath home close to,ep028
198,Washington DC my budget is about seven,ep028
201,hundred thousand I'd like it to be a,ep028
204,little bit less if I can but I recognize,ep028
207,that in the DC area it's hard to find,ep028
210,what I'm looking for for a much less,ep028
213,than that what did you think it I can't,ep028
216,caught I feel claustrophobic when I'm in,ep028
219,kick cards with a slant to really pitch,ep028
222,call me home if they feel like they have,ep028
225,this historic charm you know they really,ep028
228,have a lot of a lot of character I'm,ep028
231,really looking for an older house,ep028
234,possibly something that was built in the,ep028
237,1800s,ep028
240,preferably colonial style because it,ep028
243,reminds me of my family history Tami's,ep028
246,pushing for a newer or updated home,ep028
249,I love historic charm however when I,ep028
252,think of an older home my brain kind of,ep028
255,immediately goes to what happens to a,ep028
258,home it's been there for a long time,ep028
261,things like pipes or mold those are,ep028
264,things that just creep up and they could,ep028
267,be a large expense for her I'm a big,ep028
270,believer that you can make something new,ep028
273,and look old what's the number one,ep028
276,detail effect within the home that,ep028
279,you're looking for I love old hardwood,ep028
282,floors if I can find a house Danny would,ep028
285,like an updated kitchen with an open,ep028
288,layout but with the rest of the house,ep028
291,she wants some traditional elements I'm,ep028
294,looking for a wood-burning fireplace of,ep028
297,a dining room where I can have at least,ep028
300,a 12 person table in an office it's a,ep028
303,two-car garage and also have a library I,ep028
306,have this vision of the library having,ep028
309,dark green walls with dark wood in it,ep028
312,somewhere back in the day it would have,ep028
315,been a smoking room an unfinished,ep028
318,basement will be better than a finished,ep028
321,basement because I won't feel bad about,ep028
324,putting three tiered shelves all over it,ep028
327,you think nothing's too big that's,ep028
330,exactly right,ep028
333,I'm concerned about you buying so much,ep028
336,house because you drop a lot you don't,ep028
339,really want to be able to entertain,ep028
342,maybe I would be home more often if I,ep028
345,had a house fit so less business travel,ep028
348,due to increased number of rooms in your,ep028
351,home maybe maybe okay,ep028
354,we're in Herndon yes a little bit a,ep028
357,little bit further out of the city a lot,ep028
360,of it further out of the city,ep028
363,we're not that far it it's about,ep028
366,approximately 20 miles outside of,ep028
369,Washington DC but you're gonna get more,ep028
372,space for the house three bedrooms two,ep028
375,and a half baths just under 2500 square,ep028
378,feet garage right around the back and,ep028
381,price-wise 660 nice stuff I need space,ep028
384,to spread out we got colonial for you it,ep028
387,is a funny looking it definitely looks,ep028
390,more like a Cape Cod and I really don't,ep028
393,like that yellow bridge but we got some,ep028
396,other things that you do like aged 1927,ep028
399,1927 I like that 90 years old mm-hmm,ep028
402,it's probably got a lot of character,ep028
405,inside I mean that could be fixed uh you,ep028
408,know how much I want a house with,ep028
411,historic character mix with some moola,ep028
414,so just keep that in mind this is,ep028
417,gorgeous this is gorgeous it does keep,ep028
420,its 1920s care okay I feel like this is,ep028
423,truly the historic charm with the,ep028
426,chandeliers the cool ceiling the molding,ep028
429,the hard floors okay beautiful you're,ep028
432,gonna love his office space or not the,ep028
435,main floor - this is cute this is a good,ep028
438,size for being tucked away I do have one,ep028
441,question though yeah yeah these do not,ep028
444,look like updated windows some are,ep028
447,updated in the house not all of them are,ep028
450,some are updated good to know hmm they,ep028
453,look at the half bath in basements,ep028
456,before heading to the kitchen it's kind,ep028
459,of closed off back here that isn't it,ep028
462,this is an addition this is the back,ep028
465,wall here so this is used to be part of,ep028
468,the backyard okay so that's a tile floor,ep028
471,they did a great job also no newer,ep028
474,window right here notice you said window,ep028
477,without an S this is wonderful this is a,ep028
480,great patio and there it looks like,ep028
483,there's plenty of room to put a hot tub,ep028
486,but it is a lot to take care of on your,ep028
489,own I'm not concerned at all about the,ep028
492,size,ep028
495,alright you go in there and just make a,ep028
498,right what a great room a smoking room,ep028
501,is kind of a smoking room / the library,ep028
504,this is a cool room dining room right,ep028
507,next door,ep028
510,[Music],ep028
513,this room can fit your table they go,ep028
516,upstairs to look at a bonus base bedroom,ep028
519,and bath not sure about the stripes on,ep028
522,the wall but it looks like it's been,ep028
525,updated recently I like the granite it's,ep028
528,a nice guest bathroom this is an awkward,ep028
531,designed room this is weird,ep028
534,it's almost looks like an office space,ep028
537,awesome library to me and it's a little,ep028
540,bit awkward to be an office with this,ep028
543,tea shape and the slanted ceilings upset,ep028
546,Cape Cod coming back Cape Cod elements,ep028
549,[Laughter],ep028
552,like what the Masters on the other side,ep028
555,of the house this is super awkward again,ep028
558,just like the other bedroom so this,ep028
561,bathroom is a little bit small I do like,ep028
564,the tile looks like it needs some work,ep028
567,though I'm looking at these fixtures,ep028
570,this gets back to when's the last time,ep028
573,these pipes have been updated and that's,ep028
576,something we can look into this house,ep028
579,surprised me doesn't feel like a,ep028
582,colonial to me at all I really don't,ep028
585,like the yellow brick but the first,ep028
588,floor was amazing with that huge,ep028
591,fireplace however those bedrooms with,ep028
594,the t-shape I felt like there was sort,ep028
597,of a waste of space I can sort the size,ep028
600,I'm think it's a lot of space to manage,ep028
603,the other thing is renovations and,ep028
606,updates that may be needed it adds up,ep028
609,you know I'd really love to see more of,ep028
612,a traditional colonial and maybe,ep028
615,something closer to DC okay I can,ep028
618,definitely make that happen,ep028
621,awesome but for Annie to get the updated,ep028
624,colonial she wants and still stay close,ep028
627,to DC something's got again yikes I,ep028
630,thought the house looked tiny now you,ep028
633,tell me it's tiny,ep028
636,[Music],ep028
639,I found this awesome house it's like,ep028
642,5200 square feet but it's not amazing,ep028
645,"working with $700,000 annie is searching",ep028
648,the Washington DC suburbs for a spacious,ep028
651,colonial with historic charm and,ep028
654,character but knowing that Annie travels,ep028
657,a lot for work for more practical minded,ep028
660,friend Tammy is pushing her to get a,ep028
663,smaller updated house that's easier to,ep028
666,manage I can camp out in a room a week,ep028
669,just experience you know that's a good,ep028
672,idea so far they've seen a colonial that,ep028
675,had plenty of room for Annie's library,ep028
678,office and dining table for 12 but it,ep028
681,had more of a Cape Cod feel which Annie,ep028
684,didn't like and was 20 miles from DC so,ep028
687,you asked for a colonial and I deliver,ep028
690,looks cute I love that it's a red brick,ep028
693,colonial the landscaping in the front is,ep028
696,beautiful and they're in Arlington,ep028
699,Virginia just four miles from Washington,ep028
702,DC built in 1946 historic elements on,ep028
705,the outside completely gutted though and,ep028
708,renovated on the inside three bedrooms,ep028
711,two baths price 620 another positive,ep028
714,"1,450 square feet this is a really",ep028
717,highly desirable area,ep028
720,I know Annie's looking for more space,ep028
723,and when you look at what she's willing,ep028
726,to pay this was gonna be probably the,ep028
729,best in terms of the closest location,ep028
732,where is the driveway it's just straight,ep028
735,parking I mean it is permitted at night,ep028
738,though okay okay I think it's we're,ep028
741,taking a look at your but really the,ep028
744,nuts and bolts of,ep028
747,[Music],ep028
750,this is nice are these the original,ep028
753,hardwood floors I don't know if they're,ep028
756,all original I think it probably at some,ep028
759,point they probably had to switch some,ep028
762,al hmm it has molding and hardwood,ep028
765,floors and a lot of accents that I,ep028
768,really like but I do miss some of the,ep028
771,historic charm that Colonials have to,ep028
774,offer where's where's the dining room so,ep028
777,the iron is right behind you Wow let's,ep028
780,just refer to it as the multi-use dining,ep028
783,room this dining room family room living,ep028
786,room that is a lot yeah fit into this,ep028
789,small space we're closer to the city it,ep028
792,this is gonna be that trade-off in ice,ep028
795,cream though I like the updates I like,ep028
798,the paint color in this kitchen,ep028
801,I love these granite countertops the,ep028
804,glass pane cabinet doors it's just the,ep028
807,layout the fact that it is so open it is,ep028
810,it's inviting we can alter but it does,ep028
813,feel small it's a lot larger than your,ep028
816,condo kitchen I mean this is a pretty,ep028
819,functional pizza space it is but I'm,ep028
822,looking for this place I can stay for a,ep028
825,long time Thanks oh this is nice,ep028
828,beautiful green grass 0.15 in terms of,ep028
831,the lot size no that's not very big it's,ep028
834,pretty good-sized yard they go back,ep028
837,inside to look at the finished basement,ep028
840,quite a renovation yeah exactly it's,ep028
843,also the third bedroom I mean you might,ep028
846,have to use this is like a combo space,ep028
849,like as a guest room and your family,ep028
852,room right sort of like the first floor,ep028
855,another room might have to have ten,ep028
858,purposes or ignite it they look at the,ep028
861,attached bathroom as well doc yes and,ep028
864,then head upstairs to the top floor like,ep028
867,the stairwell,ep028
870,Wow once again it's really small it's,ep028
873,all renovated but you said it's only two,ep028
876,full baths so this is the master bath,ep028
879,yes it is and this will be the other,ep028
882,bath for people to use so okay I really,ep028
885,wanted two and a half baths and I really,ep028
888,wanted that half bath on the first level,ep028
891,for guests and unfortunately this,ep028
894,doesn't have it they look at the two,ep028
897,bedrooms next to the bath wow this is,ep028
900,nice and big scented ceiling so a little,ep028
903,bit claustrophobic but the room is so,ep028
906,spacious that's face the fact that was,ep028
909,built in the 1940s and is a traditional,ep028
912,red brick colonial is wonderful and I,ep028
915,like that it's been updated and,ep028
918,renovated I think this car footage of 14,ep028
921,fifties perfect size for her to move,ep028
924,into but the way the rooms are cut up,ep028
927,their multi-purpose like the fakirs not,ep028
930,a clear dining room is definitely gonna,ep028
933,be an issue for her lifestyle doesn't,ep028
936,have a driveway it doesn't have a garage,ep028
939,it is severely lacking space pretty much,ep028
942,everywhere we have some other ones a,ep028
945,look at and we'll go from there okay,ep028
948,okay to give Annie the space she wants,ep028
951,her agents taking a chance by showing,ep028
954,her a newer home this is it it doesn't,ep028
957,look like a colonial TJ,ep028
960,I really love that cabinet that has the,ep028
963,silver that's really pretty not pretty,ep028
966,Annie wants to honor her Mayflower roots,ep028
969,by buying an older colonial style home,ep028
972,in the Washington DC suburbs but in her,ep028
975,"$700,000 price range",ep028
978,finding a house with the architectural,ep028
981,detail she likes and the space she needs,ep028
984,has been a challenge so far she and her,ep028
987,close friend Tammy have seen a colonial,ep028
990,in Herndon 20 miles from DC she liked,ep028
993,the historic details inside but the,ep028
996,layout was awkward and it needed work,ep028
999,then they saw a red brick colonial in,ep028
1002,Arlington just four miles from DC she,ep028
1005,liked the upgrades but was concerned,ep028
1008,that it was too small so now they're,ep028
1011,back in Herndon to look at a newer more,ep028
1014,spacious house like a colonial TJ you,ep028
1017,know it's listed as a traditional with,ep028
1020,some Victorian elements while she wanted,ep028
1023,the colonial the thing that really spoke,ep028
1026,to me is that she wanted charm and,ep028
1029,character in the house this house has,ep028
1032,that in spades also to the fact that,ep028
1035,it's newer versus older there's less,ep028
1038,maintenance less renovation price on,ep028
1041,this house six hundred thousand that is,ep028
1044,nice but no driving the balances yeah,ep028
1047,there's no driveway no garage but it's a,ep028
1050,"little over 2,200 square feet it's a",ep028
1053,little bit smaller than I was hoping for,ep028
1056,but needs and want a cube Erika needs,ep028
1059,and what let's go this way picket fence,ep028
1062,super cute what do you think the front,ep028
1065,porch is cute yeah beautiful red I love,ep028
1068,the red door,ep028
1071,I like the entryway I like the hardwood,ep028
1074,floors taken got a mentioned earlier I,ep028
1077,background molding head over here to the,ep028
1080,living room and check it take the rest,ep028
1083,of the house hey this is a nice,ep028
1086,fireplace it's wood-burning and there's,ep028
1089,two of them there's too much even better,ep028
1092,so yeah totally better,ep028
1095,it's an awesome mantle I really like I'm,ep028
1098,really like they would work on them ice,ep028
1101,like a character table in I thought you,ep028
1104,might ask for that I think it may be,ep028
1107,doing with a round they'd be a little,ep028
1110,bit better no no it's a set an option if,ep028
1113,I extended it out into the living room,ep028
1116,what do you thing about the fixtures you,ep028
1119,know they're honestly they're a little,ep028
1122,bit more modern you know I tend to like,ep028
1125,that more yeah colonial an historic,ep028
1128,style and these don't necessarily have,ep028
1131,historic charm,ep028
1134,we got dining room all right small small,ep028
1137,spinny you have like a little galley,ep028
1140,kitchen but you know I really want an,ep028
1143,open kitchen but it is a manageable,ep028
1146,amount of space right ish they passed,ep028
1149,through the breakfast nook and sunroom,ep028
1152,before going to the backyard I like this,ep028
1155,it is so beautiful you know for chess,ep028
1158,there's out there it's so big the other,ep028
1161,thing too is just to highlight while,ep028
1164,we're out here that's the basement,ep028
1167,entrance but he moves it's not finished,ep028
1170,but it's great for storage basement,ep028
1173,concerns me it doesn't even feel safe,ep028
1176,right - yeah it's a safety perspective,ep028
1179,that concerns me I'm really gonna have,ep028
1182,to think about that yeah your,ep028
1185,bookshelves because she talks about a,ep028
1188,library which is kind of tough to put,ep028
1191,into rooms I liked about did you have,ep028
1194,this option they head upstairs to look,ep028
1197,at two bedrooms this could be a good,ep028
1200,home office space yeah do you like that,ep028
1203,it has wood floors and a jack-and-jill,ep028
1206,bathroom before heading to the master,ep028
1209,suite this is big this is nice I like it,ep028
1212,you don't want to miss the master bath,ep028
1215,Devin I'm glad it has its own ooh I like,ep028
1218,these floors clearly this has been,ep028
1221,updated no tub that's cool because they,ep028
1224,still work and though that's really,ep028
1227,pretty,ep028
1230,yeah I like the color schemes too,ep028
1233,[Music],ep028
1236,so what do you guys think about the,ep028
1239,house I really liked it actually I was,ep028
1242,surprised it's not a colonial and it's,ep028
1245,not old it has so much character and it,ep028
1248,has a beautiful yard and very inside,ep028
1251,that yard it is so large and also do you,ep028
1254,really need this much house actually a,ep028
1257,part of me thinks maybe the house isn't,ep028
1260,big enough it doesn't have a driveway it,ep028
1263,doesn't have a garage it has an exterior,ep028
1266,entrance to the basement it's really,ep028
1269,close to the neighbors I'm not sure what,ep028
1272,to do I feel like I have so much to,ep028
1275,think about since none of the houses has,ep028
1278,every one of Annie's must-haves she'll,ep028
1281,have to decide between style size or,ep028
1284,kitchen layout Annie has looked at,ep028
1287,several homes in the Washington DC,ep028
1290,"suburbs that are within her $700,000",ep028
1293,budget with the help of her friend Tammy,ep028
1296,she's ready to make a decision,ep028
1299,her first option is a yellow brick,ep028
1302,colonial in Herndon listed at six,ep028
1305,hundred and sixty thousand dollars a lot,ep028
1308,of things I like love that it's an older,ep028
1311,house it's nine years old but it has a,ep028
1314,lot of aesthetics beautiful hardwood,ep028
1317,floors that stone fireplace it had all,ep028
1320,those cool rooms like that office that,ep028
1323,was hidden in the back there's cigar,ep028
1326,slash library room when you've heard,ep028
1329,before a library and the dining would,ep028
1332,actually fit your tall person that's,ep028
1335,true that it would and it's the only,ep028
1338,house that we sat with a garage it has a,ep028
1341,nice updated kitchen except the kitchen,ep028
1344,was very separate from the other rooms,ep028
1347,don't love that it's about yellow quite,ep028
1350,frankly and the bedrooms are really,ep028
1353,awkward my only concern is the size,ep028
1356,let's talk about that red brick colonial,ep028
1359,in Arlington for 620 landscaping was,ep028
1362,gorgeous the landscaping is beautiful,ep028
1365,and I really like the red brick feel,ep028
1368,it's close to DC much closer than the,ep028
1371,other two houses that we saw renovations,ep028
1374,were gorgeous they did a great job my,ep028
1377,concerns about that house really our,ep028
1380,around space I think square footage-wise,ep028
1383,it's perfect for you but the space the,ep028
1386,way it's cut makes no sense for you I,ep028
1389,didn't like the fact that it was like,ep028
1392,one multi-purpose dining slash living,ep028
1395,it had that renovated basement what they,ep028
1398,count that,ep028
1401,bedroom and there is no master bath so,ep028
1404,let's talk about the Victorian,ep028
1407,traditional house at 600 I thought I,ep028
1410,wanted a colonial but that house is so,ep028
1413,beautiful it still had a hardwood floors,ep028
1416,and they're super cool molding it is in,ep028
1419,your home and that's the high positive,ep028
1422,from a maintenance perspective he took,ep028
1425,me to travel you don't to worry about it,ep028
1428,as much I don't love that it's a newer,ep028
1431,home though you know I really wanted,ep028
1434,something that was old and had a lot of,ep028
1437,charming character the basement,ep028
1440,definitely makes me nervous I don't like,ep028
1443,the exterior entrance at all I'm still,ep028
1446,concerned about the size of it there's a,ep028
1449,lot of yard there's a lot of upkeep if,ep028
1452,you will at the landscaping Tammy I want,ep028
1455,the Victorian Victorians of cheapest,ep028
1458,it's got a nice dining room it's got a,ep028
1461,basement even if it is awkward it has a,ep028
1464,couple potential options for a library I,ep028
1467,want you to be happy so I'm watching,ep028
1470,your shoes whatever yours gonna make you,ep028
1473,happy and bring you joy thank you I,ep028
1476,appreciate that I think that house is,ep028
1479,the winner okay high five I'm Liam back,ep028
1482,in the office I think I've owned the,ep028
1485,home for a few weeks and I've been,ep028
1488,living in it for a few days I still have,ep028
1491,so much to do I'm still in the process,ep028
1494,of unpacking my boxes it's fun I was,ep028
1497,definitely looking for a house maybe a,ep028
1500,hundred years older than this house but,ep028
1503,I really appreciate it actually than,ep028
1506,it's newer because I think it still has,ep028
1509,a lot of the historic charming character,ep028
1512,yet I have all of the modern amenities,ep028
1515,didn't you find it like old dog tags,ep028
1518,yeah in the basement when I moved into,ep028
1521,this house I found a letter from the,ep028
1524,seller with dog tags they were from the,ep028
1527,original owner of this house who is a,ep028
1530,world war two vet in a Korean War vet I,ep028
1533,plan to do some of his genealogy and,ep028
1536,maybe even make a shadowbox and keep it,ep028
1539,with us,ep028
1542,hi I'm one of my Derby hat I haven't,ep028
1545,done any renovations yet but something I,ep028
1548,plan to do in the near term is look at,ep028
1551,how to put an interior entrance to the,ep028
1554,basement,ep028
1557,I love owning this house because I,ep028
1560,really enjoy the privacy and the and the,ep028
1563,ability to do whatever I want Cheers,ep028
1566,to new beginnings,ep028
12,[Music],ep029
15,it's a two-story colonial which I know,ep029
18,you love Keisha Keisha and husband,ep029
21,Algernon are searching Lancaster,ep029
24,Pennsylvania for a large home for,ep029
27,themselves and their young sons there's,ep029
30,enough room for the kids to run around,ep029
33,and play and a finished basement is more,ep029
36,important than usual since Keisha is,ep029
39,trying to avoid homes with grassy lawns,ep029
42,the yard is absolutely fabulous nasally,ep029
45,and I did take allergy medicine this,ep029
48,morning,ep029
51,well these to be able to come to terms,ep029
54,oh oh goodness see that's that,ep029
57,fixer-upper that,ep029
60,[Music],ep029
63,I'm Kecia and I'm Algernon,ep029
66,I am an associate professor of,ep029
69,Communication Arts and Sciences and I am,ep029
72,a student support services and a,ep029
75,Harriott Keisha and I met 9 years ago,ep029
78,and we have been married for almost,ep029
81,seven you get one of them is usually,ep029
84,very outgoing he is the true definition,ep029
87,of an extrovert Keisha is a beautiful,ep029
90,introverted woman who loves her,ep029
93,quietness but with two rambunctious boys,ep029
96,Keisha's quiet times are few and far,ep029
99,between our children are very are full,ep029
102,of energy,ep029
105,this was mommy swinglish she was little,ep029
108,I used to swing back here we have a,ep029
111,three-year-old and a one-year-old and in,ep029
114,the summer and on holidays they're,ep029
117,joined by Al's 10 year old Rex so not,ep029
120,surprisingly they want to get out of,ep029
123,their cramped townhouse and buy a larger,ep029
126,home here in Lancaster where Keisha grew,ep029
129,up and where her parents still live,ep029
132,Lancaster has all sorts of things that I,ep029
135,think are really good the downtown area,ep029
138,is growing in leaps and bounds but,ep029
141,you're also very close to the city but,ep029
144,you can get to Philadelphia an hour and,ep029
147,a half and so it gives you the best of,ep029
150,both worlds I really hadn't thought,ep029
153,about this particular style the style of,ep029
156,house that I like is a two-story,ep029
159,colonial because it gives me sort of a,ep029
162,clear separation between the shared,ep029
165,space versus the private space this,ep029
168,one's kind of neat the style of house,ep029
171,that I desire is a ranch-style being,ep029
174,able to run around your house and not,ep029
177,have to either climb up or climb down,ep029
180,makes for a desirable space the budget,ep029
183,for that home is about two,ep029
186,"180,000 it looks long but it doesn't",ep029
189,look very open I love an open floor plan,ep029
192,especially having kids I love the fact,ep029
195,that you know they can roam around and,ep029
198,you can see what they're getting into,ep029
201,the floor plan that I desire is very,ep029
204,structured because I think it just,ep029
207,presents an opportunity for our very,ep029
210,young boys to know that oh this is our,ep029
213,play areas we need about four bedrooms I,ep029
216,definitely need it office space I do a,ep029
219,lot of work from home a spa tub to,ep029
222,unwind in is also at the top of Keisha's,ep029
225,list it's not much of a yard but also,ep029
228,desire a yard that the boys can go,ep029
231,outside and roam and get dirty I had,ep029
234,terrible allergies to grass and I would,ep029
237,definitely prefer to have a smaller yard,ep029
240,but the kids need somewhere to play,ep029
243,there could be parks very close to the,ep029
246,house I would like a formal dining room,ep029
249,I would love to have a nice-sized,ep029
252,basement to have a space where we could,ep029
255,have the large TV and the kids would,ep029
258,also be able to have an indoor play,ep029
261,space this house to me means an,ep029
264,opportunity for us to plant some roots,ep029
267,this is it it's a to sir colonial which,ep029
270,I know your love Keisha well you know it,ep029
273,better be fabulous to Rita because you,ep029
276,know I wanted my ranch I know this is a,ep029
279,four bedroom two and a half bath home,ep029
282,"it's a little over 1,800 square feet and",ep029
285,a list price is 280 thousand that's a,ep029
288,little on the high end hi come on in,ep029
291,guys this is nice we're gonna have to,ep029
294,replace that oh good see that's that,ep029
297,fixer-upper that we did all right let's,ep029
300,check out the living room okay it's a,ep029
303,little smaller than I was hoping for,ep029
306,yeah,ep029
309,the living room is definitely very small,ep029
312,it doesn't conform to the open floor,ep029
315,plan at our desire I like that this,ep029
318,house is not an entirely an open floor,ep029
321,plan because it gives the opportunity to,ep029
324,sort of break things up check out the,ep029
327,dining room it's a little smaller than I,ep029
330,want it though once we would have the,ep029
333,dining room table in here with the,ep029
336,chairs and the china cabinet let's be,ep029
339,cool tight yeah look at this what do you,ep029
342,guys think about this is nice I,ep029
345,definitely like this space fish you,ep029
348,Shari pigs everything,ep029
351,the yard is absolutely fabulous oh but I,ep029
354,already feel a little like nasally and I,ep029
357,did take allergy medicine this morning I,ep029
360,think she might come around being that,ep029
363,it has a lot for the kids back inside,ep029
366,they see the kitchen this is nice I,ep029
369,think I can make this work I definitely,ep029
372,love the white cabinets I definitely,ep029
375,loved that countertops not sure if we,ep029
378,have enough cabinets that is true they,ep029
381,see a powder room off the kitchen before,ep029
384,heading down to the basement all right I,ep029
387,like this I like this a lot there's a,ep029
390,little small but it still gives you that,ep029
393,separation you want it so you can have,ep029
396,that formal living room upstairs and,ep029
399,downstairs you're gonna have the kids,ep029
402,upstairs on the second floor are three,ep029
405,guest bedrooms I think it's a good size,ep029
408,for an office and the master suite this,ep029
411,is kind of an odd shape but you see how,ep029
414,it's almost like a hunk of the room it's,ep029
417,sort of cut out it's big enough for a,ep029
420,king-size bed in here so it's an odd,ep029
423,space but it's a lot of space all right,ep029
426,let's check out the master bathroom it's,ep029
429,very modern but it's so small and you,ep029
432,know I absolutely want a spot oh it's,ep029
435,just a shower I use a baths as a way to,ep029
438,relax and the fact that this master bath,ep029
441,does not have a spa tub is disappointing,ep029
444,to me I think I like it more than I,ep029
447,don't I like the fact that the yard is,ep029
450,large I love the deck but it really does,ep029
453,concern me because what am I gonna have,ep029
456,to just kind of stand in the kitchen and,ep029
459,look out the window at them as they're,ep029
462,enjoying this doesn't necessarily have,ep029
465,the open floor plan that I desired but I,ep029
468,really don't care for that master yeah I,ep029
471,must have that tub and this house,ep029
474,doesn't have that since Algernon is,ep029
477,looking for a ranch-style home Cerreta,ep029
480,has lined one up hoping the low price,ep029
483,point wins Keshia over this is a,ep029
486,four-bedroom two-bath home and it's way,ep029
489,under budget that smells nice and fruity,ep029
492,very fruity with a growing family of,ep029
495,three young boys Keisha and Algernon are,ep029
498,looking for a home with room for,ep029
501,everyone this is really good,ep029
504,you would fool around I think this is,ep029
507,like regular juice they want to stay,ep029
510,near family in Lancaster but they don't,ep029
513,agree on what they want in a home so far,ep029
516,"they've seen an 1,800 square foot",ep029
519,two-story colonial with space for a home,ep029
522,office and formal dining room for Kisha,ep029
525,it was at the top of their 280 thousand,ep029
528,dollar budget and wasn't Algernon style,ep029
531,so agent Sarita is hoping the lower,ep029
534,price point combined with his preferred,ep029
537,ranch-style home will hit the mark,ep029
540,I found the ranch that you want at all,ep029
543,what do you think I like the fact that,ep029
546,it's a ranch well this is a four-bedroom,ep029
549,"two-bath home 1,300 square feet and is",ep029
552,way under budget at 225 well we like the,ep029
555,fact that it's 225 thousand the price of,ep029
558,the house is great,ep029
561,and it leaves room for if there's any,ep029
564,improvements needed we can definitely do,ep029
567,without any issues okay I like the,ep029
570,floors,ep029
573,I'd open it something great well you,ep029
576,definitely have sort of that open space,ep029
579,you know going kind of pump one area to,ep029
582,the next that open floor plan now Keisha,ep029
585,I know you wanted a formal dining room,ep029
588,yeah this is your formal dining room,ep029
591,here oh wow more like a dinette do,ep029
594,that's disappointing,ep029
597,I don't even know if her table would fit,ep029
600,in there no I definitely wouldn't fit,ep029
603,you just have to make sure you have room,ep029
606,for a refrigerator oh my goodness and,ep029
609,the dishwasher don't freeze no,ep029
612,dishwasher and a small dining room table,ep029
615,"225 thousand join in 25,000 ideally I",ep029
618,would not be in favor of a big,ep029
621,renovation however there are so many,ep029
624,things that we could potentially do with,ep029
627,this house I wouldn't be opposed to,ep029
630,sitting down with the contractor and,ep029
633,talking through some things,ep029
636,oh this is nice it reminds me of patios,ep029
639,back in Florida I like the size I like,ep029
642,the openness of it mm-hmm I definitely,ep029
645,like the how the glass is you know the,ep029
648,doors go the whole way around and that's,ep029
651,all of the Sun come in and then right,ep029
654,over here is the koi pond oh this is,ep029
657,lovely the kids what are you well what's,ep029
660,that being so let's check out the,ep029
663,outdoor area okay,ep029
666,wow this is nice to me this ride is,ep029
669,pretty big and I'm already concerned,ep029
672,about my allergies Keisha's allergies,ep029
675,are are definitely concerned but I love,ep029
678,the size of the yard and the kids would,ep029
681,definitely have a joy in playing in it,ep029
684,I'm a little nervous with the pool just,ep029
687,seems like it we have the potential to,ep029
690,be a little dangerous if even if we're,ep029
693,out here neither of us are really,ep029
696,swimmers back inside there's a,ep029
699,bathroom and two guest bedrooms I think,ep029
702,this could be actually a nice office,ep029
705,space so this room actually would be,ep029
708,considered your master bedroom,ep029
711,Wow it's the largest bedroom on this,ep029
714,floor wow this is small SRIA,ep029
717,I'll get it would not fit in here they,ep029
720,head downstairs to a finished basement,ep029
723,this absolutely could work as another,ep029
726,living space the TV could easily fit,ep029
729,there also - there's enough room for the,ep029
732,kids to run around and play in all right,ep029
735,now this bedroom also has a bathroom,ep029
738,attached to it so this could be,ep029
741,considered a master bedroom suite move,ep029
744,I'm not sure how I feel about the the,ep029
747,master suite not being on the same level,ep029
750,as the kids like that's something that's,ep029
753,pretty important to me okay it,ep029
756,definitely has the jetted tub this is,ep029
759,nice it is perfect all right so what do,ep029
762,you guys think I love the fact that you,ep029
765,found us a ranch that's just fabulous,ep029
768,the kitchen no I think probably we have,ep029
771,to gut this outside is absolutely,ep029
774,beautiful,ep029
777,my allergies will go crazy back there,ep029
780,was that great the bedroom in the,ep029
783,basement is not gonna work well for us,ep029
786,but something that I just thought about,ep029
789,maybe that could function as my office,ep029
792,that is true so now their agents lined,ep029
795,up a house she thinks will appeal to,ep029
798,both of them I love the landscape I love,ep029
801,the brick I really like this,ep029
804,[Music],ep029
807,Kiesha and al are tired of townhouse,ep029
810,living and are eager for more space in,ep029
813,Lancaster Pennsylvania working with a,ep029
816,two hundred and eighty thousand dollar,ep029
819,budget they've seen a two-story colonial,ep029
822,with space for a home office for Keisha,ep029
825,it was at the top of their budget but,ep029
828,wasn't Alice preferred ranch-style then,ep029
831,they saw an under budget ranch with a,ep029
834,huge finished basement for Al but there,ep029
837,wasn't a formal dining room for Keisha a,ep029
840,nice swing smooth follow through I'm,ep029
843,going to step back and let you do it,ep029
846,so now they're headed to another option,ep029
849,a brick colonial that should be right up,ep029
852,his alley,ep029
855,not your ranch al but it's absolutely,ep029
858,gorgeous what do you think I love the,ep029
861,landscape I love the brick I really like,ep029
864,this this is three bedrooms three full,ep029
867,"bathrooms a little under 1,800 square",ep029
870,"feet and 270,000 all right Wow we're",ep029
873,still on the budget this is beautiful,ep029
876,and it's open and I actually like it but,ep029
879,I just really struggle with how would we,ep029
882,be able to keep the kids safe in here,ep029
885,today I think they would just running,ep029
888,and knocking things over because there,ep029
891,isn't a way to sort of stop them but,ep029
894,that's the point of why I wanted an open,ep029
897,floor plan so they could just run and we,ep029
900,can see where they were going I wouldn't,ep029
903,touch it well this is nice it's very,ep029
906,nice I like the floating cabinet mm-hmm,ep029
909,well this is definitely an updated,ep029
912,traditional style kitchen I think is,ep029
915,perfect so this space would be,ep029
918,considered your dining area but Keisha,ep029
921,this house only has three bedrooms so,ep029
924,this would also have to function as your,ep029
927,home office I really want something,ep029
930,that's separate and off by itself well,ep029
933,there is a basement space that you might,ep029
936,be able to use I guess there's something,ep029
939,to think about now the bathroom on this,ep029
942,floor is a,ep029
945,bathroom with a shower suddenly sighs I,ep029
948,like that there is a shower mm-hmm hey,ep029
951,step outside to see the backyard I love,ep029
954,this yard space I like the brick I like,ep029
957,the stone this is not perfect for your,ep029
960,allergies right absolutely perfect for,ep029
963,my allergies,ep029
966,it's pristinely maintained I don't know,ep029
969,if I will be able to keep it up back,ep029
972,inside they head downstairs to the,ep029
975,basement Keisha I already know what,ep029
978,you're gonna say this is it because it,ep029
981,would either have to be their office the,ep029
984,play area that like it's not gonna be,ep029
987,able to double I am really disappointed,ep029
990,with the basement it's small I have no,ep029
993,idea what we would do with that space,ep029
996,upstairs on the second floor they see a,ep029
999,full bath and a possible office for,ep029
1002,Keisha I definitely see where it could,ep029
1005,function as an office space but and it,ep029
1008,would make us lose a bedroom and since,ep029
1011,this is only a three-bedroom we need the,ep029
1014,rooms for kids so this is the master,ep029
1017,bedroom,ep029
1020,wow this is nice very nice I like the,ep029
1023,fact that the bed is like tucked away in,ep029
1026,like a little cubby mm-hmm right over,ep029
1029,here is the master bathroom I love that,ep029
1032,it has a separate door the double sinks,ep029
1035,are very nice but where is the shower,ep029
1038,the shower is actually in the same space,ep029
1041,with the toilet we would not be able to,ep029
1044,get in there could you imagine me in the,ep029
1047,shower and you honor the fact that it,ep029
1050,doesn't have a regular tub and most,ep029
1053,certainly not a spa tub is disappointing,ep029
1056,to me the final bedroom is upstairs in,ep029
1059,an attic space Wow I don't even think,ep029
1062,you'll be able to stand up in here oh,ep029
1065,wow yeah the ceilings look really low,ep029
1068,I think Rex might like it up here but,ep029
1071,little guys hmm,ep029
1074,I want me comfortable with that yeah,ep029
1077,all right guys so what do you think it's,ep029
1080,not my ranch but she did gives me an,ep029
1083,open floor plan but the open floor plan,ep029
1086,still just really concerns me with our,ep029
1089,very small children now I love that,ep029
1092,backyard I love that there's limited,ep029
1095,grass the garden is beautiful I don't,ep029
1098,know if I could manage the upkeep now,ep029
1101,Keisha and I'll have to decide what's,ep029
1104,most important an allergy friendly yard,ep029
1107,an open floor plan or office space for,ep029
1110,Keisha I think we need to make a,ep029
1113,decision okay let's make it I think we,ep029
1116,need to make a decision okay with a,ep029
1119,"280,000 dollar budget Keisha I'll are",ep029
1122,eager to get more space for their,ep029
1125,growing family and decide on a house so,ep029
1128,what do you think about the great,ep029
1131,"two-story colonial that's 280,000 I like",ep029
1134,that the rooms are sectioned off at,ep029
1137,their walls that clearly define where,ep029
1140,the living room is the dining room,ep029
1143,the dining room might be a bit small but,ep029
1146,you know what I absolutely love the deck,ep029
1149,out back it could be a nice entertaining,ep029
1152,space but that yard is humongous I know,ep029
1155,you think that I could take allergy,ep029
1158,medicine but that's a lie the basement,ep029
1161,in this house,ep029
1164,I see where it perhaps could be a TV,ep029
1167,room but where would the kids be able to,ep029
1170,have their area down there and that was,ep029
1173,one of the things that we said was,ep029
1176,pretty important to us the master,ep029
1179,bathroom it's definitely very modern,ep029
1182,contemporary and newly done but it's not,ep029
1185,what I wanted there isn't a tub like I,ep029
1188,really really wanted a spa tub and,ep029
1191,there's just a Steve and shower so what,ep029
1194,do you think about the ranch at 225,ep029
1197,thousand well you know I like the fact,ep029
1200,that it is a ranch but it's not an open,ep029
1203,floor plan but you know it doesn't feel,ep029
1206,and close to me yeah I'd agree,ep029
1209,there isn't a dining room right now you,ep029
1212,know in terms of the kitchen the size of,ep029
1215,it just would not work it definitely,ep029
1218,would be a total gut job,ep029
1221,but since the house is so under budget,ep029
1224,we can customize,ep029
1227,make it the way that I want to the yard,ep029
1230,is also something that we have to think,ep029
1233,about you know me you know my allergies,ep029
1236,that might be a bit much what did you,ep029
1239,think about the brick colonial listed at,ep029
1242,two hundred and seventy thousand it was,ep029
1245,nice you know I absolutely love the open,ep029
1248,floor plan but with our kids they're,ep029
1251,gonna be running and knocking over,ep029
1254,everything and that just concerns me ya,ep029
1257,know I did like the dining room area yes,ep029
1260,I thought that was pretty nice my,ep029
1263,biggest concern is that where in the,ep029
1266,world what I put an office that will be,ep029
1269,your office and I have no idea how that,ep029
1272,could potentially work I just wouldn't,ep029
1275,be able to focus you know the basement,ep029
1278,is way too small for a media room maybe,ep029
1281,that could be your office the basement,ep029
1284,could be a space where I could sort of,ep029
1287,shut myself off quietly to get some work,ep029
1290,done the master had a really interesting,ep029
1293,feel to it even though it's clean it is,ep029
1296,relatively small so which one will they,ep029
1299,pick,ep029
1302,[Music],ep029
1305,even though it has that huge yard and,ep029
1308,I'll probably be taking a lot of allergy,ep029
1311,medicine I really think the two-story,ep029
1314,"great colonial at 280,000 might be the",ep029
1317,spot for us I can't talk you into that,ep029
1320,ranch nope,ep029
1323,the two-story great colonial has,ep029
1326,everything we need it looks like we need,ep029
1329,to call Serena yep the house was listed,ep029
1332,at 280 thousand and we ended up paying,ep029
1335,two hundred and eighty three five and we,ep029
1338,moved in about two weeks ago two weeks,ep029
1341,my office is working out wonderfully,ep029
1344,I feel so settled and focused and I,ep029
1347,think it allows me also to be a better,ep029
1350,mother and wife because I can focus,ep029
1353,my most favorite thing about the house,ep029
1356,is the yard the mere fact that I can,ep029
1359,just go out and walk around and the kids,ep029
1362,can go out there and run around it has,ep029
1365,been such a joy it's different I have to,ep029
1368,admit I was right with that yard the,ep029
1371,kids absolutely loved playing and having,ep029
1374,a great time,ep029
1377,you definitely are agreed though we've,ep029
1380,seen many happy wonderful years in this,ep029
1383,home but we see ourselves growing and,ep029
1386,being happy for a long long long time,ep029
1389,[Music],ep029
12,oh my god I love it,ep030
15,love it single mom Michelle is searching,ep030
18,Phoenix Arizona for a family-friendly,ep030
21,house with plenty of room to entertain,ep030
24,oh this is beautiful,ep030
27,she's asked her niece Cristina along to,ep030
30,advise I love everything about it,ep030
33,everything but that oh my gosh of course,ep030

42,here that has stealth personality,ep030
45,self-doubt but I'm still gonna renovate,ep030
48,it,ep030
51,[Music],ep030

78,bringing my visions to life,ep030
81,[Music],ep030
84,my daughter's name is Madison she's nine,ep030
87,years old in the gymnastics team so she,ep030
90,literally flips around the house doesn't,ep030
93,walk on her feet she walks at our hands,ep030
96,that's pretty much my job,ep030
99,I live in Cave Creek Arizona its,ep030
102,outskirts of Phoenix I absolutely love,ep030
105,it out here it's a very rural area it's,ep030
108,more of a small town Phil hey,ep030
111,she and Madison currently live in a,ep030
114,house she bought and remodeled two years,ep030
117,ago I moved to this house after getting,ep030
120,a divorce but I wanted to stay in my,ep030
123,daughter's school district plus I wanted,ep030
126,to us to have a more of a larger,ep030
129,backyard however I want to move because,ep030
132,even though I love that having an,ep030
135,acreage property,ep030
138,my daughter is playing by herself all,ep030
141,the time there's no kids in the,ep030
144,neighborhood cuz there is no,ep030
147,neighborhood so I just want a,ep030
150,neighborhood which there's children,ep030
153,place where she can play odds take two,ep030
156,black coffee,ep030
159,so Michelle's decided to buy a home in,ep030
162,Phoenix where she can have a,ep030
165,neighborhood feel and be close to the,ep030
168,city center it's a great place tons of,ep030
171,wonderful restaurants I love the fact,ep030
174,that we are four hours from the beach in,ep030
177,Rocky Point Mexico and the mountains are,ep030
180,within driving distance and Flagstaff,ep030
183,now I've never done yoga before I will,ep030
186,go gentle kristin is my knees and I want,ep030
189,her in my house hunt because she will,ep030
192,tell me the truth I'm very opinionated,ep030
195,but she can handle my personality she,ep030
198,kind of will get very adventurous and,ep030
201,everything will become a complete,ep030
204,renovation so I feel like I'll be the,ep030
207,voice of reason and I'm like the calm to,ep030
210,her dorm Oh crazy I will never find a,ep030
213,move-in-ready house I don't think,ep030
216,there's a house here,ep030
219,it has Michelle's personality Michelle,ep030
222,style so I want a house that's close as,ep030
225,I could possibly get but I'm still gonna,ep030
228,renovate it that's just who I am but I,ep030
231,think finding something that has the,ep030
234,least amount of need to renovate would,ep030
237,be the best option for her since she did,ep030
240,such a massive renovation with the house,ep030
243,that she's currently in Michelle has a,ep030
246,"budget of $500,000 which includes any",ep030
249,renovation costs and she's looking for a,ep030
252,3-bed 2bath home in my vision it's like,ep030
255,a white farmhouse with like black,ep030
258,shutters and a really huge porch like,ep030
261,wraps around,ep030
264,my dream home is a farmhouse I'm from,ep030
267,western Pennsylvania where that's where,ep030
270,farmhouses are they have a lot of charm,ep030
273,and unique features in the home however,ep030
276,we're in Arizona so that Stout isn't,ep030
279,here so I try to take any other house,ep030
282,and make it look like a farmhouse,ep030
285,maybe there's some historic kind of,ep030
288,places that have some charm for Michelle,ep030
291,I want something that has a cozy feel,ep030
294,but still give the space an elegant,ep030
297,Flair a lot of historic houses and,ep030
300,Phoenix bungalows little cozy receiving,ep030
303,some tutors mom they are small but they,ep030
306,have a nice appeal and what about the,ep030
309,kitchen that's like you're not the most,ep030
312,important thing to me so I have to have,ep030
315,a large kitchen and I want it open cuz,ep030
318,we're not have parties everyone always,ep030
321,congregates the kitchen and having the,ep030
324,same white farmhouse style kitchen,ep030
327,details she has in her current home,ep030
330,would be ideal and Nicole have to have a,ep030
333,pool and then still a space for,ep030
336,entertaining what if you don't find a,ep030
339,pool biggest 120 degrees in the summer,ep030
342,and Phoenix so yes I need a pool a,ep030
345,dedicated home office slash craft room,ep030
348,rounds out her list this house would be,ep030
351,a new start for me and Madison I'm ready,ep030
354,for this new chapter in our lives,ep030
357,first up is a spanish-style house but,ep030
360,it's in a family-friendly neighborhood,ep030
363,perfect for Madison it is brown,ep030
366,definitely very Brown and I don't see a,ep030
369,front porch this is not a front porch,ep030
372,hello rocking chairs run courts like,ep030
375,really a bench over there but this house,ep030
378,fits your needs it's a four bedroom two,ep030
381,"and a half bath house just under 4,000",ep030
384,square feet and it's listed at 4:36,ep030
387,okay well that's in budget,ep030
390,oh my gosh I love the feeling I love it,ep030
393,love it oh and the floors like I love,ep030
396,that herringbone power to give the towel,ep030
399,that's beautiful it's let's head to the,ep030
402,office oh well what is that way it's,ep030
405,cutting is not chair in the floor I feel,ep030
408,like at the cheetah gotta go they take a,ep030
411,peek at the half bath the fixtures,ep030
414,aren't bad you can't replace everything,ep030
417,whatever and move on to the living room,ep030
420,more renovations are using the area okay,ep030
423,let's go to the formal dining rooms,ep030
426,what's definitely nice to have extra,ep030
429,space like that but what do you call it,ep030
432,seriously like what is this what is it,ep030
435,and why'd they stop right here okay,ep030
438,check it off do more renovations okay,ep030
441,I like the square footage however this,ep030
444,house does not have them at historic,ep030
447,term that I'm looking for but I love the,ep030
450,French doors well you love something,ep030
453,[Music],ep030
456,seriously the yard is a great size and,ep030
459,look at this great covered patio yeah,ep030
462,true but I'm still mad at a pool come on,ep030
465,remember your budget okay whatever,ep030
468,oh my gosh these floors arms to dad for,ep030
471,it's so big and spacious and open but,ep030
474,this gotta go I don't like these,ep030
477,countertops,ep030
480,of course cabinet colors even though,ep030
483,they're nice alder cabinets but the,ep030
486,color is not my I do right you do like,ep030
489,that white and gray the farmhouse look I,ep030
492,do like so the backsplash have to go,ep030
495,this would have to go in the college the,ep030
498,kitchen is already nice as it is it was,ep030
501,open it was just what she wanted I don't,ep030
504,think she needs to renovate it at all,ep030
507,well this is nice and open,ep030
510,plenty of room for medicines but I would,ep030
513,have to tear this wall down tear the,ep030
516,wall down oh you don't need to tear the,ep030
519,wall down yes yes you have more space to,ep030
522,do her little flips all right let's head,ep030
525,straight into the master oh I love the,ep030
528,double doors that's really nice I like,ep030
531,that and it's a good-sized master I love,ep030
534,the crown molding I can seem like,ep030
537,sighs beg gone here that do you like it,ep030
540,the windows are great now it does have,ep030
543,the same carpet but I know you weren't,ep030
546,fond of but good condition I'm not a fan,ep030
549,well I think you're gonna love the,ep030
552,master bath we'll look tile I love them,ep030
555,- oh yes - stinks nice fixtures they,ep030
558,look at a guest bath and three more,ep030
561,bedrooms it's probably the biggest so I,ep030
564,was thinking Madison would probably want,ep030
567,this room the full-size Becka sitting,ep030
570,here I think this house might be just a,ep030
573,little bit too big for Madison and,ep030
576,Michelle it's just the two of them so,ep030
579,what did you think I did love the,ep030
582,vaulted ceilings I loved how it was like,ep030
585,a wild factor and I walked in I love the,ep030
588,master and you get a craft room but the,ep030
591,outside the exterior was really,ep030
594,seriously Brown I did not have my front,ep030
597,porch in the backyard,ep030
600,no pool I really had to put a pool in,ep030
603,you cannot find that size kitchen I,ep030
606,agree with you it's some things maybe,ep030
609,change like I definitely would change,ep030
612,the color of the cabinets you know I'm,ep030
615,like more of a farmhouse table white the,ep030
618,countertops would have to be changed the,ep030
621,black backsplash bath would be changed,ep030
624,cuz that's just not my style so now her,ep030
627,agents lined up a house that has more of,ep030
630,the farmhouse vibe Michelle is looking,ep030
633,for oh and look that means you've got a,ep030
636,covered porch I do like,ep030
639,[Applause],ep030
642,aren't the kids just in a play yeah they,ep030
645,just finished up I'm Peter Pan they're,ep030
648,so talented like their mother,ep030
651,Michelle is searching Phoenix Arizona,ep030
654,for a home to share with her 9 year old,ep030
657,daughter Madison problem is if it's not,ep030
660,in the white farmhouse style she loves,ep030
663,Michelle will remodel it even if it's a,ep030
666,gut job so level-headed nice christina,ep030
669,is along to keep her from going,ep030
672,"overboard and blowing her $500,000",ep030
675,budget so far they've seen a,ep030
678,spanish-style house in a family-friendly,ep030
681,neighborhood but it doesn't have the,ep030
684,farmhouse details Michelle wants and,ep030
687,there's no pool so now they're going to,ep030
690,see a ranch house in Southeast Phoenix,ep030
693,it's a suburban area but it has a more,ep030
696,rural feel all the houses here you can,ep030
699,have horses different animals larger lot,ep030
702,sizes you know what it has the farmhouse,ep030
705,feel that I like and it's in a nice,ep030
708,neighborhood love the mature trees,ep030
711,landscaping is beautiful,ep030
714,I could see Madison flipping around,ep030
717,climbing the trees out here to climb the,ep030
720,trees all day every day I mean you've,ep030
723,got a covered porch I do like it it's a,ep030
726,3-bedroom 2bath home and it's listed at,ep030
729,490 that's not much room for renovations,ep030
732,it's a very pretty dog long part but I,ep030
735,think you're gonna like a lot of the,ep030
738,features all right so this is the dining,ep030
741,room in the house I wouldn't eat this,ep030
744,room for a dining room I'm not sure what,ep030
747,I would use it for but I'll keep an open,ep030
750,mind on it I'm not a fan of wood tile it,ep030
753,would have to all come up it does look,ep030
756,shutters partition shadow it's really,ep030
759,nice well I do like it's nice and open,ep030
762,and I love the stone fireplace that's,ep030

822,I have to add a pool for services and,ep030
825,there's features inside you'll really,ep030
828,like so maybe it'll offset the price is,ep030
831,negotiable may be able to get it for,ep030
834,lower okay what can I say love this,ep030
837,thing the concrete really deep love the,ep030
840,six and that's pretty much squared into,ep030

867,this out this whole area out your,ep030
870,renovation list is going way up,ep030
873,you'd be buried in renovations again but,ep030
876,like during renovations I know you did,ep030
879,but that was the point is not to have to,ep030
882,do so much okay let's keep looking head,ep030
885,straight through to the master bedroom,ep030
888,so I gotta go through the dining room to,ep030

924,yeah it's a good size right it is a good,ep030
927,thick before heading to the third,ep030
930,bedroom it could be a good craft room or,ep030
933,office that's a good option yeah,ep030
936,[Music],ep030
939,I love the feel that I got a house like,ep030
942,the whole farmhouse kind of feel that I,ep030

957,thing yeah you guys pretty much it and,ep030
960,the kitchen renovations are a little bit,ep030
963,they're expensive but you never know the,ep030
966,price is negotiable maybe we could get,ep030
969,it for less that's true I mean the space,ep030
972,with likely bodies but it did not have a,ep030
975,pool right and I really really wanted to,ep030
978,pull so this next house has the pool,ep030
981,Michelle wants and then some it does,ep030
984,have a great single mom Michelle is,ep030

990,"Arizona within her $500,000 budget so",ep030
993,she can cover any additional renovation,ep030
996,costs but trying to find a balance,ep030
999,between her grand remodeling ideas and,ep030
1002,the bottom line has been a challenge,ep030
1005,with her niece Cristina along to advise,ep030
1008,they've seen two houses one that had,ep030
1011,plenty of entertaining space but didn't,ep030
1014,have the farmhouse details Michelle,ep030
1017,wants the other looked like a farmhouse,ep030
1020,but it was on the high end of her budget,ep030
1023,and neither house had a pool,ep030

1239,those touches of old and beautiful maybe,ep030
1242,we did a great job in this bathroom,ep030
1245,I love everything about it everything,ep030
1248,but that oh my gosh of course you would,ep030
1251,find one thing that you don't like,ep030
1254,that's got all right so upstairs is the,ep030
1257,master bedroom and bathroom oh wow you,ep030
1260,have to see this I love it a clawfoot,ep030
1263,tub and look at these floors they are,ep030
1266,gorgeous kind of an interesting shape,ep030
1269,though it works in here though and now,ep030
1272,your shoe works this is true I am,ep030
1275,vertically challenged this is true come,ep030
1278,check out the bedroom oh this is awkward,ep030
1281,it's like a lot of ankles going on and,ep030
1284,I'm just not sure that would work for me,ep030
1287,Jen,ep030
1290,it does have a cute little walkout,ep030
1293,balcony that overlooks the backyard okay,ep030
1296,oh whoa what do you think about the,ep030
1299,house the house has a lot of charm it's,ep030
1302,really cute but a big negative for me,ep030
1305,that kitchen I would literally have to,ep030
1308,knock out that whole entire section yeah,ep030
1311,and what I would do that whole section,ep030
1314,out and I would have to make it bigger,ep030
1317,to be more open but the pool was great I,ep030
1320,wasn't cool the backyard kudos on that,ep030
1323,it was gorgeous,ep030
1326,I don't think I haven't changed,ep030
1329,absolutely anything out there yeah still,ep030
1332,none of the homes has escaped Michelle's,ep030
1335,renovating I so it could all come down,ep030
1338,to the place that has her farmhouse,ep030
1341,style a pool or the most space I really,ep030
1344,wanted to go through the houses and make,ep030
1347,the right decision,ep030
1350,michelle has been searching Phoenix,ep030
1353,Arizona for a house to share with her,ep030
1356,daughter Madison with the help of her,ep030
1359,niece Kristina she's looked at several,ep030
1362,"options in her $500,000 price range now",ep030
1365,she's ready to make a decision three,ep030
1368,thing about that two-story Spanish,ep030
1371,stucco that was that Nick it was 436 it,ep030
1374,didn't have your front porch or your,ep030
1377,pool no it didn't,ep030
1380,but it was beautiful inside had high,ep030
1383,ceilings I mean the style of the house,ep030
1386,is not the style that I like however I,ep030
1389,love the space of that kitchen the,ep030
1392,granite had to change something I don't,ep030
1395,think the kitchen was even that bad it,ep030
1398,really was a beautiful kitchen just as,ep030
1401,is you know the house kind of seems big,ep030
1404,it's like four thousand something square,ep030
1407,feet right I don't know it's just the,ep030
1410,two of you do you really need that much,ep030
1413,space what did you think about the ranch,ep030
1416,"farmhouse that was listed at 490,000 it",ep030
1419,feels like it was in a rural area a,ep030
1422,country but yet it still wasn't them it,ep030
1425,definitely was some bear style and then,ep030
1428,with the farmhouse look and that front,ep030
1431,yard was gorgeous the view is beautiful,ep030
1434,he had a covered porch however the,ep030
1437,kitchen would really need completely,ep030
1440,redone it didn't have your pool but I,ep030
1443,can add a pool but that Tudor home that,ep030
1446,was great,ep030
1449,that was listed at 475 it has just a,ep030
1452,beautiful charm that I love and unique,ep030
1455,touches to it,ep030
1458,it did have a front porch and did have a,ep030
1461,pool you have a lot of outside space,ep030
1464,that whole cupboard area was gorgeous,ep030
1467,but it was,ep030
1470,just awkward in place that I was to have,ep030
1473,to do renovation and they did a great,ep030
1476,job transitioning the upgrades but,ep030
1479,keeping some of that the feel the tutor,ep030
1482,I am really leaning toward that,ep030
1485,two-story stuck up it's quite large,ep030
1488,school on a square footage I'm gonna go,ep030
1491,a lot more from my money so then are you,ep030
1494,decided I really think so,ep030
1497,yeah well yeah I'm better get on the,ep030
1500,phone call Jen I posed in the house,ep030
1503,about 30 days ago we set in the house,ep030
1506,for the first time last night,ep030
1509,on the couch we had our renovations done,ep030
1512,first and they just finished to,ep030
1515,yesterday so we had some furniture,ep030
1518,delivered but our beds aren't here yet,ep030
1521,but it was really great to finally be in,ep030
1524,the house last night I just walked in,ep030
1527,and saw the renovations and just knew,ep030
1530,this was definitely home that looks good,ep030
1533,so so far the changes I've made I've,ep030
1536,painted all of downstairs,ep030
1539,I changed the office I completely took,ep030
1542,out the fireplace in the living room and,ep030
1545,replaced it with stone in the dining,ep030
1548,room put wainscotting in there the,ep030
1551,kitchen was the largest remodel instead,ep030
1554,of tearing out the cabinets I went ahead,ep030
1557,and just painted them white and put,ep030
1560,granite and change the backsplash out to,ep030
1563,subway tile in the future probably the,ep030
1566,very first thing I'm going to do is add,ep030
1569,a pool as well as an outdoor kitchen my,ep030
1572,brand new wood butcher block is this I,ep030
1575,don't think I renovated that much yet,ep030
1578,you didn't renovate that much yet but,ep030
1581,you definitely did put your own Flair,ep030
1584,and it's great thank you,ep030

129,and now we get to it you know think,ep031
132,about the fun the other night yeah we,ep031
135,got to figure out our,ep031
138,hello is a big city but it's also under,ep031
141,the radar I don't have the major traffic,ep031
144,the major you know problems that come,ep031
147,with big city is kind of a good neighbor,ep031
150,town so we definitely want to stay,ep031
153,around here and start a family of our,ep031
156,own right now we live in my parents,ep031
159,house well I don't know what my parents,ep031
162,are doing so they might be home any,ep031
165,second I just want to get out of their,ep031
168,way they're great but we need our own,ep031
171,place yeah it's time and although this,ep031
174,is their first place they're not looking,ep031
177,for a starter home I want that forever,ep031
180,home I don't want to have to move in,ep031
183,five or ten years that's a big reason,ep031
186,why we're here without our parents house,ep031
189,saving money is so that we can get to,ep031
192,the next level and kind of skip a step,ep031
195,and it's time we start talking about,ep031
198,what we can really afford so this we're,ep031
201,gonna input some information how much do,ep031
204,we want to spend two hundred twenty-five,ep031
207,I really think we should start at three,ep031
210,hundred at the top and see if we can,ep031
213,really swing it,ep031
216,we are both coming out from different,ep031
219,points I'm coming here from the realm of,ep031
222,what do we actually need and at least,ep031
225,coming from the realm of I want,ep031
228,everything all right let's see what we,ep031
231,got here all right I mean it is what it,ep031
234,is yeah still manageable I still think,ep031
237,that we can make that work yes you do,ep031
240,they're going to have to fight it out on,ep031
243,style too,ep031
246,look how cute this is from the outside,ep031
249,nice colonial my style is colonial I,ep031
252,really like two-story houses so look at,ep031
255,that nice symmetry and the shutters on,ep031
258,each window she likes the charm and,ep031
261,character of an older home while Jordan,ep031
264,prefers the look of a split-level home I,ep031
267,grew up in a split-level so it's,ep031
270,comfortable to me it makes sense less,ep031
273,long stairwells it's like oh you got a,ep031
276,couple stairs here a little bit there so,ep031
279,when we have some kids you know I don't,ep031
282,worry about my kids falling down a whole,ep031
285,bunch of stairs they both want three,ep031
288,bedrooms two baths and an open floor,ep031
291,plan but when it comes to finishes,ep031
294,and an open floor plan but when it comes,ep031
297,to finishes natalie is thinking a little,ep031
300,more high-end than Jordan we're looking,ep031
303,for a move-in-ready home and you get,ep031
306,what you pay for I want to go for a,ep031
309,course I want to go for granite,ep031
312,something that's gonna be more,ep031
315,long-lasting crown molding a bay window,ep031
318,I'm not I'm always looking for that not,ep031
321,a lot of homes around here have that but,ep031
324,Jordans coming around to the finer,ep031
327,things like the hardwood floors and I'll,ep031
330,give you the countertop thing okay I can,ep031
333,appreciate a nice countertop okay I've,ep031
336,come I've come to appreciate that all,ep031
339,right in my bathroom I'll give me my,ep031
342,bathrooms this whole concept of a master,ep031
345,suite sounds incredible and even though,ep031
348,that was a thing so yeah that I want yes,ep031
351,it was coming around I definitely want a,ep031
354,two-story foyer if I don't have that,ep031
357,it's an automatic feeling like there's,ep031
360,not enough space and that's another big,ep031
363,one for me is a family room the place,ep031
366,for our family to be a family ideally,ep031
369,it's carpeted I know Nalin legs hardwood,ep031
372,but I much prefer the coziness of the,ep031
375,carpet I know this is our first home but,ep031
378,it's gonna be our forever home so to me,ep031
381,go big or go home it's gonna be a home,ep031
384,either way right and it's gonna be big,ep031
387,first up is a colonial for Natalie but,ep031
390,it's priced at 280 thousand dollars,ep031
393,wait not exactly the number were looking,ep031
396,"to pay here well it is over 1,900 square",ep031
399,feet okay that's good that's a lot of,ep031
402,space three bedrooms okay one and a half,ep031
405,baths so it doesn't definitely have the,ep031
408,number of bathrooms I'm looking for,ep031
411,either then I'd really like to have to,ep031
414,fall okay well look at this curb appeal,ep031
417,its colonial nice symmetry,ep031
420,we've got shutters hmm a good balance,ep031
423,all right let's see what's inside,ep031
426,you,ep031
429,[Music],ep031
432,their wall is just darling,ep031
435,let's feel a little tight in here though,ep031
438,right it does it doesn't have that open,ep031
441,foyer that we're looking for,ep031
444,all right well let's take a look in the,ep031
447,living room we have a nice wood-burning,ep031
450,fireplace beautiful mantel you got over,ep031
453,here too,ep031
456,I know you wanted a bay window it's a,ep031
459,little tall but yeah I like how deep it,ep031
462,goes though definitely yeah,ep031
465,I look French door pretty French door,ep031
468,very just very charming across the foyer,ep031
471,is the dining room,ep031
474,nice big open you guys bay windows right,ep031
477,there I like it like that because it,ep031
480,matches the other room too very critical,ep031
483,for you sure,ep031
486,yeah one was in 1933 very charming I,ep031
489,think the details matter when you come,ep031
492,to think about a house that you wanted,ep031
495,to call your forever home,ep031
498,things like molding and the woodwork and,ep031
501,the charm and the character you don't,ep031
504,get that with everyday houses and the,ep031
507,kitchen looks gorgeous my goodness I,ep031
510,like the floor love the door the color,ep031
513,scheme the countertops are beautiful,ep031
516,quality countertop but I'm looking in,ep031
519,the cabinets are really nice this is,ep031
522,definitely a forever kitchen we don't,ep031
525,have to do any work to this I agree with,ep031
528,you yeah move-in ready is my style all,ep031
531,right let's check out this half bath,ep031
534,okay this is tiny,ep031
537,look at that tiny little sink yeah we're,ep031
540,old they head outside to the backyard,ep031
543,you've got a dog mm-hmm kids running,ep031
546,around on now drivers yeah I do okay,ep031
549,they head downstairs to see the finished,ep031
552,basement,ep031
555,it's a little cramped right droid uh,ep031
558,yeah my head there I like the space,ep031
561,though I like this I mean that you could,ep031
564,have like a nice kid's playroom down,ep031
567,here and everything,ep031
570,upstairs they see a small bedroom with a,ep031
573,bonus space sweet yoga room oh you do,ep031
576,yoga no no we could start now but I,ep031
579,could see it as you know it's a kid,ep031
582,bedroom here and though this could be,ep031
585,like a nice player,ep031
588,I could see it is you know it's the kid,ep031
591,bedroom here and oh this could be like a,ep031
594,nice player stairs they see a second,ep031
597,larger bedroom and then the shared,ep031
600,bathroom alright I wanted it to be huge,ep031
603,but it's not that big of a space it's a,ep031
606,bad size but I definitely would like it,ep031
609,to be bigger yeah it's nice tile though,ep031
612,I guess they redid the tile feels pretty,ep031
615,on the same floor is the master bedroom,ep031
618,Wow there is a lot of space here very,ep031
621,nice I like it,ep031
624,Natalie there's your baby windows like,ep031
627,this window this is so cute I could just,ep031
630,picture reading I'm that's a nice,ep031
633,little nook right there I like oh nice,ep031
636,yeah what do you do with the rest of the,ep031
639,space it looks like that's pretty much,ep031
642,the only place at the bug go because,ep031
645,we've got radiator on this side radio,ep031
648,room very critten yes one we have a,ep031
651,little okay I like the way you're,ep031
654,thinking I had it's my style 100%,ep031
657,colonial Americana the shutters it looks,ep031
660,great the kitchen is awesome it's just,ep031
663,good to go but that bathroom yeah I know,ep031
666,I'm missing I'm missing a shower but,ep031
669,it's got the charm that I like and the,ep031
672,character I know you know and I know and,ep031
675,it's got your hardwood that you like you,ep031
678,know that's up you did have some tighter,ep031
681,areas like that front foyer wasn't that,ep031
684,as open as we really would like it to be,ep031
687,just the overall layout it is a little,ep031
690,separated and sectioned off so maybe,ep031
693,something a little more open yeah to,ep031
696,find that open floor plan they're seeing,ep031
699,a newer build colonial but will they,ep031
702,have to sacrifice charm colonial but,ep031
705,front load garage so it does kind of,ep031
708,take away from that curb appeal,ep031
711,[Music],ep031
714,bird bird oh my gosh look at this little,ep031
717,guy,ep031
720,"with a max budget of $300,000 Jordan and",ep031
723,Natalie,ep031
726,with both the classic charm and modern,ep031
729,updates Nathalie is looking for but it's,ep031
732,missing the open floorplan they also,ep031
735,want now they're heading to a,ep031
738,contemporary colonial and although it's,ep031
741,not the split-level that Jordan wants,ep031
744,its price is appealing hey Trish how are,ep031
747,you,ep031
750,"this house is 250,000 it's three",ep031
753,bedrooms two and a half bathrooms in,ep031
756,"almost 2,400 square feet Wow and the",ep031
759,price range is a little more manageable,ep031
762,for me Yeah right good good so colonial,ep031
765,but front-load garage so it does kind of,ep031
768,take away from that curb appeal oh wow,ep031
771,look it's all feelings yeah love that so,ep031
774,we have the dining room here all right,ep031
777,let's look at the living room okay let's,ep031
780,do that thank you,ep031
783,Wow look at that space Jordan nice,ep031
786,carpeted living room I like it,ep031
789,the carpets gotta go that's for sure,ep031
792,fireplace is great how cool is this,ep031
795,mirror this mirror is hideous this is,ep031
798,awesome no I can't believe you like it,ep031
801,it's interesting I'm doing everything,ep031
804,right now no it is a colonial but it's,ep031
807,not that traditional colonial so when,ep031
810,you get into the house the character is,ep031
813,lacking you don't have that charm that,ep031
816,might be in a older home because it is a,ep031
819,newer build you've got the kitchen flows,ep031
822,right into here it's nice open space,ep031
825,yeah definitely love the open space,ep031
828,don't love the tile this tile is worn so,ep031
831,I feel like we got to tear this stuff,ep031
834,out when you look at this countertop,ep031
837,right here I mean this has got to get,ep031
840,replaced the overall the space here is,ep031
843,really nice to work with there's a lot,ep031
846,we can do with it you have cabinets in,ep031
849,this countertop mm-hmm I just feel like,ep031
852,money is just,ep031
855,I know you really wanted enough rated,ep031
858,countertop yeah if you were gonna put,ep031
861,these into courts they'd probably be,ep031
864,about six or seven thousand okay I,ep031
867,didn't realize it was gonna cost that,ep031
870,much that's all the top of the price,ep031
873,we're talking yeah does it happen that,ep031
876,all happen before we move in yeah you're,ep031
879,gonna want to do it before you move in,ep031
882,to be the easiest way okay nice patio,ep031
885,very nice but can we talk about the,ep031
888,elephant in the room which one well the,ep031
891,place that you don't even have kids yet,ep031
894,yeah but we have all kinds of nieces and,ep031
897,nephews the place that works here's my,ep031
900,big issue right okay I don't want a pool,ep031
903,I don't have to do all kinds of pool,ep031
906,maintenance I'm not even a big pool guy,ep031
909,true I don't know what it takes to,ep031
912,maintain a pool either they head back,ep031
915,inside and downstairs to the finished,ep031
918,basement this is more space now we're,ep031
921,talking is this pool table thing it is,ep031
924,it's stained and you've got this whole,ep031
927,area over here I mean we could do a,ep031
930,whole like entertainment center thing,ep031
933,this is a lot of space well guess what,ep031
936,we're gonna fill up this house and then,ep031
939,we're gonna populate it with a nice,ep031
942,family that's the whole point populate,ep031
945,oh then we're planning ahead that's why,ep031
948,we're getting this extra space upstairs,ep031
951,they look at two very colorful bedrooms,ep031
954,and a guest bathroom it's a good-size,ep031
957,space but the floor is a fever about at,ep031
960,the bottom floor downstairs more money,ep031
963,on the list,ep031
966,then they head into the master bedroom,ep031
969,this is greatly nice guys and you have,ep031
972,an in suite master bath okay this is a,ep031
975,big deal for us so the floor has to be,ep031
978,ripped out like these floors and just,ep031
981,imagine if we just bumped this whole,ep031
984,thing out and made a big this was like a,ep031
987,big shower said yeah,ep031
990,we have the money to do it let's,ep031
993,just-okay things to consider overall,ep031
996,there's really no lack of space and no,ep031
999,for me something that's missing here is,ep031
1002,that charm that you might find in an,ep031
1005,older home it's a newer build so it,ep031
1008,doesn't have the custom built in,ep031
1011,cabinets doesn't have the crown molding,ep031
1014,everything's kind of plain the living,ep031
1017,room and the basement there's the stars,ep031
1020,of the house for me my big concern is,ep031
1023,every room we walk into she says we,ep031
1026,gotta provide the full you know take,ep031
1029,down a big mirror I'm what Trish said it,ep031
1032,kind of sounds like we're gonna have to,ep031
1035,pour another 25 grand and at this place,ep031
1038,I want to France it's so crazy to me,ep031
1041,well for me that's kind of what I'm,ep031
1044,looking for those updates,ep031
1047,so we don't have them this may not be,ep031
1050,our house,ep031
1053,so now their agents taking them to a,ep031
1056,split-level home that's move-in ready,ep031
1059,but all those updates come at a cost,ep031
1062,"$2,000 honey right so that's way too",ep031
1065,much I found a place engaged couple,ep031
1068,Natalie and Jordan have been living with,ep031
1071,Natalie's parents while they look for a,ep031
1074,"house of their own for under $300,000",ep031
1077,first they saw a 1930s colonial charmer,ep031
1080,with upscale move-in-ready finishes but,ep031
1083,it didn't have an open floor plan or a,ep031
1086,second full bath then they saw a larger,ep031
1089,newer colonial with two and a half baths,ep031
1092,but it was short on charm and they,ep031
1095,thought the kitchen bathrooms and,ep031
1098,flooring would need to be redone now,ep031
1101,their agents lined up a move-in-ready,ep031
1104,split level which is Jordan's favorite,ep031
1107,style this house is 290 thousand dollars,ep031
1110,"towards $90,000 honey all right let's",ep031
1113,wait to watch two baths yep two full,ep031
1116,baths yep okay it is a split-level,ep031
1119,though you're interested in the spot a,ep031
1122,colonial right give it a shot,ep031
1125,[Music],ep031
1128,interesting like you can kind of see,ep031
1131,everything right through ya know the,ep031
1134,openness is good so far,ep031
1137,bamboo floors throughout this is the,ep031
1140,living room this is a good size right,ep031
1143,here because it's nice and open you know,ep031
1146,what I mean the whole thing kind of,ep031
1149,flows right and I'm feeling nice and,ep031
1152,tall over here but it just kind of,ep031
1155,slopes down and gets shorter and shorter,ep031
1158,and it's kind of cramping me it's part,ep031
1161,of the that's part of the architectural,ep031
1164,style here well it doesn't even lower,ep031
1167,into the den here okay it's a little bit,ep031
1170,more Excel oh I even so I can see it,ep031
1173,does start get a little cramped over,ep031
1176,here a sliding glass door leads into the,ep031
1179,backyard this is a really nice area I,ep031
1182,mean for dog kids whatever it is I could,ep031
1185,look forward to doing a lot of stuff,ep031
1188,this is again it's a nice yard yeah back,ep031
1191,inside they take a look at the kitchen,ep031
1194,which is open to the den we have the,ep031
1197,concrete counters throughout whoa I,ep031
1200,never would have guessed that no got a,ep031
1203,gauzy feel to it yeah for sure close,ep031
1206,right in here this is nice the stainless,ep031
1209,steel appliances are included nice and,ep031
1212,everything's been updated including all,ep031
1215,the cabinets that's a plus and the sink,ep031
1218,is a plus it's a nice big size so over,ep031
1221,here you have the breakfast bar or you,ep031
1224,can walk over into here right off the,ep031
1227,living room and there's a dining room,ep031
1230,gotcha okay and then upstairs you have,ep031
1233,two bedrooms and one full bath okay but,ep031
1236,this is what I don't like Jordan okay,ep031
1239,having options to go down or up I was,ep031
1242,just like oh nice clean good thing not,ep031
1245,in this case I will have to disagree,ep031
1248,with you let's go see the bedroom they,ep031
1251,take a look at the upstairs bathroom and,ep031
1254,then the first bedroom it's not huge but,ep031
1257,here's you're talking a kid's bedroom,ep031
1260,here right this is a nice deep closet,ep031
1263,right just get in there the second,ep031
1266,upstairs bedroom has a unique shape this,ep031
1269,is strange,ep031
1272,I'm calling this the hot dog room,ep031
1275,because it's long and lean and I prefer,ep031
1278,more of a hamburger style heading to the,ep031
1281,master bedroom,ep031
1284,this is nice this is a really good size,ep031
1287,this is so move-in ready mm-hmm,ep031
1290,yeah there is a cedar closet over here,ep031
1293,and you'll never get Maas or mold on the,ep031
1296,clothes they'll never smell funky oh,ep031
1299,cool like that how about this master,ep031
1302,bathroom it's huge this is just like a,ep031
1305,again a really nice area yeah nice space,ep031
1308,yeah it could be very tranquil we can,ep031
1311,decorate on this little ledge I really,ep031
1314,like it it's really nice it's up-to-date,ep031
1317,the kitchen is really nice it's got the,ep031
1320,cabinets the stainless-steel appliances,ep031
1323,the big sink and the floors are all,ep031
1326,cohesive throughout the house but in,ep031
1329,some parts of the house we've got nice,ep031
1332,tall ceilings but then that planted,ep031
1335,ceiling leading to the other parts of,ep031
1338,the house kind of makes me feel like a,ep031
1341,little claustrophobic definitely move-in,ep031
1344,ready that's a good thing yeah you're,ep031
1347,not kidding I mean I don't see any that,ep031
1350,we would have to make a change to well,ep031
1353,since none of the homes are a hundred,ep031
1356,percent what they're after it may come,ep031
1359,down to how important move-in ready,ep031
1362,really is to them I'm ready to get out,ep031
1365,of your parents house,ep031
1368,"with up to 300,000 dollars to spend",ep031
1371,engaged couple Jordan and Natalie have,ep031
1374,been looking at options for their first,ep031
1377,home together okay I have all the MLS,ep031
1380,listings okay let's take another look,ep031
1383,again what are you thinking about the,ep031
1386,colonial for 280 it's a great house and,ep031
1389,has a lot of charm that I'm looking for,ep031
1392,well I mean the kitchen is fantastic,ep031
1395,that's the small of the house for me he,ep031
1398,doesn't need any work whatsoever the,ep031
1401,color is really nice gorgeous what yeah,ep031
1404,and the bedrooms are all upstairs three,ep031
1407,bedrooms nice size but there's only one,ep031
1410,full bathroom and a half bath downstairs,ep031
1413,was really small time you think I've,ep031
1416,ever seen in my life but a lot of good,ep031
1419,character aunt agree,ep031
1422,small-time you think I've ever seen in,ep031
1425,my life but a lot of good character and,ep031
1428,a great neighborhood and then the,ep031
1431,contemporary colonial or 250 it's not,ep031
1434,the traditional colonial it's a lot of,ep031
1437,space it's tall ceilings so I don't feel,ep031
1440,cramped it's big thing for me is a two,ep031
1443,and a half bathroom a lot of work needs,ep031
1446,to be done here the carpets need to be,ep031
1449,ripped out sorry I know you like carpet,ep031
1452,but yeah definitely not that carpet it's,ep031
1455,old and dated and lived in and then you,ep031
1458,get to the kitchen which needs a lot of,ep031
1461,updates but when we start pouring money,ep031
1464,into floors making countertops and,ep031
1467,cabinets I don't really know where it,ep031
1470,stops,ep031
1473,so you're again you're getting up into a,ep031
1476,higher price range okay what level four,ep031
1479,to 90 three bedrooms two full bathrooms,ep031
1482,that's definitely what we're looking for,ep031
1485,"and plenty of space 1,000 square feet",ep031
1488,right it was open the way the house,ep031
1491,flowed was really nice it wasn't you,ep031
1494,know what I'm traditionally looking for,ep031
1497,that split-level in the slanted ceiling,ep031
1500,but it is the definition of movement,ep031
1503,right right it's definitely a contender,ep031
1506,so which one will it be,ep031
1509,[Music],ep031
1512,thinking ahead of the future in our,ep031
1515,family that we want,ep031
1518,I think the contemporary colonial has,ep031
1521,that layout that we're looking for and a,ep031
1524,lot of space to work with,ep031
1527,right so it's how willing are you to,ep031
1530,hold off on the things that I know you,ep031
1533,want especially when we're looking for a,ep031
1536,move-in ready right maybe it's something,ep031
1539,that we think about what really is,ep031
1542,necessary to do in the very short time,ep031
1545,period versus long term I totally agree,ep031
1548,I think we have a winner,ep031
1551,should we call Trish yes right now okay,ep031
1554,awesome well I got some pans here where,ep031
1557,are you gonna want those even though we,ep031
1560,closed last week so this is still fresh,ep031
1563,for us two choices here okay all right,ep031
1566,so I got this guy right here ready right,ep031
1569,that looks really nice the house was,ep031
1572,"listed at $250,000 and we were able to",ep031
1575,negotiate a little bit and save about,ep031
1578,"$10,000 so $240,000 for the house and",ep031
1581,now as far as improvements going I think,ep031
1584,"we'll probably be putting another 10,000",ep031
1587,or figuring it out for the walls we can,ep031
1590,have like a light gray on top and then,ep031
1593,like a darker gray kind of thing going,ep031
1596,on so up next for us is getting the,ep031
1599,walls painted and we definitely got to,ep031
1602,rip out this carpet and figure out if,ep031
1605,we're gonna hardwood the area or put in,ep031
1608,another carpet that keep you cozy,ep031
1611,conversations still need to happen we're,ep031
1614,gonna make those changes and we're gonna,ep031
1617,move in and you know get out of our,ep031
1620,parents house but you got one much more,ep031
1623,space that you can fix up with make it,ep031
1626,your home we're moving down the road,ep031
1629,we're taking steps we're getting married,ep031
1632,you know we're looking at family well,ep031
1635,now I have somewhere to put them this,ep031
1638,thing's like a real solid thing yeah,ep031
1641,success Cheers,ep031
1644,[Applause],ep031
12,I work as a construction superintendent,ep032
15,and these stones look fantastic yeah I'm,ep032
18,Megan I work as a government consultant,ep032
21,in Washington DC I cheesecake is good,ep032
24,yeah Chris my met at the Delaware,ep032
27,Beaches,ep032
30,we're both originally from Delaware and,ep032
33,we met through mutual friends we hit it,ep032
36,off right away but he didn't ask for my,ep032
39,number so we ran into each other a,ep032
42,couple more weekends and he finally,ep032
45,asked for it how was yours yeah Chris is,ep032
48,a wonderful man he is funny and he is so,ep032
51,kind to everyone I think Megan is,ep032
54,amazing she's very sweet she's very fun,ep032
57,she's just a great person we've been,ep032
60,together for four years married for six,ep032
63,months now hey can you grab my sweater,ep032
66,that goes with my green dress it should,ep032
69,be on the edge of the closet there,ep032
72,there's a lot of sweaters on the edge of,ep032
75,the closet Megan lived inside DC when we,ep032
78,first started dating diving in Delaware,ep032
81,at the time I'm not really a city person,ep032
84,so we've decided to move in together we,ep032
87,kind of met in the middle Northern,ep032
90,Virginia is just awesome all the history,ep032
93,the walking trails the biking trails the,ep032
96,breweries the wineries it just seems,ep032
99,like there's a never-ending amount of,ep032
102,stuff to do we ran a small condo it's a,ep032
105,two-bedroom two-bath it's been great to,ep032
108,us but we're ready to get into some,ep032
111,bigger they'd like to be less than an,ep032
114,hour from DC for Megan's commute and are,ep032
117,targeting Northern Virginia suburbs like,ep032
120,Ashburn and Leesburg well I know you,ep032
123,"think that 600,000 is expensive for the",ep032
126,house but we can take a look at what our,ep032
129,monthly payment would be and see if we,ep032
132,can afford it all right so I'll put in,ep032
135,six under and then where do we want to,ep032
138,buy maybe we just start in Leesburg,ep032
141,"2,800 I feel like that's right now they",ep032
144,just need to get on the same page about,ep032
147,what to buy I'm looking for a brick,ep032
150,branch,ep032
153,it is because I grew up in one we plan,ep032
156,to start a family I would love to find,ep032
159,something that we can grow into and to,ep032
162,be her forever home so four bedrooms,ep032
165,would suit her just fine I think we can,ep032
168,contain that in something smaller like a,ep032
171,three-bedroom single-family colonial or,ep032
174,townhome something like that where we,ep032
177,can move in five or ten years I don't,ep032
180,want to move in five years I want to,ep032
183,just get in there and stay Chris also,ep032
186,doesn't want to take work home with him,ep032
189,so he prefers move-in-ready you work in,ep032
192,construction,ep032
195,you could small projects is great but,ep032
198,it's our first home so I would love to,ep032
201,be able to move in and enjoy it for a,ep032
204,little bit an updated kitchen with tons,ep032
207,of storage is a must I would like a,ep032
210,walk-in pantry growing up we put food in,ep032
213,cabinets here at the condo we put food,ep032
216,in cabinets and it would just be nice to,ep032
219,have in a kitchen open to a living space,ep032
222,would be ideal because when I'm in the,ep032
225,kitchen I can look out and see him,ep032
228,sitting on the couch so one thing for me,ep032
231,definitely is a nice wall to mount the,ep032
234,big-screen TV we just can't do it in,ep032
237,here I know that Megan definitely wants,ep032
240,a formal dining room somewhere we laughs,ep032
243,oh yeah hardwoods would be great for,ep032
246,putting a large master suite is a given,ep032
249,and the master bath better be updated,ep032
252,and have a large tub office space is on,ep032
255,your wish list I think he's looking for,ep032
258,the basement or a man cave mm-hmm,ep032
261,somewhere we could eventually put like a,ep032
264,pool table or shuffleboard or a,ep032
267,ping-pong table or dartboard Wow another,ep032
270,beautiful spot I know this is gorgeous,ep032
273,an attached two-car garage in front and,ep032
276,a private yard out back round out the,ep032
279,list Megan and eyes aspirations are,ep032
282,definitely a little different I think,ep032
285,that's gonna be a struggle and we'll see,ep032
288,how it goes,ep032
291,cheers to our house here's the outlet,ep032
294,first up is a house in Sterling less,ep032
297,than an hour from Washington DC all,ep032
300,right I think this is it no garage not a,ep032
303,good start it's cute so bad I don't like,ep032
306,a ranch it's definitely more view house,ep032
309,than a me house but I think the commute,ep032
312,is great doctor ranch this is an,ep032
315,expanded ranch house that second-story,ep032
318,what you think outside not my colonial I,ep032
321,love the brick this is more of that,ep032
324,medium sized home work overall over,ep032
327,"2,100 square feet here with 3 bedrooms 3",ep032
330,full baths I love that for Meghan and I,ep032
333,live in a 900 square foot condo so,ep032
336,moving to this size house I think is a,ep032
339,great transition for us maybe in the,ep032
342,future if we want to upgrade you have,ep032
345,the chance to do that yeah it really,ep032
348,doesn't make sense to me to move into a,ep032
351,house like this just have to move in a,ep032
354,couple years you're gonna be really,ep032
357,happy with this Chris its 425,ep032
360,I love 425 that's time price this is,ep032
363,lots of room in the budget let's go,ep032
366,through the house and see what you guys,ep032
369,have this is our formal living room we,ep032
372,have a bigger family room where I put my,ep032
375,TV yeah just off the living room is a,ep032
378,step up dining area tight space is good,ep032
381,but everything would have to go yeah,ep032
384,countertops the cabinet's yeah I mean,ep032
387,this this is a big gut we can remodel it,ep032
390,ourselves but for me after being on the,ep032
393,job site all day the last thing I really,ep032
396,want to do is come home and be on,ep032
399,another job site I like the idea of,ep032
402,renovating it and making my custom,ep032
405,kitchen and I could have like pantry I,ep032
408,mean we have a budget for that,ep032
411,and with the pass-through and the,ep032
414,openness here it actually feels you know,ep032
417,like the open-concept home yeah and you,ep032
420,got space for an over here yeah maybe we,ep032
423,could create the dining room here right,ep032
426,the other space to be a home office yeah,ep032
429,that's a good idea,ep032
432,this is where Chris you could have your,ep032
435,TV set up okay I can see us hanging,ep032
438,something nice in here and this leads,ep032
441,from the kitchen out here you actually,ep032
444,go out the door right here to go outside,ep032
447,Oh No,ep032
450,up in decent size and the fence gives,ep032
453,you some privacy as well it's got,ep032
456,potential back inside they see a,ep032
459,secondary bedroom at one time there was,ep032
462,a wall right here and this was two,ep032
465,bedrooms that's interesting I can see it,ep032
468,now expanse you can create two bedrooms,ep032
471,and now have a four bedroom home I,ep032
474,definitely like the idea of four,ep032
477,bedrooms and the bathrooms right across,ep032
480,the hall nice so this is where the,ep032
483,master suite is on the main level I,ep032
486,don't know if I like that yeah that,ep032
489,bothers me a little bit too well it is a,ep032
492,great size I mean it's pretty big size,ep032
495,king bed yeah it's a really big room,ep032
498,here's the master bathroom yeah we could,ep032
501,save some money in here I mean we want,ep032
504,to do much there's no tub other one has,ep032
507,one yeah the kids bathroom yeah let's go,ep032
510,take a look at the bedroom upstairs,ep032
513,master bedroom it could be a guest room,ep032
516,yeah you're right it could yeah we don't,ep032
519,have a basement,ep032
522,no basement no garage I mean those are,ep032
525,too big it's tougher storage well this,ep032
528,room does come with its own bathroom,ep032
531,though so if you do have gas for,ep032
534,somebody up here a bathroom,ep032
537,what you got sick of the house I mean I,ep032
540,like the character brick for our commute,ep032
543,I mean this is as good as it's gonna get,ep032
546,the private fenced in backyard I think,ep032
549,is what we're both looking for and he's,ep032
552,work for sure but it's below our budget,ep032
555,I would love a garage you know I'd love,ep032
558,a basement style the house I mean I I,ep032
561,would love to see a colonial I'm looking,ep032
564,for four bedrooms I'm looking for more,ep032
567,of our forever home so I'd like to stay,ep032
570,houseboat a little bit bigger than that,ep032
573,but getting a bigger house means looking,ep032
576,farther away from DC it took us a while,ep032
579,to get out here if we had this way we'll,ep032
582,hit the cannons boom well well let's get,ep032
585,hold it when they're not house-hunting,ep032
588,newlyweds Megan and Chris love exploring,ep032
591,the historical areas around their home,ep032
594,in Washington DC's Northern Virginia,ep032
597,suburbs this looks like a pretty decent,ep032
600,colonial we should put an offer in I,ep032
603,don't know the phone is big enough for,ep032
606,"us with up to $600,000 to spend big",ep032
609,scene with their real estate agent,ep032
612,called an expanded ranch for Megan it,ep032
615,was well priced close to DC and had the,ep032
618,right amount of square footage for Chris,ep032
621,but it wasn't his colonial it needed,ep032
624,updating and Megan would prefer a much,ep032
627,larger house,ep032
630,[Music],ep032
633,so now there are a little more than an,ep032
636,hour from the city to see another option,ep032
639,it took us a while to get out here I,ep032
642,know it's a little far out here but it's,ep032
645,an incredible home well it's definitely,ep032
648,not a townhome but for single family I,ep032
651,do love the colonial yeah it's not my,ep032
654,ranch,ep032
657,there's no brick we're 3500 square feet,ep032
660,four bedrooms three and a half baths I,ep032
663,like the size I love the two-car garage,ep032
666,but what are we looking at it's 575 575,ep032
669,you're really gonna be impressed with,ep032
672,what you see for the money let's go take,ep032
675,a look all right I know the commute a,ep032
678,little bit farther forth they want to go,ep032
681,but I think with the colonial that Chris,ep032
684,was looking for and the size that Megan,ep032
687,was hoping to find this could fit the,ep032
690,bill for both of them I don't know about,ep032
693,this room this isn't the TV viewing area,ep032
696,no gosh all right good what do you guys,ep032
699,think about the dining room it looks a,ep032
702,little small I do like the chair rail,ep032
705,it's got a nice crown molding but it's,ep032
708,just it's small they see the powder room,ep032
711,then head to a home office great a space,ep032
714,for furnishings as well I have one big,ep032
717,question does the kegerator convey with,ep032
720,the house that's a good one we need to,ep032
723,ask for that and you see the hardwoods,ep032
726,continue all the way out nice into the,ep032
729,grand family room there's big enough for,ep032
732,you I think so,ep032
735,I may do the arm tests for the TV to the,ep032
738,kitchen here look at this kitchen,ep032
741,I love nice surprise behind that door,ep032
744,take a look through there oh it looks,ep032
747,like my pantry nice yeah look at the,ep032
750,size of this that's 575 yeah yeah not a,ep032
753,big fan of the cabinet so really they're,ep032
756,just builder grade see I like the,ep032
759,cabinet's I think I would have to be,ep032
762,changing them at 575 all the way out in,ep032
765,Leesburg I expected to find a house that,ep032
768,was more updated Megan seems to be fine,ep032
771,with the way the house is but when I,ep032
774,look at the house I do see some updates,ep032
777,that are needed all right look at this,ep032
780,porch this is nice this is cool,ep032
783,that's yard yeah it's a good size yard,ep032
786,it's enough privacy I mean neighbors on,ep032
789,this under still back inside they head,ep032
792,upstairs hardwood floors,ep032
795,no carpet and a great surprise to start,ep032
798,off with its head into the master,ep032
801,bedroom take a look inside double doors,ep032
804,are cool our furniture will definitely,ep032
807,fit this bedroom is bigger than our,ep032
810,condo well this is a good size yeah I,ep032
813,see the separate tub and shower that's,ep032
816,nice that mean the cabinet's are,ep032
819,original once again with Bill the grade,ep032
822,still in great shape at this price I,ep032
825,would like to see the master bathroom,ep032
828,redone we've got a nice secondary,ep032
831,bedroom for you guys here yeah this,ep032
834,could be the guest room they see two,ep032
837,more bedrooms and a full bath then head,ep032
840,to the basement whoa,ep032
843,this is space for a pool table ping pong,ep032
846,table future theater room everything you,ep032
849,guys look right behind you here you have,ep032
852,an extra room and a full bathroom nice,ep032
855,yeah that could be a player or this,ep032
858,bedroom if we needed it,ep032
861,[Applause],ep032
864,what you guys think like you love that,ep032
867,it's a colonial yeah I definitely was,ep032
870,looking for more of a branch with brick,ep032
873,on the exterior the basement is is,ep032
876,probably my favorite part of the house,ep032
879,besides a two-car garage I love my,ep032
882,kitchen got the office for years as well,ep032
885,so a little little concerned about the,ep032
888,commute,ep032
891,I'm a little concerned that we're gonna,ep032
894,have to redo the kitchen or the master,ep032
897,bathroom it's a big house yeah but I,ep032
900,think it's something we can grow into I,ep032
903,think maybe a starter home or something,ep032
906,like a townhome or something a little,ep032
909,smaller makes a little bit more sense to,ep032
912,me the idea of moving so then move again,ep032
915,and a couple of years makes no sense to,ep032
918,me I mean I'd like to see something,ep032
921,smaller closer to the bottom of our,ep032
924,budget but to get a cheaper home closer,ep032
927,to DC Meghan may have to compromise,ep032
930,there's a townhome I'm loving that sound,ep032
933,oh yeah one of us,ep032
936,[Music],ep032
939,all right make golf lesson time Chris,ep032
942,and Megan are taking time out from house,ep032
945,hunting so he can teach her to play his,ep032
948,favorite sport nice I can see why you,ep032
951,like this anytime that it's above fifty,ep032
954,degrees I love to be outside hiddens,ep032
957,Falls Oh have a really good personality,ep032
960,"working with $600,000 they've seen a",ep032
963,ranch-style home for Megan it was close,ep032
966,to DC and under budget but it was small,ep032
969,I needed updating then they saw a,ep032
972,colonial for Chris Megan liked the size,ep032
975,in the Home Office but it was farther,ep032
978,from DC and near the top of their budget,ep032
981,[Music],ep032
984,so today they're in Ashburn less than an,ep032
987,hour from DC to see another option Chris,ep032
990,I've got you out to a town house not,ep032
993,loving it,ep032
996,definitely not my ranch I've pretty much,ep032
999,figured that Jason was gonna throw a,ep032
1002,town house into the mix but we do have,ep032
1005,"3,200 square feet of living space that's",ep032
1008,four bedrooms three and a half baths,ep032
1011,okay it's listed for five hundred and,ep032
1014,fifty nine thousand nine hundred dollars,ep032
1017,"I mean high for a townhome but 3,200",ep032
1020,square feet you see why I mean two-car,ep032
1023,garage there's gotta be some good,ep032
1026,reasons let's go take a look yeah let's,ep032
1029,check it out I think this is a great,ep032
1032,compromise as far as what they're,ep032
1035,looking for sighs the price point and,ep032
1038,the proximity to work awesome entry yeah,ep032
1041,what floors are nice yeah love the,ep032
1044,hardwood through here this is where the,ep032
1047,dining room will be lots of open concept,ep032
1050,yeah this is our living space this is,ep032
1053,the family room / dining room this feels,ep032
1056,a little bit cramped me with the kitchen,ep032
1059,and we put a couch here and the,ep032
1062,television it looks like they they,ep032
1065,pre-wired,ep032
1068,for a TV so you can mount a TV above the,ep032
1071,fireplace - great call look at that view,ep032
1074,what we're looking for,ep032
1077,this is gorgeous oh yeah but your,ep032
1080,neighbors there yeah the one five five,ep032
1083,yeah they take a look at the pantry,ep032
1086,behind you guys oh yeah that's perfect,ep032
1089,yeah definitely what you've been looking,ep032
1092,for this kitchen is gorgeous,ep032
1095,I don't know change a thing about it,ep032
1098,tons of storage as well and Grandin's,ep032
1101,nice I love the dark cabinets stainless,ep032
1104,steel appliances are awesome I know you,ep032
1107,know that space may have live in tight,ep032
1110,for the TV room right but this gives you,ep032
1113,another option is here as well,ep032
1116,okay these also could be the home office,ep032
1119,area hi-c I like that idea as long as,ep032
1122,there's another place to mount a TV you,ep032
1125,can have this for your office they see a,ep032
1128,powder room then head upstairs,ep032
1131,I love these stairs they're great and we,ep032
1134,do transition the carpet up here okay,ep032
1137,and this is the master bedroom,ep032
1140,wow this is a good size this is great we,ep032
1143,could definitely fit all our stuff in,ep032
1146,here,ep032
1149,Meaghan I think you have a nice surprise,ep032
1152,in here for you yeah this is great Oh,ep032
1155,down the hall they see a full bath and,ep032
1158,two secondary bedrooms it's nice that,ep032
1161,they're at the end of the hallway kind,ep032
1164,of separate from the master next to each,ep032
1167,other yeah like two kids rooms here,ep032
1170,here's the this is great this is maybe,ep032
1173,the man cave I mean this is also down,ep032
1176,here is a full bath all right,ep032
1179,and the fourth bedroom this could be,ep032
1182,your home office as well,ep032
1185,right you think for me it's exactly what,ep032
1188,I'm looking for I'm in town who my,ep032
1191,cylinder our budget there's not really,ep032
1194,any project I love the kitchen and then,ep032
1197,you've got me my pantry,ep032
1200,yeah the commutes not bad we're,ep032
1203,definitely below budget as well,ep032
1206,we love that we're below budget I would,ep032
1209,have liked to see a bigger living space,ep032
1212,near the kitchen once again I mean this,ep032
1215,is a great first step for us just give,ep032
1218,us a size report with the four bedrooms,ep032
1221,right you're right but it's still a,ep032
1224,townhouse we had a lot to consider and,ep032
1227,since all of the houses are within their,ep032
1230,budget Megan and Chris may have to,ep032
1233,choose between a private yard the,ep032
1236,commute to DC and nabbing that fourth,ep032
1239,bedroom I know what else I'm leaning,ep032
1242,towards,ep032
1245,hey honey hey are you going here I,ep032
1248,brought you lunch,ep032
1251,newlyweds Megan and Chris have a budget,ep032
1254,"of $600,000 to spend on their first home",ep032
1257,in the Northern Virginia suburbs of,ep032
1260,Washington DC they've seen several,ep032
1263,options now it's decision time what do,ep032
1266,you think about 425 it would need a lot,ep032
1269,of renovating it needs a lot of,ep032
1272,renovation,ep032
1275,close to the city the thing I'm,ep032
1278,concerned about is no garage no basement,ep032
1281,it doesn't have the four bedrooms,ep032
1284,anyway house number two the colonial 575,ep032
1287,but it had all of the space that we're,ep032
1290,looking for,ep032
1293,it had my office on the first floor that,ep032
1296,basement was seen the commute was it was,ep032
1299,the farthest of the three yeah I mean,ep032
1302,that's something to think about how,ep032
1305,about your townhouse loved the townhouse,ep032
1308,this one's listed for 559 nine right in,ep032
1311,our budget it was a big town house and I,ep032
1314,had a gorgeous kitchen garage and I had,ep032
1317,the four bedrooms it would be a good,ep032
1320,starter home for us I feel like we,ep032
1323,really need that forever home,ep032
1326,mm-hmm so which one do you think outside,ep032
1329,of it being a townhouse it really did,ep032
1332,have all the things that we wanted so it,ep032
1335,sounds like you're willing to pick a,ep032
1338,townhouse for me well I think I'm,ep032
1341,willing to pick our forever home for you,ep032
1344,you are I think it's the colonial yeah,ep032
1347,let's do it,ep032
1350,cheers Cheers that is our home yeah,ep032
1353,can't wait for everyone to see the place,ep032
1356,we selected the colonial we put an offer,ep032
1359,in three months ago and actually just,ep032
1362,moved in three weeks ago we ended up,ep032
1365,"paying full price to 575,000 so just in",ep032
1368,this bowl right yeah it feels awesome to,ep032
1371,be in our new house it has everything we,ep032
1374,want to have my office a space for his,ep032
1377,man,ep032
1380,ideally I'd love to put a wet bar in,ep032
1383,over their pool table you know set it up,ep032
1386,for kind of a sports watching,ep032
1389,extravaganza the two-car garage is great,ep032
1392,the house is awesome this isn't my,ep032
1395,one-story ranch but really what sold it,ep032
1398,for me it was like the large kitchen I,ep032
1401,have tons of storage tons of counter,ep032
1404,space in the pantry and we got the,ep032
1407,eat-in open space to the living room,ep032
1410,plus the dining room,ep032
1413,I definitely got my colonial with this,ep032
1416,house but I compromised on the space and,ep032
1419,the commute it's a little further away,ep032
1422,than we wanted to be and it's a little,ep032
1425,bigger than we wanted or at least that I,ep032
1428,want but we'll go into it or like a more,ep032
1431,yellow like a neutral color I like the,ep032
1434,yellow so we found out that we're,ep032
1437,pregnant I'm gonna take a little longer,ep032
1440,so I guess it was good that we bought,ep032
1443,the big house kids were here we're,ep032
1446,actually having our parents over to let,ep032
1449,them know the gender of the baby,ep032
1452,so whatever balloons we hold on to you,ep032
1455,guys already this process has been very,ep032
1458,emotional partially probably because I'm,ep032
1461,hormonal I'm pregnant but also because,ep032
1464,it's just a big deal in life we're,ep032
1467,really excited,ep032
1470,1 2 3,ep032
1473,[Applause],ep032
1476,[Music],ep032
1479,[Applause],ep032
1482,[Music],ep032
1485,yeah that's definitely our forever out,ep032
12,oh wow look at this you you're right on,ep033
15,the water like this Jim is searching,ep033
18,Bradenton Florida for a loan that will,ep033
21,fulfill her and her late husband's wish,ep033
24,of raising their sons on the water the,ep033
27,boys are gonna love this I mean fishing,ep033
30,kayaking this looks beautiful but since,ep033
33,she's a single parent now who also,ep033
36,travels for work her friend thinks a low,ep033
39,maintenance condo is a wiser choice than,ep033
42,a waterfront fixer all you have to do is,ep033
45,bring your furniture and it's ready to,ep033
48,go true right still it's not my place,ep033
51,right on the water,ep033
54,well she hold out for waterfront despite,ep033
57,the headaches that might entail how much,ep033
60,you think it would be to put a pool here,ep033
63,"$50,000 I could extend the lanai out",ep033
66,here so it's of one big open,ep033
69,inside/outside space you're talking,ep033
72,about a pretty expensive project what's,ep033
75,the kitchen look like you're looking at,ep033
78,new cabinets new tile new counters new,ep033
81,appliances okay,ep033
84,[Music],ep033
87,know what not bad my name is Kim I work,ep033
90,for major university out of Boston,ep033
93,actually planning events around the,ep033
96,country I'm a single mom I have two boys,ep033
99,Jake is 13 and Maximus is seven and,ep033
102,we've been living here in Bradenton,ep033
105,Florida which is between Sarasota and,ep033
108,Tampa for about 13 years,ep033
111,okay little further there okay when I,ep033
114,first moved from Boston to Bradington it,ep033
117,was a culture shock and I always thought,ep033
120,I was gonna go back to the Northeast but,ep033
123,I realized down here it's such a great,ep033
126,town there's so many people from all,ep033
129,over it's it's growing but there's a,ep033
132,hometown feeling people really care,ep033
135,about you I love the fact that it's by,ep033
138,the water I just feel like this is the,ep033
141,place to call home my husband and I,ep033
144,about five years ago built this home,ep033
147,here Mike and I really planned it so,ep033
150,that we could raise our boys here but,ep033
153,about three years ago Mike suddenly,ep033
156,passed away it's just kind of changed my,ep033
159,trajectory in life and I feel like the,ep033
162,boys and I have done a really good job,ep033
165,adapting and just kind of moving forward,ep033
168,as much as I love this house right now,ep033
171,it's just time to start new a little bit,ep033
174,there's a lot of memories here good and,ep033
177,bad and so I've decided to sell this,ep033
180,house and move closer to the boys school,ep033
183,and the move would put Kim right by her,ep033
186,in-laws who help take care of the boys,ep033
189,when she travels for work once I made,ep033
192,the decision that it was you know time,ep033
195,to look for a new house I immediately,ep033
198,called Jean and Laura so we should get a,ep033
201,boat and all go out that would be,ep033
204,awesome,ep033
207,Laura and Jean have gone above and,ep033
210,beyond in their friendship and from,ep033
213,moment Mike passed until now they've,ep033
216,just been right by my side,ep033
219,she's just been an amazing person in my,ep033
222,life and her husband happens to be a,ep033
225,realtor which is perfect you design your,ep033
228,own home what would it happen I could,ep033
231,have whatever I wanted number one if I,ep033
234,could find something on the water that,ep033
237,has always been my dream,ep033
240,Mike and I always had the dream of,ep033
243,living on the water but now I feel like,ep033
246,it's but my dream to I really want to,ep033
249,make this happen especially for the boys,ep033
252,because they love to kayak and fish and,ep033
255,swim working with a budget of 650,ep033
258,thousand dollars Kim is hoping to find a,ep033
261,3-bed 2bath house along one of the,ep033
264,man-made canals that lead to the Gulf of,ep033
267,Mexico the inventory is kind of love for,ep033
270,waterfront property in that price range,ep033
273,okay,ep033
276,are you willing to do a fixer-upper I,ep033
279,could entertain that I've never done the,ep033
282,renovation I don't really know what I'm,ep033
285,getting myself into but I don't know,ep033
288,something about renovating and getting,ep033
291,what I want I'm kind of excited to do I,ep033
294,don't know if fixer-upper is the right,ep033
297,way to go you know what our renovation,ep033
300,was like I'd hate to see Kim have to,ep033
303,live with that kind of a headache I'd,ep033
306,like to see her get into some new,ep033
309,construction something that's move-in,ep033
312,ready I'm more concerned about what's,ep033
315,gonna be a good fit for Kim's lifestyle,ep033
318,as a busy working mom I was right about,ep033
321,condo at all I think it could be a great,ep033
324,fit when she's traveling it would be,ep033
327,great to be able to call the maintenance,ep033
330,person and have anything that needs to,ep033
333,be addressed addressed but Kim would,ep033
336,rather have a single-family house in,ep033
339,South West Florida there's a lot of,ep033
342,small quaint kind of beach bungalow,ep033
345,homes that you know I really like just,ep033
348,one floor simple kind of cozy what kind,ep033
351,of floor plan you're thinking open floor,ep033
354,plan would be great with an island in,ep033
357,the kitchen I'm hoping that in my new,ep033
360,house that I can have a nice granite,ep033
363,like I have in this house and then I,ep033
366,like the darker cabinets I think coming,ep033
369,from the Northeast I still have that,ep033
372,rich the woods and stuff I personally do,ep033
375,like the white cabinets,ep033
378,they are definitely very in I would like,ep033
381,to have the outside lanai,ep033
384,the pool for the boys so that they can,ep033
387,you know go in and out like they do now,ep033
390,and really look I have now the pocket,ep033
393,sliders like indoor/outdoor living,ep033
396,[Music],ep033
399,I've never purchased a home by myself,ep033
402,before Mike and I made all those big,ep033
405,life changes together so this is scary,ep033
408,to me but I'm also really excited to,ep033
411,start this new chapter the right things,ep033
414,are gonna fall in place I can just feel,ep033
417,it first up a house right on the water,ep033
420,it was built in 1968 by a famous builder,ep033
423,"Ruth Richmond who built about 13,000",ep033
426,homes in Sarasota and manatee it's a,ep033
429,little rough around the edges need some,ep033
432,work I'm looking at that I know gene are,ep033
435,you sure about this it looks like it,ep033
438,needs more than a little work and that's,ep033
441,not a charming bungalow yeah it needs,ep033
444,some work there's no doubt but I see a,ep033
447,lot of potential here it's a two-bedroom,ep033
450,three-bath home there's not a third,ep033
453,bedroom though yet and not yet there's,ep033
456,some extra rooms that I think could be,ep033
459,converted into a third bedroom what are,ep033
462,"they asking for 400,000 and I think",ep033
465,"you're gonna need to put 150 to 200,000",ep033
468,into it to make it exactly what you want,ep033
471,it to be,ep033
474,"although 400,000 may seem like a low",ep033
477,price for our waterfront property it,ep033
480,"could be that 200,000 isn't nearly",ep033
483,enough to fix it up it's open space it's,ep033
486,not as bad inside as I thought it would,ep033
489,be you said you wanted an open floor,ep033
492,plan this is an open floor plan even,ep033
495,though it's an older home this,ep033
498,particular builder built higher ceilings,ep033
501,she also did the terrazzo floors kind of,ep033
504,like this this look of this if you I,ep033
507,mean you'd have to fix it up a lot and,ep033
510,these clean up really nicely,ep033
513,what's the kitchen look like yeah okay,ep033
516,so we have some some work to do in here,ep033
519,as well so small I would almost see this,ep033
522,wall coming down completely if you can,ep033
525,you're looking at new cabinets new tile,ep033
528,new counters new appliances so I think,ep033
531,you're looking at one of the most,ep033
534,expensive parts of the project okay just,ep033
537,remember round,ep033
540,I'm okay open to fixer-upper but I'm,ep033
543,looking at this and I'm thinking what am,ep033
546,I getting myself into it oh wow it's,ep033
549,right on the water the waters beautiful,ep033
552,"I love it we also have a 10,000 pound",ep033
555,boat lift okay,ep033
558,and the screened-in pool the boys are,ep033
561,gonna love this I mean fishing kayaking,ep033
564,this is beautiful I see this like,ep033
567,screened all in I could extend the lanai,ep033
570,out here so it's like one big open,ep033
573,inside-outside space I get rid of those,ep033
576,windows actually put sliders you're,ep033
579,talking about a pretty expensive project,ep033
582,my experience has been with waterfront,ep033
585,homes they always retain their value she,ep033
588,would get dollar for dollar return on,ep033
591,any money she spends upgrading this is,ep033
594,nice not a huge pool but it's a good,ep033
597,size you know tell you what it would,ep033
600,probably cost sixty or seventy thousand,ep033
603,dollars to put a pool really okay fixing,ep033
606,it will be a lot less expensive they go,ep033
609,back inside to look at the enclosed,ep033
612,patio den and a bathroom this thing,ep033
615,could be made into a third bedroom for,ep033
618,4j,ep033
621,yeah it's kind of small I don't know if,ep033
624,Jake's gonna go for this it's small but,ep033
627,I mean when you're living on the water,ep033
630,all you're gonna do is sleep in here,ep033
633,they passed by a bedroom and bathroom,ep033
636,before heading to the master suite this,ep033
639,is the master my furniture won't even,ep033
642,fit in here from my current bedroom,ep033
645,where would I put my clothes where's the,ep033
648,closet it's some space in the master,ep033
651,bathroom that I think can be,ep033
654,incorporated into a walk-in closet,ep033
657,let me put them clothes at your house my,ep033
660,idea is to lose this tub and use this,ep033
663,space as your walk-in closet just so,ep033
666,small to me it's small it needs a lot of,ep033
669,work I'd say every part of this bathroom,ep033
672,would need work but I like the fact that,ep033
675,it's still close to the water and it has,ep033
678,the pool you wanted also have the open,ep033
681,space there's extra three bathrooms but,ep033
684,it just seems like there's just so much,ep033
687,to be done,ep033
690,all house needs work I'm concerned about,ep033
693,you taking on this kind of project at,ep033
696,this stage in your life I think that we,ep033
699,ought to look at something newer that's,ep033
702,move-in-ready I think we could find,ep033
705,something to see the next place is,ep033
708,brand-new and a bit of a stretch for Kim,ep033
711,at the condo kind of worried about that,ep033
714,you know I didn't really want a condo I,ep033
717,think you should keep an open mind,ep033
720,[Applause],ep033
723,so Jake I just want to remind you that,ep033
726,Gigi's gonna pick you up after school,ep033
729,busy working mom Kim is searching,ep033
732,Bradenton Florida for a waterfront,ep033
735,bungalow to share with her two sons to,ep033
738,"stay within her 650,000 dollar budget",ep033
741,and beyond the water,ep033
744,Kim is willing to take on a fixer but,ep033
747,close friend Lara think skin would be,ep033
750,better off simplifying her life by,ep033
753,getting a brand-new condo so far,ep033
756,Lara's husband Jean a real-estate agent,ep033
759,has shown them a dated waterfront home,ep033
762,with a pool it was well below her budget,ep033
765,but Lara was concerned that it needed,ep033
768,too much work okay today Kim we're gonna,ep033
771,look at a new condominium it's a Key,ep033
774,West style condominium complex,ep033
777,it's not my vintage bungalow that I,ep033
780,really want on the beach on the by the,ep033
783,water but um the colors are nice does,ep033
786,give me that beachy feel still that I'm,ep033
789,going forward but at the condo kind of,ep033
792,worried about that you know I didn't,ep033
795,really want a condo I want you to keep,ep033
798,an open mind it's a different type of,ep033
801,lifestyle than the single-family home,ep033
804,but it's a lot less to manage that is,ep033
807,true she does travel a lot on business,ep033
810,there's maintenance on site and this,ep033
813,would be a really really good,ep033
816,opportunity for her to live that,ep033
819,carefree lifestyle okay today we're,ep033
822,gonna look at a three bed two and a half,ep033
825,bath model and if you select one with a,ep033
828,bay view they started four hundred and,ep033
831,seventy five thousand dollars,ep033
834,oh wow it feels like a house it doesn't,ep033
837,really feel like a condom I would say I,ep033
840,love the colors this is it's definitely,ep033
843,my style I like that it all flows it,ep033
846,kinda reminds me of my house now,ep033
849,everything's open and it's something,ep033
852,like this pack up your furniture and,ep033
855,it's move-in ready I don't know not on,ep033
858,the water they have the unit overlooking,ep033
861,the bay to me that there's a different,ep033
864,still you know it's kind of like to be,ep033
867,on the water is just a dream I've had,ep033
870,for many many years,ep033
873,oh wow look at the full lure right there,ep033
876,Oh lovely,ep033
879,with the 406 dollar a month you get,ep033
882,resort style amenities heated pool the,ep033
885,wet bar with flat-screen TV inside the,ep033
888,clubhouse there's a billiard room is a,ep033
891,fitness center other amenities are the,ep033
894,canoe and kayak launch it's a lot but,ep033
897,still ok next row like would you say 400,ep033
900,a month it's still a lot every month one,ep033
903,of the great things about this area is,ep033
906,that you have someone to look out for,ep033
909,your property true I like the breakfast,ep033
912,bar just seems small to me and the white,ep033
915,cabinets I hate white cabinets it's just,ep033
918,not it's not New England you know I like,ep033
921,the Northeast stuff jeans sure right but,ep033
924,the white cabinets are really in right,ep033
927,now I don't like just not my taste at,ep033
930,all but it's functional well why don't,ep033
933,we take a look at one of the bedrooms,ep033
936,okay okay and this is a separate wing,ep033
939,which I think will be great for Jake,ep033
942,it's got a separate bathroom nice that a,ep033
945,private bedroom this works I like it's,ep033
948,nice that's nice yeah see the bedroom,ep033
951,it's kind of large I think he'd like it,ep033
954,yeah they take a peek at a half bath and,ep033
957,bedroom it's a good-size room,ep033
960,to the left is the master bedroom oh wow,ep033
963,look at this,ep033
966,this is the master used to you know it,ep033
969,looks like kind of like my bedroom now,ep033
972,in this room also has an outdoor balcony,ep033
975,I mean we're so used to being outside at,ep033
978,my house and the boys are outside all,ep033
981,the time it just there's not a lot of,ep033
984,outside space here for that well you,ep033
987,have the common area the pool yeah but I,ep033
990,can't you know watch them but this is,ep033
993,gorgeous I do like this a lot,ep033

1011,master bedroom and bath for just,ep033
1014,unbelievable there's a pool outside,ep033
1017,there's a lot of plusses here you know,ep033
1020,kayaks and everything but I just want to,ep033
1023,be on the water I don't know what do you,ep033
1026,think want you to consider all the,ep033
1029,advantages of new construction I mean,ep033
1032,this is moving ready and when you're,ep033
1035,away everything would be cared for by a,ep033
1038,property manager that could be a huge,ep033
1041,advantage for you,ep033
1044,I appreciate that Laura's looking out,ep033
1047,for me and trying so hard to make my,ep033
1050,life simpler and you know this is,ep033
1053,brand-new construction and it's,ep033
1056,beautiful but my heart's been set on a,ep033
1059,house if I can get on the water I just,ep033
1062,for hurt Jeanne has managed to find a,ep033
1065,waterfront bungalow that's been updated,ep033
1068,still nothing is perfect a little bit,ep033
1071,more things yes yeah a little more than,ep033
1074,I want to spend,ep033
1077,[Music],ep033
1080,yeah help me out kiddo the single mom,ep033
1083,Kim wants to fulfill a dream of buying a,ep033
1086,waterfront bungalow in Bradenton Florida,ep033
1089,but in her 650 thousand dollar price,ep033
1092,range finding a place that also has the,ep033
1095,upgrades she's used to and a swimming,ep033
1098,pool has been a challenge with the help,ep033
1101,of her friends Lara and Jean who's also,ep033
1104,Kim's agent they've seen two very,ep033
1107,different homes a waterfront house with,ep033
1110,a pool that needs a lot of work and a,ep033
1113,brand new condo that's not right on the,ep033
1116,water,ep033
1119,so now jean has lined up an updated,ep033
1122,single-family house on the water I,ep033
1125,thought this was a little more of that,ep033
1128,beach bungalow look and feel that you,ep033
1131,were hoping for,ep033
1134,absolutely I like the color I like the,ep033
1137,colors are great first impression I love,ep033
1140,it so far very good,ep033
1143,all right so this is a 3-bed 2bath 1645,ep033
1146,square-foot home and it's 675 thousand,ep033
1149,dollars,ep033
1152,nice yeah a little more than I want to,ep033
1155,spend it has been completely remodeled,ep033
1158,it is move-in ready it's been on the,ep033
1161,market for a long time yeah and I think,ep033
1164,there may be some room to negotiate okay,ep033
1167,it's worth a look right,ep033
1170,Wow this is nice,ep033
1173,I like this I like that it's like one,ep033
1176,open area but Kim wanted the higher,ep033
1179,ceilings right yeah it does seem a,ep033
1182,little kind of small small space and low,ep033
1185,ceilings the older homes tend to have a,ep033
1188,lower ceiling you know when you get a,ep033
1191,house on the water again you're gonna,ep033
1194,have to make some compromises yeah look,ep033
1197,at the kitchen this kitchens nice this,ep033
1200,granite that's beautiful,ep033
1203,a lot of contemporary feels in here I,ep033
1206,like the modern sink and industrial,ep033
1209,faucet I mean they don't have an island,ep033
1212,I kind of like an island but this is a,ep033
1215,lot of counter space yeah plenty of room,ep033
1218,to entertain I don't know though I don't,ep033
1221,like this antique white kind of thing,ep033
1224,but they're brand-new,ep033
1227,Kessie the outside just kick a little,ep033
1230,through you oh wow look at this view,ep033
1233,you're right on the water I like this oh,ep033
1236,it's beautiful gorgeous the bar is,ep033
1239,beautiful that deck looks brand-new,ep033
1242,yeah this is neat you got a covered area,ep033
1245,it's screened in you've got an open area,ep033
1248,look at the covered boat dock - that's,ep033
1251,really neat - to have been a little bit,ep033
1254,of a yard back here to play I like that,ep033
1257,I don't see your pool though oh I know,ep033
1260,how much do you think it would be though,ep033
1263,to put a pool here conservative estimate,ep033
1266,"$50,000 it might even be more since this",ep033
1269,is on the water and it doesn't look like,ep033
1272,it would be very easy to bring equipment,ep033
1275,in you might even have to bring it in on,ep033
1278,a barge but the boys would so want a,ep033
1281,pool you know so but this is so clean,ep033
1284,and ready to be lived in now maybe they,ep033
1287,could get used to swimming right off the,ep033
1290,dock true they go back inside to look at,ep033
1293,two bedrooms another water view bedroom,ep033
1296,that's nice and a bath before heading to,ep033
1299,the master suite it's nice but it feels,ep033
1302,small and the carpet I'm not a big,ep033
1305,carpet fan we could always fix that,ep033
1308,that's easy,ep033
1311,oh I don't even get the water view the,ep033
1314,boys get the water view I get the front,ep033
1317,yard no I know that's you know about the,ep033
1320,bathroom there's no door there yeah,ep033
1323,could you get a door fee down there it,ep033
1326,looks like it's too small that seems,ep033
1329,weird I'm sure you could do something,ep033
1332,you know although there are some,ep033
1335,compromises to this home in the end you,ep033
1338,get a really nice house that is on the,ep033
1341,water,ep033
1344,oh I know the master suite is not ideal,ep033
1347,but overall this is a really nice house,ep033
1350,it is I loved when we pulled up the curb,ep033
1353,appeal it's my little beach bungalow,ep033
1356,it's on the water I mean the new tile,ep033
1359,floors the plantation shutters granite,ep033
1362,countertops you can tell they put some,ep033
1365,thought into this house the upgrades are,ep033
1368,so impressive and its pristine I think,ep033
1371,the master bedroom I'm really thinking,ep033
1374,about like the no doors in the bathroom,ep033
1377,and it's small but I mean you can't,ep033
1380,really expand that room that is small,ep033
1383,the outdoor living space aside from,ep033
1386,there being a pool is absolutely,ep033
1389,beautiful it is it is but the boys,ep033
1392,really want a pool to put a pool in and,ep033
1395,I'm thinking about the cost and,ep033
1398,everything I'm already over my price,ep033
1401,range well the house has been on the,ep033
1404,market for about six months so there may,ep033
1407,be some flexibility in this price you've,ep033
1410,always put in a lower offer that's true,ep033
1413,making a decision won't be easy for Kim,ep033
1416,she'll have to choose between fixing up,ep033
1419,a waterfront house to be exactly what,ep033
1422,she wants or simplifying her life with,ep033
1425,an upgraded home I don't know they all,ep033
1428,look good what would you guys do,ep033
1431,[Music],ep033
1434,Kim wants to start a new chapter in her,ep033
1437,life by buying a new home in Bradenton,ep033
1440,Florida having looked at several options,ep033
1443,with close friends Lara and Jean who's,ep033
1446,also her agent she's ready to make a,ep033
1449,decision let's talk about that,ep033
1452,"waterfront fixer-upper for 400,000 I",ep033
1455,loved that it was on the water that I,ep033
1458,had a pool I just see a lot of a lot of,ep033
1461,potential for that has anything make all,ep033
1464,the selections yourself you're not,ep033
1467,paying for somebody else's choices it,ep033
1470,definitely is the lowest price but there,ep033
1473,is a lot of work to be done there it's,ep033
1476,not a 3-bedroom so that's gonna be a,ep033
1479,major part of the construction project,ep033
1482,you'll be taking on you're right you're,ep033
1485,right I've never remodeled the house,ep033
1488,before so I don't know what I'm getting,ep033
1491,myself into well let's talk about the,ep033
1494,new construction in condo for 475 wasn't,ep033
1497,on the water but it was pretty close it,ep033
1500,is turnkey and the quality of the,ep033
1503,construction is really excellent there,ep033
1506,is something to that that I have to,ep033
1509,worry about it and maintenance and,ep033
1512,upkeep I did like the master bedroom and,ep033
1515,it did feel like a house even though,ep033
1518,it's it was a condo great amenities for,ep033
1521,the boys to enjoy right the pool and the,ep033
1524,kayaking they have the two balconies,ep033
1527,there which were nice but they just,ep033
1530,weren't really large balconies not quite,ep033
1533,the same as al in an outdoor living,ep033
1536,space where you can sit down and enjoy,ep033
1539,it yeah yeah so let's talk about the,ep033
1542,waterfront remodeled home for 675,ep033
1545,thousand just over the price makes me,ep033
1548,nervous but I have to say when we pulled,ep033
1551,up that was the best curb appeal it is,ep033
1554,completely move-in ready the kitchen was,ep033
1557,beautiful the floors were beautiful the,ep033
1560,outdoor living space was immaculate it,ep033
1563,was beautifully done but there's not a,ep033
1566,fool also they really did a great job,ep033
1569,with the kitchen but it's not my taste,ep033
1572,the master bedroom that's the least,ep033
1575,favorite to me I mean there wasn't a,ep033
1578,door on the bathroom and the ceilings,ep033
1581,were kind of low there it is over my,ep033
1584,price range ah so it has been on the,ep033
1587,market for a while and they may,ep033
1590,entertain a lower offer I don't know,ep033
1593,they all look good what would you guys,ep033
1596,do,ep033
1599,I know that I've been persuading you to,ep033
1602,consider the move-in ready and new,ep033
1605,construction all along but to be,ep033
1608,waterfront for the price of the,ep033
1611,fixer-upper that's a great find you know,ep033
1614,I think it's something about the back in,ep033
1617,the view I know there's so much I have,ep033
1620,to do which I feel like I'm crazy to,ep033
1623,thinking how am I gonna manage all that,ep033
1626,but you know they would say your gut is,ep033
1629,your second brain it keeps telling me,ep033
1632,that's what I want to do then let's go,ep033
1635,for it I think we can negotiate a really,ep033
1638,good price let's do it I think if we can,ep033
1641,take this wall down here you know this,ep033
1644,is where we could put the island and,ep033
1647,gene first showed me this house you know,ep033
1650,my dream house on the water really,ep033
1653,wasn't what I thought it was gonna be,ep033
1656,but I think with some work I think it's,ep033
1659,gonna be something I'm just gonna truly,ep033
1662,love and the boys will be so happy here,ep033
1665,but maybe this can be the master suite,ep033
1668,Oh perfect and this would be the walk-in,ep033
1671,closet look how big this her foot she,ep033
1674,was all my clothes Jean was amazing he,ep033
1677,did such a great job helping me,ep033
1680,negotiate this house the seller wanted,ep033
1683,it for 400 thousand and we settled on,ep033
1686,325 thousand I just feel like for the,ep033
1689,price that I bought this at for what I,ep033
1692,need to put into it I can't go wrong,ep033
1695,three two one go what's great about this,ep033
1698,house is I think I'm gonna really get,ep033
1701,kind of my must-haves that I've been,ep033
1704,talking about my slider pocket doors the,ep033
1707,lanai that's open and my island in the,ep033
1710,kitchen and darker cabinets and I think,ep033
1713,we'll bring the kayaks out here what do,ep033
1716,you think max I'll get a boat first you,ep033
1719,want to get a boat first yeah this house,ep033
1722,is kind of like a metaphor I'm,ep033
1725,transforming it kind of like the boy is,ep033
1728,dying right now for transforming our,ep033
1731,lives when life changes so suddenly you,ep033
1734,lose a spouse you're so vulnerable and,ep033
1737,you really doubt yourself on everything,ep033
1740,and I just felt like when I walked into,ep033
1743,this house this was a good decision it,ep033
1746,gives me a lot of confidence that I did,ep033
1749,this and I'm gonna provide this for my,ep033
1752,boys and hopefully you know my,ep033
1755,grandchildren might come here someday,ep033
1758,and play,ep033
12,Wow oh wow its colonial it's not my,ep034
15,style,ep034
18,we'll see for Buffalo New York couple,ep034
21,Ryan and Misha finding a first home that,ep034
24,they can agree on isn't exactly a walk,ep034
27,in the park this is what you call a,ep034
30,kitchen I love the appliances in here,ep034
33,they're so beautiful,ep034
36,it's that carpet there I like it that,ep034
39,Paige cut it kind of looks like poop,ep034
42,color too to make it work,ep034
45,they'll have to find some common ground,ep034
48,nice we've done I'll be in the hot tub,ep034

90,great place to live and the people are,ep034
93,friendly wait for me to get back city in,ep034
96,the face we met in the most traditional,ep034
99,way we met online we both didn't think,ep034
102,that we would ever go online and meet,ep034
105,someone but it happened at the time,ep034
108,Nisha who's originally from Sri Lanka,ep034
111,was completing her residency and Ryan,ep034
114,was starting his business we had a busy,ep034

129,on my car let's just leave it at that,ep034
132,gotta keep your eye on that Paul we've,ep034

147,think like she thinks I'm funny which is,ep034
150,the greatest thing in the world cuz I'm,ep034
153,really not that funny so watch me from,ep034
156,over here okay she makes a bad day a,ep034
159,good day when she smiles and I cook for,ep034
162,you well that's the biggest part she's,ep034
165,amazing cook the best Indian food you'll,ep034
168,ever have - smell these spices and tell,ep034
171,me what you think it is what is this one,ep034
174,[Music],ep034
177,now that Nisha's finished school and,ep034
180,Ryan's business is off the ground,ep034
183,they're looking to upgrade in a big way,ep034
186,we currently live in a townhouse it's,ep034
189,very small it's about a thousand square,ep034
192,feet it was fine for me as a bachelor,ep034
195,but when we're tripping over each other,ep034
198,trying to cook dinner it it just it's,ep034
201,too much I have a very big family and,ep034
204,when they come around which is very,ep034
207,often they just can't you know there's,ep034
210,not enough room for them to sleep or,ep034
213,play around you know for the kids,ep034
216,this coriander,ep034
219,our budget is 400 to 450 thousand and I,ep034
222,want it to be on the lower end of that,ep034
225,that's bathroom if possible and can you,ep034
228,finish all that so what are your,ep034
231,must-haves for us any place well of,ep034
234,course you know I have a big list,ep034
237,I love the colonial style of houses I,ep034
240,just like to drive up the curb appeal,ep034
243,for me I prefer contemporary houses,ep034
246,especially inside because I like the,ep034
249,sleek clean open concept with lot of,ep034
252,Lighting's inside the house I know I,ep034
255,would be shown this one you guys,ep034
258,definitely need like more bedrooms we,ep034
261,definitely are looking for four bedrooms,ep034
264,so that our family can stay over one of,ep034
267,my key things is I want to I want to,ep034
270,finish basement and it's just a place to,ep034
273,go and get away from it all my own,ep034
276,little sanctuary if you will well of,ep034
279,course I want the big kitchen that I,ep034
282,always wanted with the big island and a,ep034
285,lot of you know space before over all,ep034
288,this equipment beyond so yeah I want to,ep034
291,have a backyard because we're private,ep034
294,people right you want to have a fence so,ep034
297,the neighbors can't come over and I,ep034
300,really love that any like things that,ep034
303,should be on like big no no's I've got,ep034
306,this thing about carpet in the bedroom,ep034
309,oh yeah I am so against carpet I just,ep034
312,don't feel like it's clean I love carpet,ep034
315,in the bedroom you wake up in the,ep034
318,morning you don't want to put your feet,ep034
321,down on a cold floor and since anisha's,ep034
324,family visits a lot her mom has a,ep034
327,must-have of her own the only request,ep034
330,that my mom has is of course the front,ep034
333,main door should not be south we don't,ep034
336,really know why it's kind of like what,ep034
339,specialty about Romans and like being,ep034
342,more auspicious and all that stuff it's,ep034
345,hard for the real estate agents to put,ep034
348,in a search,ep034
351,facing south I think this new house is,ep034
354,gonna represent us this will pretty much,ep034
357,be the catalyst to the rest of our lives,ep034
360,they all look nice this is it right here,ep034
363,really oh nice it's also a,ep034
366,colonial-style it's not my style,ep034
369,we'll see what do you think the,ep034
372,direction of the front door I think,ep034
375,driving here it seems like it would have,ep034
378,been north the way we pulled in that's a,ep034
381,good thing,ep034
384,eh Michelle it's got that two-story,ep034
387,foyer so this house is four bedroom two,ep034
390,and a half baths and the list price is,ep034
393,"450,000 that's at the top of our budget",ep034
396,it is in this room it could be a,ep034
399,first-floor bedroom it could also be an,ep034
402,office yeah I think we would go with an,ep034
405,office yeah we would probably get rid of,ep034
408,this wallpaper holy smokes so we'll come,ep034
411,in here through the kitchen this is a,ep034
414,half bathroom okay and then carries to,ep034
417,kitchen yeah Ryan this is what you call,ep034
420,a kitchen I love this two-tone,ep034
423,countertops as well as the cabinet's so,ep034
426,modern I think I love this kitchen huh,ep034
429,it's really beautiful I love the view I,ep034
432,can see myself cooking here and like you,ep034
435,know watching Ryan or my family it's not,ep034
438,as private as I wanted but it does have,ep034
441,a fence along the side backyard there,ep034
444,obviously the refrigerator goes there I,ep034
447,love the appliances in here they're so,ep034
450,beautiful and then near your family room,ep034
453,yeah carpet that was what I was gonna,ep034
456,say it it's carpet which I don't like,ep034
459,right they pass through the kitchen to a,ep034
462,formal dining room,ep034
465,do you like the columns I do but what,ep034
468,color is that it's that it's gold yeah,ep034
471,you do like gold but kind of looks like,ep034
474,color - I don't know Michel I still hate,ep034
477,this carpet I know okay so this house is,ep034
480,stood as a four-bedroom house but they,ep034
483,took one of the bedrooms and made it,ep034
486,into a laundry room which is right here,ep034
489,that's not a good thing because you know,ep034
492,we had family is here and is my mom so,ep034
495,in here is the master carpet mr. carpet,ep034
498,yes my feet will be nice and warm when I,ep034
501,wake OC right when you get out of bed,ep034
504,Jordan it's nice and soft we'll go with,ep034
507,that so the master does have a bathroom,ep034
510,off of it really nice,ep034
513,to see if it fits you may get lost in,ep034
516,the moment they see a full bath and two,ep034
519,more again,ep034
522,so here basement however is not finished,ep034
525,be really tough to finish it we just had,ep034
528,to do it not going to have that,ep034
531,sanctuary that I wanted to get away from,ep034
534,things was a colonial house which was,ep034
537,not you know on my list I like it,ep034
540,you know the curb appeal is amazing my,ep034
543,god of course there are a lot of carpets,ep034
546,which I know like I like that about the,ep034
549,biggest thing for me I think was the for,ep034
552,betcha,ep034
555,there but me,ep034
558,you put some carpet in and get rid of,ep034
561,the laundry thing hardwood carpets and,ep034
564,you know also I'd like to see maybe,ep034
567,fenced-in yard if possible so their,ep034
570,agent has lined up a true 4-bedroom,ep034
573,house with a fully fenced in yard but by,ep034
576,the way Michelle yes,ep034
579,direction is the door facing I'm,ep034
582,guessing so oh it's pretty nice yeah hey,ep034
585,Michelle how are you good how are you,ep034
588,good,ep034
591,so this is a brick colonial center,ep034
594,entrance I like that on over an acre oh,ep034
597,wow so it's quite a bit of space yeah,ep034
600,and a fenced yard oh that's exactly what,ep034
603,we needed this house is listed for 449,ep034
606,okay four bedrooms two and a half baths,ep034
609,that's a big house by the way Michelle,ep034
612,which direction is the door facing I'm,ep034
615,guessing South South a little sound,ep034
618,great a direction but yeah I'm thinking,ep034
621,so for you I do like it though the one,ep034
624,thing I don't like though it's a little,ep034
627,tight when you walk in the door I've got,ep034
630,this staircase like right in front of,ep034
633,you the first thing that goes into my,ep034
636,mind it's very outdated there's a lot of,ep034
639,work including the stairs to the floor,ep034
642,they all need to be updated so the,ep034
645,formal living room oh uh which is a,ep034
648,nice-sized room,ep034
651,decent size so formal dining room there,ep034
654,are a lot of nice details,ep034
657,I like this textured wall I do like the,ep034
660,chandelier coming down with the pendant,ep034
663,and that's a great view too that's a,ep034
666,bonus like a pool yeah I can definitely,ep034
669,see ourselves like eating here,ep034
672,entertaining our families and friends,ep034
675,pretty big kitchen open concept it is,ep034
678,big the backsplash it's gotta go I,ep034
681,consider this house a cosmetic fixer it,ep034
684,is just very outdated and I know my wife,ep034
687,does not like that off the kitchen is,ep034
690,the stairway to the basement wow this is,ep034
693,huge it's huge but definitely it's not,ep034
696,finished yeah but this one this is,ep034
699,finishable next they head upstairs to,ep034
702,see the backyard this is amazing this is,ep034
705,a really big backyard it is it's very,ep034
708,private it's just surrounded by trees,ep034
711,it's a great deck we can definitely,ep034
714,entertain different yeah let's see the,ep034
717,family room sure here's the carpet yeah,ep034
720,love it I'm not liking it I like the,ep034
723,openness of it it's not a very big room,ep034
726,but it feels bigger than it actually is,ep034
729,so that's perfect oh there's more carpet,ep034
732,here we definitely have to change now we,ep034
735,can keep the carpet the carpets fine I,ep034
738,feel like they're hallways very narrow,ep034
741,like a hotel almost so this is one nice,ep034
744,sized bedroom down here guest bedroom,ep034
747,maybe they see two more guest bedrooms,ep034
750,and head toward the front of the house,ep034
753,narrow hallway again although does it,ep034
756,open up here is that carpet there that,ep034
759,is carpet there I mean I really like,ep034
762,carpet but that's a little yeah,ep034
765,ridiculous I'm gonna vacuum right and,ep034
768,that's going to be the master this is,ep034
771,the master yes decent size it's not huge,ep034
774,they're his and hers no there's one,ep034
777,closet okay one walk-in closet but it's,ep034
780,pretty good-sized and then the master,ep034
783,bath,ep034
786,okay all right this is a little cramped,ep034
789,here I'm not liking the tiles here but,ep034
792,is this quartz or this is marble okay,ep034
795,beautiful color,ep034
798,it's like contemporary this contemporary,ep034
801,which I really like and then you have a,ep034
804,little bonus in here with the bidet hey,ep034
807,they say yep a day makes your day so,ep034
810,[Music],ep034
813,it's colonial what Ryan likes driving up,ep034
816,the curb appeal is fantastic love the,ep034
819,backyard the pool this has really nice,ep034
822,privacy has natural borders with the,ep034
825,woods yes but you know one of the big,ep034
828,important thing is the door front door,ep034
831,you know I definitely do not want the,ep034
834,door facing south the basements,ep034
837,finishable there's a lot of things that,ep034
840,we do definitely need to fix a lot of,ep034
843,renovations then you know it adds to our,ep034
846,cause so Michelle's found them a more,ep034
849,move-in-ready home but there's always a,ep034
852,catch what's a skew this is four hundred,ep034
855,fifty four thousand shell,ep034
858,[Music],ep034
861,as the hotcake yeah it's gonna be very,ep034
864,yeah,ep034
867,don't burn your eyes I think I just did,ep034
870,having outgrown their one bedroom,ep034
873,townhouse Buffalo New York couple Ryan,ep034
876,and Nisha are eager to purchase their,ep034
879,first home together,ep034
882,Ryan loved the curb appeal of a brick,ep034
885,colonial that was within their four,ep034
888,hundred and fifty thousand dollar budget,ep034
891,Anisha was a big fan of the gourmet,ep034
894,kitchen and the attractive backyard but,ep034
897,the fourth bedroom is currently being,ep034
900,used as a laundry room and the yard,ep034
903,isn't totally private,ep034
906,then they saw another colonial this one,ep034
909,had a conventional fourth bedroom and a,ep034
912,massive private lawn but the kitchen is,ep034
915,dated the basement needs to be finished,ep034
918,and the house has few contemporary,ep034
921,features for Nisha,ep034
924,don't let the tree onto here there are a,ep034
927,lot of big trees here there's Michelle,ep034
930,this is about three quarters of an acre,ep034
933,it's listed as a colonial but it does,ep034
936,have a bit of a contemporary feel,ep034
939,because of that plane Eileen or though,ep034
942,that's okay so just asking this is four,ep034
945,hundred fifty four thousand Michelle I,ep034
948,guess over our budget,ep034
951,yeah it is but it's four bedrooms and,ep034
954,four and a half bathroom okay this house,ep034
957,faces directly north okay okay so just,ep034
960,yes north yeah right I like that,ep034
963,let's see if it has the wow factor no,ep034
966,downpour I definitely love the blue door,ep034
969,oh wow you know from outside it looks,ep034
972,like a small plain white with the Blue,ep034
975,Door house and then as soon as you enter,ep034
978,its massive and that entrance the foyer,ep034
981,it's just beautiful with that staircase,ep034
984,in here is the living room a formal,ep034
987,living room although they've put in some,ep034
990,custom cabinetry I see this more of an,ep034
993,office than a living space we need more,ep034
996,books it flows right from the living,ep034
999,room so you can expand the family table,ep034
1002,when you're entertaining I actually do,ep034
1005,love this yeah Wow people ate I think,ep034
1008,it's paint,ep034
1011,and the view looks great to view,ep034
1014,entertaining yes oh wow okay there's a,ep034
1017,hot tub right in front of me I didn't,ep034
1020,notice it so you can watch your guests,ep034
1023,in the hot tub yeah while you're serving,ep034
1026,dinner I'll be in the hot tub you just,ep034
1029,feed me wine wow it is pretty big it's,ep034
1032,big yeah there's a pantry for extra,ep034
1035,storage there's plenty of cabinets okay,ep034
1038,this is definitely my style because it,ep034
1041,has the contemporary I can totally you,ep034
1044,know work with it but the appliances,ep034
1047,color has to be changed and the painting,ep034
1050,you know I think it's like greenish,ep034
1053,color that they painted definitely don't,ep034
1056,like the paint I mean with all the,ep034
1059,windows it's it's not that private it is,ep034
1062,not that private I do see the neighbor,ep034
1065,you know so it is close I mean you could,ep034
1068,definitely have the neighbors look in,ep034
1071,and then here's the sunken family room,ep034
1074,open concept which is great so I really,ep034
1077,love that it's very bright yeah,ep034
1080,definitely yeah and contemporary but I,ep034
1083,definitely don't like the carpet love,ep034
1086,this car,ep034
1089,makes you feel home it does they see the,ep034
1092,first bedroom and adjoining,ep034
1095,jack-and-jill bath this is actually nice,ep034

1104,this is the second bedroom it's still,ep034
1107,really small let's go see the bigger,ep034
1110,bedroom okay so this could be a guest,ep034

1149,the finished basement so here's the,ep034
1152,fourth bathroom okay it's pretty good,ep034
1155,science yeah then in this space okay,ep034
1158,which is your theater room wow this is,ep034
1161,really nice we've done if you look at,ep034
1164,that theater room it's like I'll never,ep034
1167,leave this is the sanctuary that I,ep034
1170,needed right here right here,ep034
1173,[Music],ep034
1176,I definitely love the house you know,ep034
1179,first thing it's contemporary the style,ep034
1182,of the outside it doesn't blow me away,ep034
1185,but once we did walk in this house is,ep034
1188,just massive the way it's laid out come,ep034
1191,in you're like wow right,ep034
1194,I love the basement yeah but you know,ep034
1197,this house it's not that private there's,ep034
1200,no fence the neighbors are right there,ep034
1203,four hundred and fifty four thousand,ep034
1206,dollars it's a lot of money with,ep034
1209,multiple houses in mind it's time for,ep034
1212,Ryan and Misha to decide which one they,ep034
1215,want to make a home,ep034
1218,aside from finishing this wine and five,ep034
1221,more I don't know how we're gonna make,ep034
1224,this yeah I definitely need more,ep034
1227,[Music],ep034
1230,tired of living in a townhouse that's,ep034
1233,too small for both of them Ryan and,ep034
1236,Nisha are searching for their first home,ep034
1239,in Buffalo New York with a budget of,ep034
1242,"450,000 dollars and multiple options on",ep034
1245,the table it's time for them to make a,ep034
1248,decision the one with the house with the,ep034
1251,great landscaping that was the one that,ep034
1254,was going for four hundred and fifty,ep034
1257,thousand I like the the style of that,ep034
1260,house I mean driving up the curb appeal,ep034
1263,was fantastic it's not contemporary but,ep034
1266,the kitchen in that house was really,ep034
1269,nice for you it's pretty big,ep034
1272,and I love the view you can cook and,ep034
1275,also see the backyard which was great,ep034
1278,there was only three bedroom even though,ep034
1281,was listed as four-bedroom we could,ep034
1284,always convert it back but then we'd,ep034
1287,have to move the bonzer to the basement,ep034
1290,the door is facing northeast so which is,ep034
1293,a great thing that is true so the house,ep034
1296,with the pool was the one that was,ep034
1299,"$449,000 was colonial style the privacy",ep034
1302,was really good for that house it didn't,ep034
1305,have a finished basement in it but it,ep034
1308,has great potential the door was facing,ep034
1311,south which I don't think my mom would,ep034
1314,but please one thing I didn't like is,ep034
1317,that oak you know I just felt like oak,ep034
1320,City yeah cosmetically yeah we have to,ep034
1323,put a lot of money into the house,ep034
1326,do you have notes on the house with the,ep034
1329,theater room their door was facing north,ep034
1332,which is great and it was 454 thousand,ep034
1335,so it's a little over our budget but you,ep034
1338,know as soon as we entered we had that,ep034
1341,wow factor we've really fell in love,ep034
1344,with it yeah that basement was perfect I,ep034
1347,love that master suite that closet was,ep034
1350,bigger than our kitchen in our townhouse,ep034
1353,but the privacy in that was not good you,ep034
1356,can see your neighbors is a tough,ep034
1359,decision,ep034
1362,aside from finishing this wine and five,ep034
1365,more I don't know how we're gonna make I,ep034
1368,definitely need more of them,ep034
1371,what do you think can you read my mind I,ep034
1374,think the most important thing to you,ep034
1377,would be the kitchen right when I do the,ep034
1380,"yep $550,000 one yes I love it the",ep034
1383,kitchen,ep034
1386,I'm excited okay so why don't we call,ep034
1389,Michelle and sound tell her what we,ep034
1392,decided let's see how it looks right I,ep034
1395,might be skinny but I'm strong me too,ep034
1398,we put the offer on the house several,ep034
1401,months ago and we finally got the keys,ep034
1404,it just took a little while because of,ep034
1407,negotiations back forth you want some,ep034
1410,creeps yes please,ep034
1413,the house was listed for four hundred,ep034
1416,and fifty thousand it was right on our,ep034
1419,top max budget we ended up after long,ep034
1422,negotiations paying four hundred,ep034
1425,thousand for the house which was a great,ep034
1428,thing yeah,ep034
1431,I can I can smell it yes there's not a,ep034
1434,lot of changes that need to be made and,ep034
1437,that's one of the main reasons why we,ep034
1440,decided to take this house over the,ep034
1443,others it just felt right for both of us,ep034
1446,you know this is a Hindu tradition,ep034
1449,because it's a new house so new,ep034
1452,beginning purchasing this house is just,ep034
1455,one of the things that we had to check,ep034
1458,off the list,ep034
1461,once that's done,ep034
1464,now we can start a family we'll be able,ep034
1467,to concentrate on really moving forward,ep034
1470,look forward to that next checkbox that,ep034
1473,needs to come off that list,ep034
12,you know it doesn't have any character,ep035
15,so it would be nice to add some color,ep035
18,Connecticut transplant Bridget wants a,ep035
21,home with character in one of downtown,ep035
24,Austin's established neighborhoods you,ep035
27,have more yards you have more,ep035
30,established trees but staying near the,ep035
33,city and staying in budget might require,ep035
36,taking on a fixer nice can she convince,ep035
39,dad to help out with a little free labor,ep035
42,so she can get into the neighborhood she,ep035
45,wants better seating there little table,ep035
48,new cabinets new countertops my answer,ep035
51,to a lot of that is dream on Bridget or,ep035
54,will he push her to buy a new bill,ep035
57,farther out it's very little work that,ep035
60,I'd have to do,ep035
63,[Music],ep035
66,the frowns Bridgette and occupational,ep035
69,therapist relocated to Texas four years,ep035
72,ago emergency from Connecticut and I was,ep035
75,tired shoveling snow so decided to move,ep035
78,to the warmer climate I've been in,ep035
81,Austin now for about two years,ep035
84,hi I like the mushroom ravioli I think,ep035
87,I'm gonna go there's so much to do you,ep035
90,can go downtown meet up with friends at,ep035
93,breweries everything's local,ep035
96,farm-to-table restaurants you can go out,ep035
99,kayaking so I like that that's,ep035
102,accessible currently I'm renting a house,ep035
105,in South Austin close to the downtown,ep035
108,area five-minute walk away from all the,ep035
111,great restaurants shops right now it's,ep035
114,just Lucy and I living in the house,ep035
117,Lucy's my mini schnauzer now Bridget's,ep035
120,decided that she's ready to put down,ep035
123,some roots and buy a place in Austin the,ep035
126,pricing for housing is going up and I,ep035
129,would like to get into the market before,ep035
132,I'm priced out of the market I love this,ep035
135,house dad with the front porch and the,ep035
138,big established trees this is my dad,ep035
141,Charlie and he's here from Connecticut,ep035
144,to help me with my house hon yeah I can,ep035
147,lend a little bit of wisdom only because,ep035
150,I've owned so many houses what to look,ep035
153,for what to be careful about my dad is,ep035
156,very honest so he never give in very,ep035
159,easily prison is my favorite daughter,ep035
162,my favorite my budget,ep035
165,ideally I'd like to be around 250 but,ep035
168,I'd be willing to go up to about 280,ep035
171,yeah I really like the older,ep035
174,neighborhoods where you have more yards,ep035
177,you have more established trees I don't,ep035
180,like those cookie cutter neighborhoods,ep035
183,really like the Craftsman bungalow style,ep035
186,because I love the old creaky floors the,ep035
189,built-in cabinets I love the old,ep035
192,fireplaces reminds me of home in New,ep035
195,England we have a lot of older historic,ep035
198,homes and I think it's comforting,ep035
201,ideally I want character I want a,ep035
204,bungalow I want a craftsman but I have a,ep035
207,feeling they're out of my price point,ep035
210,she's open to other styles and even if,ep035
213,Fixer if she can stay close to her,ep035
216,current location downtown I'm open to,ep035
219,renovations my dad is a handyman he can,ep035
222,fix anything dad dad we need this done,ep035
225,we need that done my answer to a lot of,ep035
228,that is dream on Bridget okay I could,ep035
231,replace a floor I can probably even do,ep035
234,some cabinet work in the kitchen I just,ep035
237,don't want to get into major work when I,ep035
240,come down to vacation I would like a,ep035
243,larger kitchen I love to cook and bake I,ep035
246,also love white kitchens lots of natural,ep035
249,lights open to the living room I love to,ep035
252,cook and have people over three bedrooms,ep035
255,two baths if dad wants to come yeah when,ep035
258,I visit I'm gonna have my own space,ep035
261,definitely purchasing a home in Austin,ep035
264,means I have a place to settle down for,ep035
267,a bit I've moved quite a lot since,ep035
270,moving to Austin so I'd love to be able,ep035
273,to hang the curtains and know that in a,ep035
276,year I'm not gonna have to move because,ep035
279,my housing price will no first up,ep035
282,Bridget's agent Marlo is showing her a,ep035
285,home that's walking distance from,ep035
288,downtown a little bit more of a,ep035
291,fixer-upper and it is listed at 255,ep035
294,thousand okay it's like the ranch in the,ep035
297,woods it is cute and this rain makes it,ep035
300,cozy right I'm not so sure about this,ep035
303,garage door yeah somebody ran into that,ep035
306,garage door I'm not crazy about the,ep035
309,brown color but um I think it's cute it,ep035
312,actually is a cute little house I like,ep035
315,the bay window right here this is great,ep035
318,right if we shrink down the bushes a,ep035
321,little bit watch your step,ep035
324,this looks nice job number two this is,ep035
327,cute,ep035
330,I like the tall ceilings so this is the,ep035
333,dining room this is so you have but,ep035
336,you're don't you have a pretty good,ep035
339,sized dining table I do get size much,ep035
342,fit in here I do not like that light,ep035
345,fixture job number three and this is a,ep035
348,pretty good space where you're living,ep035
351,yeah your living room furniture I like,ep035
354,the flow I like that it's just open you,ep035
357,could be eating watching TV I really,ep035
360,like the fireplace what do you think of,ep035
363,the floor I mean I wouldn't prefer the,ep035
366,hardwoods,ep035
369,I wouldn't what I have to take this up,ep035
372,maybe some built-ins or just something,ep035
375,to give it a little bit more character,ep035
378,would be yes let's take a look in the,ep035
381,kitchen we'll go outside where it's,ep035
384,raining so dark in here but I feel like,ep035
387,this is a really nice space you could,ep035
390,make this really cute I'd probably put,ep035
393,in a bench seating there little table,ep035
396,new cabinets new countertops,ep035
399,I think the appliances probably need to,ep035
402,this needs to go the floors are okay but,ep035
405,I think eventually it would be nice to,ep035
408,just do one flooring throughout since it,ep035
411,is a smaller house and you want to break,ep035
414,it up we know this house is a little bit,ep035
417,older it needs some renovations a lot,ep035
420,like me,ep035
423,a lot of the renovation work that would,ep035
426,be done I could probably do it might be,ep035
429,pretty taxing and there here is one of,ep035
432,two guest bedrooms it's small but I like,ep035
435,the built-ins could you stay here yeah,ep035
438,it's no stubby but it is probably room,ep035
441,for enough furniture in there Oh dad you,ep035
444,get a walk-in closet here dad you could,ep035
447,fit all your clothes Wow for you,ep035
450,month-long stay when you're living here,ep035
453,and fixing up the floors in the kitchen,ep035
456,we have the guest bathroom,ep035
459,this is totally there's got to be,ep035
462,totally redone exciting very dated,ep035
465,really dated so down here you have your,ep035
468,second guest bedroom okay and then in,ep035
471,here we have the master bedroom all,ep035
474,right this is nice size,ep035
477,all right hate that this is open I would,ep035
480,want doors and I would not want carpet,ep035
483,that's really gross,ep035
486,so what I would suggest doing is putting,ep035
489,one of those sliding barn doors on my,ep035
492,brother and dad made my cousin perfect,ep035
495,this needs to go this is really dated,ep035
498,it's a little small but at least it's a,ep035
501,walk-in I don't know it all my clothes,ep035
504,according to dad I don't think so that,ep035
507,makes it better that's nice yeah so now,ep035
510,she only needs one guest room closet oh,ep035
513,okay this is private,ep035
516,oh this deck has got to be totally,ep035
519,redone,ep035
522,I like the mature trees though I think,ep035
525,this yard would be great for Lucy I,ep035
528,could see us playing out here for sure,ep035
531,I just really like the privacy it's,ep035
534,quiet out here we're in this beautiful,ep035
537,country setting but we're really close,ep035
540,to downtown Austin Rennie we're in a,ep035
543,city,ep035
546,[Music],ep035
549,I really like the layout I think it's,ep035
552,the right size you know if I put in you,ep035
555,know some bench seating in the kitchen,ep035
558,you might get cozy like I feel like this,ep035
561,house would be really sweet with a,ep035
564,little bit of love you know I could see,ep035
567,myself here I am worried though with how,ep035
570,much needs to be renovated I think Dad,ep035
573,would have to move in for like four or,ep035
576,five months to do maybe the next house,ep035
579,we could see something that's a little,ep035
582,bit more renovated but still has that,ep035
585,charm that I'm looking for,ep035
588,okay well look at it okay thanks,ep035
591,unstraight so Marla's lined up a new,ep035
594,construction craftsman but there aren't,ep035
597,established trees very close to the,ep035
600,neighbors remember when I first moved to,ep035
603,Austin I took you here with a strict,ep035
606,"280,000 dollar budget for a home in",ep035
609,pricey Austin Texas bridget is hoping,ep035
612,she can rope her dad into doing some,ep035
615,renovations on a budget fixer-upper in,ep035
618,an established neighborhood,ep035
621,[Music],ep035
624,they've seen a 70s era ranch in her,ep035
627,target area in an older neighborhood,ep035
630,with mature trees near downtown but it,ep035
633,might need more work than dad is willing,ep035
636,to take on and it wasn't a craftsman her,ep035
639,ideal style to find Bridget a craftsman,ep035
642,in her price range her agents taking her,ep035
645,to see a new build 20 minutes from,ep035
648,downtown what you can see we're in a new,ep035
651,construction neighborhood very nearly,ep035
654,new but these homes are beautiful and,ep035
657,"they're priced well at 250 1,000 there",ep035
660,aren't established trees though you know,ep035
663,very close to the neighbors but it is a,ep035
666,Craftsman style which I like yeah I like,ep035
669,the stoneware mixed in with siding,ep035
672,that's the one thing about great about,ep035
675,this builder is the homes can not be,ep035
678,exactly the same next to each other but,ep035
681,it's nice for a new bill cuz I don't,ep035
684,like the cookie cutter bridget,ep035
687,definitely has voice she does not want a,ep035
690,new home and so it was a risk bringing,ep035
693,her here and I do feel though that this,ep035
696,home has this great Craftsman style,ep035
699,charm it does fit within her price range,ep035
702,and it's gonna be difficult to find,ep035
705,exactly what she's looking for in that,ep035
708,price range this is a good alternative,ep035
711,and we walk into what could be a dining,ep035
714,room I think it should you had a dining,ep035
717,table I do I have an oval shape so that,ep035
720,would probably fit maybe right here Wow,ep035
723,I like the artist is nice the archways,ep035
726,make it look like it's an older home,ep035
729,what is this flooring so the flooring is,ep035
732,looks like wood but it's actually tile,ep035
735,I'm not sure I want tile I like wood,ep035
738,floor the creaks but its new looks like,ep035
741,wood so let's take a look in the kitchen,ep035
744,I love the white kitchen I do love that,ep035
747,now you like white kitchens it looks a,ep035
750,little new it doesn't have any character,ep035
753,so it would be nice to add some color we,ep035
756,can go shopping for doorknobs I can put,ep035
759,those in all the cabinet stuff would be,ep035
762,easy to do they put great antique stores,ep035
765,here maybe go down to an antique store,ep035
768,and find out some great yeah I like how,ep035
771,it's open to the living room and have,ep035
774,this beautiful fire it's a great,ep035
777,fireplace I do love the fireplace,ep035
780,however it seems to take up a lot of the,ep035
783,space in the living room like where,ep035
786,would you put your furniture if you had,ep035
789,barstools there I don't think your,ep035
792,existing couches gone no I don't think,ep035
795,that fit in here great excuse to buy new,ep035
798,furniture they see the laundry room and,ep035
801,half bath then the first floor master,ep035
804,suite it's a very large bedroom this is,ep035
807,huge,ep035
810,actually I'd rather the space be in the,ep035
813,living room but you know what you can,ep035
816,have a wonderful sitting area in here,ep035
819,and a huge king-size bed it's got a,ep035
822,beautiful windows do you think we could,ep035
825,change out the blades to make them white,ep035
828,so it doesn't stand out so much we can,ep035
831,maybe paint and I can take the blades,ep035
834,off and paint them up Oh dad you can do,ep035
837,anything you can't do anything he's good,ep035
840,like that,ep035
843,this is huge huge right I love the,ep035
846,counter I like that it's the same as the,ep035
849,kitchen how about the separate tub and,ep035
852,shower I actually never used a tub so,ep035
855,that's kind of wasted space for me but I,ep035
858,guess it is nice I could wash Lucy in,ep035
861,there yeah love that this is nice,ep035
864,faucets I probably still have way too,ep035
867,many clothes you do but we have two more,ep035
870,closets and two more bedrooms here that,ep035
873,we can fill up with all your clothes,ep035
876,okay I'm not sure I like the carpet on,ep035
879,the stairway well I feel like carpet on,ep035
882,stairways end upstairs though because,ep035
885,it's so much quieter on the second floor,ep035
888,with carpet you do have your dad's,ep035
891,bedroom over here and then dad here's,ep035
894,your bathroom right here,ep035
897,and then we do have an extra bedroom for,ep035
900,guests on in here dad your lady friends,ep035
903,have to stay in separate rooms great,ep035
906,they head back downstairs and out to the,ep035
909,back yard did you have a really nice,ep035
912,patio in the backyard I think those,ep035
915,weeds are more mature than the tree not,ep035
918,so sure I like being this close to my,ep035
921,neighbor it looks like they could watch,ep035
924,everything I'm doing out here yeah but,ep035
927,this is a great yard for Lucy to run,ep035
930,really large yard this fully fenced,ep035
933,fully fenced yard right okay for a new,ep035
936,home it does have a lot of character,ep035
939,which I like,ep035
942,I love the white kitchen I'm still,ep035
945,concerned about the size of this living,ep035
948,room neighbors being so close no mature,ep035
951,trees the construction noise yeah,ep035
954,there's very little work that I'd have,ep035
957,to do so now they're seeing a home in,ep035
960,her target area and this one's turnkey,ep035
963,[Applause],ep035
966,[Music],ep035
969,[Music],ep035
972,Luci you want some chips Bridget has a,ep035
975,"280,000 dollar budget for a home with",ep035
978,character in downtown Austin and she,ep035
981,doesn't mind putting her dad to work on,ep035
984,some renovations dad is hoping that she,ep035
987,settles on a turnkey home with very few,ep035
990,projects for him to do so far they've,ep035
993,seen a ranch fixer near downtown that,ep035
996,would keep dad busy for months and a new,ep035
999,construction craftsman 20 minutes,ep035
1002,outside of the city with almost no,ep035
1005,projects for dad today they're seeing,ep035
1008,another home in Bridget's target area,ep035
1011,five minutes from downtown well today,ep035
1014,we're showing you a home that's at the,ep035
1017,top end of your budget it is at two,ep035
1020,hundred sixty nine thousand nine hundred,ep035
1023,pesos still in my budget,ep035
1026,and we're close to downtown which is,ep035
1029,nice it's a ranch yes I like the trees,ep035
1032,in the neighborhood but I'm not sure,ep035
1035,about the color the brick well it is a,ep035
1038,three-bedroom two-bath and it is turnkey,ep035
1041,dad it's definitely a seventies ranch,ep035
1044,yes dad first repair is scraping party,ep035
1047,wow this is a big girl I really like,ep035
1050,this fireplace and this is huge big,ep035
1053,windows to light it's beautiful and what,ep035
1056,do I like your bed like the floors I,ep035
1059,like that they carried it throughout is,ep035
1062,this the dining room area it yes it is,ep035
1065,okay my table would definitely fit right,ep035
1068,here and then I can maybe get a hutch to,ep035
1071,put my grandma's China in this is pretty,ep035
1074,light bright these lights are really,ep035
1077,old-school but uh nice light cabinets,ep035
1080,it's,ep035
1083,really small I feel like I'm in my,ep035
1086,rental house yeah you do no dance,ep035
1089,you couldn't entertain that's for sure,ep035
1092,like if I had people over I couldn't,ep035
1095,really see my spots ago right hello you,ep035
1098,know,ep035
1101,first guest bathroom I'm small but,ep035
1104,updated yeah probably have to change up,ep035
1107,the light up there kind of dated guest,ep035
1110,room this is my size there's no closet,ep035
1113,here bridge oh yeah there isn't where am,ep035
1116,I going to put my clothes no how long,ep035
1119,you staying you'd have to put a wardrobe,ep035
1122,for sitting here yeah we have the second,ep035
1125,guest bedroom here okay and then through,ep035
1128,here is the master bedroom,ep035
1131,oh I love the light the big windows I,ep035
1134,think everything would fit for sure,ep035
1137,popcorn ceiling another room better,ep035
1140,another week in Oz and then we can,ep035
1143,Austin not so bad maybe we'll need that,ep035
1146,closet and here is the master bathroom,ep035
1149,it is a bit small,ep035
1152,yeah it is really small it's not dated,ep035
1155,which is nice I wish that there was a,ep035
1158,window,ep035
1161,I don't like bathrooms of that windows,ep035
1164,dark yeah,ep035
1167,hey done you want to put in a walk-in,ep035
1170,shower instead they head out to the,ep035
1173,backyard that's big I like the big trees,ep035
1176,fully fenced for Lucy almost big enough,ep035
1179,for a pickleball court,ep035
1182,[Music],ep035
1185,I like the location close to downtown,ep035
1188,I'm close to work quiet neighborhood,ep035
1191,mature trees however I just feel like,ep035
1194,it's lacking that character that I'm,ep035
1197,looking for there's definitely some,ep035
1200,pretty big things left to be done but,ep035
1203,you want to get rid of the popcorn,ep035
1206,ceiling the small bathroom after seeing,ep035
1209,several options it won't be an easy,ep035
1212,decision for Brigette her choice may,ep035
1215,come down to location condition and,ep035
1218,style you might be surprised really,ep035
1221,[Music],ep035
1224,Bridget and her father have seen how,ep035
1227,much home two hundred and eighty,ep035
1230,thousand dollars will get her in Austin,ep035
1233,now it's time to decide the ranch in the,ep035
1236,"woods the fixer-upper 255,000 it was",ep035
1239,close to downtown,ep035
1242,I liked the space I thought it was the,ep035
1245,right size I mean you're definitely a,ep035
1248,much bigger yard a lot of privacy in the,ep035
1251,back and I feel like with cosmetic,ep035
1254,updates and just some work it would be a,ep035
1257,really cute house we just the kitchen,ep035
1260,alone you know it would probably take me,ep035
1263,a month it's gonna be costly it's not,ep035
1266,gonna be cheap fixes the new builds,ep035
1269,"251,000 it surprised me you know the",ep035
1272,nice archways the kitchen was beautiful,ep035
1275,however it's you know really far from,ep035
1278,downtown I really don't like being that,ep035
1281,close to neighbors there's not much that,ep035
1284,I got to do you can just move in when I,ep035
1287,come down I can play rather than work,ep035
1290,yeah but do you remember how small that,ep035
1293,living room was I'd have to get new,ep035
1296,furniture what did you think of the 1978,ep035
1299,ranch the price point of that was 269,ep035
1302,nine that house cuz it was walkable to,ep035
1305,downtown I could get anywhere quickly,ep035
1308,and then it had the big mature trees a,ep035
1311,private backyard it was a good size but,ep035
1314,I felt like the renovations made it very,ep035
1317,boring you could move right in yeah well,ep035
1320,you have to do anything major,ep035
1323,I loved the huge living room dining room,ep035
1326,a lot of natural light had the fire,ep035
1329,please but then you walked in and it was,ep035
1332,just this tiny little galley kitchen,ep035
1335,yeah and they're still improvements that,ep035
1338,are needed,ep035
1341,[Music],ep035
1344,I think I really want to go,ep035
1347,he might be surprised really,ep035
1350,with the new bill whoa I know I like,ep035
1353,that idea,ep035
1356,because I thought it was cute I liked,ep035
1359,the archways it didn't make the space,ep035
1362,feel as new it kind of gave it character,ep035
1365,for a new build didn't seem boring yeah,ep035
1368,I'd rather come out and play have to do,ep035
1371,a whole lot of work yeah,ep035
1374,I thought we could do like an herb bro,ep035
1377,and then I'll do some veggies I closed,ep035
1380,on the house about six weeks ago and I,ep035
1383,moved in about three weeks ago I ended,ep035
1386,up paying two hundred and fifty one,ep035
1389,thousand for the house which was the,ep035
1392,asking price because this area is so hot,ep035
1395,that you have to go in with a really,ep035
1398,good offer you're gonna mess in my new,ep035
1401,kitchen you're kicked out I really,ep035
1404,wanted the old chairman Austin but when,ep035
1407,I saw the price point and then with the,ep035
1410,new build I saw what I could get for my,ep035
1413,money for the same price I decided it,ep035
1416,would be a smarter decision to go with,ep035
1419,the new build just because I wouldn't,ep035
1422,have to fix anything but because it has,ep035
1425,the arches and it's just very light and,ep035
1428,airy and bright it reminds me of a,ep035
1431,little cottage I did end up buying a new,ep035
1434,loveseat because it my couch wouldn't,ep035
1437,fit so I ended up making another TV room,ep035
1440,slash office upstairs and put my couch,ep035
1443,up there so kind of made it work but did,ep035
1446,have to buy a couple new pieces this is,ep035
1449,what easier than I thought I think I,ep035
1452,need to add another project dad ended up,ep035
1455,coming down and he helped me just with,ep035
1458,some odds and ends he caught me hanging,ep035
1461,the curtains helped with mirrors and he,ep035
1464,also helped me hang the first week I,ep035
1467,think this was a great choice for bridge,ep035
1470,now I can come down and just play I got,ep035
1473,my own suite upstairs and I don't give,ep035
1476,him a curfew you're gonna like it up,ep035
1479,doors huh so since you're such a great,ep035
1482,help with this whole process and making,ep035
1485,multiple trips to come down to help me,ep035
1488,house hunt I decided to buy him a puppy,ep035
1491,he is so cute little chocolate mini,ep035
1494,schnauzer I think this is gonna be,ep035
1497,really sad when the puppy goes back home,ep035
1500,to Connecticut so I'm hoping he'll come,ep035
1503,down and bring him what,ep035
1506,I think this is a great space for me to,ep035
1509,grow into there's something about this,ep035
1512,house a friend even came over and said,ep035
1515,this house just seems happy it's gorge,ep035
1518,bridge thanks dad,ep035

36,isn't it,ep036
39,Sarah's anxiety is at an all-time high,ep036
42,since she'll be isolated in a foreign,ep036
45,country with a new baby bill will be,ep036
48,travelling quite a bit for work and,ep036

54,she wants to be away from the city,ep036
57,centers they can have more room I'm,ep036

63,feeling the pressure as he sees the,ep036
66,family bank account dwindle away on the,ep036
69,house hunt it's really worth every penny,ep036
72,shame that's not too bad we are going,ep036
75,down to one income however I did give up,ep036
78,my career to move here we'll see what,ep036

117,are you ready Bill's been given an,ep036
120,opportunity to work abroad we chose,ep036
123,South Africa because it was just so,ep036
126,different from anything that we've ever,ep036
129,experienced before you know his first,ep036
132,steps are gonna be in Africa here right,ep036
135,that's crazy,ep036
138,we've lived in in Europe before but,ep036
141,never never even been to sub-saharan,ep036
144,Africa so we're really excited I think a,ep036
147,big great opportunity to grow but to,ep036
150,take the job Sarah had to give up her,ep036
153,career will not be working and that's,ep036
156,going to be a challenge for me I think,ep036
159,ready but at the end of the day you,ep036
162,really only got these opportunities a,ep036
165,couple times in your life you're bigger,ep036
168,laughs let's just pile on all the life,ep036
171,changes at one time there's really no,ep036
174,manual or handbook to how to be a parent,ep036
177,so moving to a new country and figuring,ep036
180,out how to hit the ground running and,ep036
183,make sure our child is happy and healthy,ep036
186,it's definitely on my mind a little bit,ep036
189,day and a little bit here so we are a,ep036
192,mother-daughter team that basically grew,ep036
195,up in it because my mom's been doing it,ep036
198,since I was 1 years old,ep036
201,Johannesburg is called the City of Gold,ep036
204,because we based around gold mines so,ep036
207,that is the economic hub of Joburg so,ep036
210,all the businesses all the finance,ep036
213,everything is there it's a really,ep036
216,energetic area restaurants bars all,ep036
219,those kind of things so it's really fun,ep036
222,place to live in Johannesburg is a,ep036
225,rental market because we have a lot of,ep036
228,clients from overseas,ep036
231,to live in a gated community is what,ep036
234,most clients are often today purely,ep036
237,because they feel safe so that is where,ep036
240,the market is going to my number one,ep036
243,priority is being close to work I'd like,ep036
246,to spend as much time at home with,ep036
249,family rather than stuck in traffic but,ep036
252,since I will be staying home with the,ep036
255,baby quite a bit I would love to have as,ep036
258,much space as possible I know it might,ep036
261,have to be farther from bills work I did,ep036
264,pick up and move my life here we'd also,ep036
267,love three bedrooms if possible,ep036
270,one for us one for the baby and then one,ep036
273,for our guests we're hoping to have lots,ep036
276,of friends and family businesses to cool,ep036
279,would be amazing we'll be okay well I,ep036
282,also want a large yard I want to be able,ep036
285,to grill or Bry I hear you hear bragging,ep036
288,is very popular here so what is your,ep036
291,price range that you're looking at we're,ep036
294,"looking at about $1,800 are you flexible",ep036
297,on that I'm hoping that we can find what,ep036
300,we're looking for within our budget I,ep036
303,would be okay with going over especially,ep036
306,if it means more space to make Sebastian,ep036
309,and myself more comfortable I think you,ep036
312,already get quite a bit for your money,ep036
315,here so I don't think there's any reason,ep036
318,to go over your budget here Bianca and,ep036
321,Vera's start the hunt in a vibrant,ep036
324,Johannesburg suburb called Melrose arch,ep036
327,this place stacks up quite well on they,ep036
330,Chiklis it's got the Bolton Bry it,ep036
333,doesn't have the pool and the third,ep036
336,bedroom but it's right on budget so I,ep036
339,think that makes up for it so molar is,ep036
342,all choose a nice suburbs very modern,ep036
345,sounds good yeah so here we are a modern,ep036
348,time I see there's a bride yes it's a,ep036
351,2-bedroom 2-bathroom and it's right on,ep036
354,"budget at 1,800 so right up your alley",ep036
357,as you call it will have our way is it,ep036
360,from 15 to 20 minutes,ep036
363,unfortunately there's no for you it's,ep036
366,nice I was picturing more space to be,ep036
369,honest and real grass instead of,ep036
372,artificial grass but I'm keeping an open,ep036
375,mind first impressions I don't really,ep036
378,love what I see no pool no third bedroom,ep036
381,I was hoping for something a lot nicer,ep036
384,okay guys I'm going to have a nope yeah,ep036
387,definitely hmm I don't know I really,ep036
390,like the furniture it's very modern I,ep036
393,think it speaks to us what's nice is,ep036
396,you've got three appliances yeah so,ep036
399,dishes after having entertained did you,ep036
402,tuck them in there yeah I mean it's it's,ep036
405,furnished not exactly my style to me it,ep036
408,just feels kind of cheap I think bill,ep036
411,likes the fact that it's on budget to,ep036
414,him that's a concern for me not so much,ep036
417,maybe stairs it's very modern yeah but,ep036
420,you know with Sebastian this seems,ep036
423,awfully dangerous yeah but we can,ep036
426,baby-proof it this is a guest bedroom,ep036
429,I love the skylight skyla is nice and,ep036
432,there's an ensuite bathroom oh it has a,ep036
435,tub and a shower yep and a double basin,ep036
438,double basin that's nice we do have a,ep036
441,lot of stairs don't need to fight,ep036
444,anymore yeah yeah what's nice is it's,ep036
447,carpeted so full Sebastian you can play,ep036
450,on the floor yeah very true yeah I have,ep036
453,a new appreciation for carpets now that,ep036
456,I have a little one he falls everywhere,ep036
459,I think there's plenty of space here for,ep036
462,both a crib and a bed maybe maybe,ep036
465,however you know I was hoping for three,ep036
468,bedrooms full wants to be close to work,ep036
471,but that means Sarah won't have the,ep036
474,space she'll have if we go further out,ep036
477,even there's only two bedrooms I think,ep036
480,we can make it work and it's still in,ep036
483,budget of course I can tell Sarah's not,ep036
486,excited about this property but I think,ep036
489,she I think she can learn to really love,ep036
492,it so here is your lovely sunny main,ep036
495,bedroom I love all the light that comes,ep036
498,in here I mean we have two skylights and,ep036
501,we have this big window and I mean,ep036
504,because it's big enough you could put,ep036
507,Sebastian's crib here yeah and keep the,ep036
510,guest bedroom that would work do you,ep036
513,think you know I I really was sat on,ep036
516,three bedrooms when you close to the,ep036
519,city center it's more modern it's,ep036
522,smaller places this is general townhouse,ep036
525,living yeah you know that's what you can,ep036
528,expect,ep036
531,Sarah would like to be out in the,ep036
534,country that's sweet Sarah wants to,ep036
537,really read I really liked it I mean I,ep036
540,think we can move in tomorrow,ep036
543,I liked the two bedrooms I like the,ep036
546,space I like the bra area that was,ep036
549,really nice I really expect this within,ep036
552,budget that's fantastic,ep036
555,I do wish it was a little closer to work,ep036
558,I mean it was 15 minutes I would like to,ep036
561,see something in the center of city I,ep036
564,mean I wasn't a huge fan I didn't love,ep036
567,this beginning outdoor area but it was a,ep036
570,little small I would still like to see a,ep036
573,place with three bedrooms and also some,ep036
576,more outdoor space particularly a pool,ep036
579,you know I really wanted a pool but one,ep036
582,Sarah seems to really want different,ep036
585,things,ep036
588,this place has a bride and it's right on,ep036
591,budget I think that's,ep036
594,that's exactly what you're looking for,ep036
597,Wow is there a bride no I'm afraid to,ep036
600,ask how much it cost there's always,ep036
603,gonna be some cost involved in moving,ep036
606,across the world that's not a big deal I,ep036
609,mean look at the space to be a first,ep036
612,wildlife adventure in Africa Joe and I,ep036
615,went to college together he dated for,ep036
618,nine years got married yeah just,ep036
621,recently had a kid so we're kind of,ep036
624,moving up the stage on the stages of,ep036
627,life together Wow,ep036
630,do you see the gym yeah it's blowing,ep036
633,your mind isn't it yeah I think there,ep036
636,was quite a bit of hesitation because of,ep036
639,the child we're new parents we don't,ep036
642,really know what we're doing,ep036
645,to be honest it's surprising that once,ep036
648,you have a baby the hospital staff just,ep036
651,says here's your baby,ep036
654,good luck we're leaving behind a,ep036
657,Philadelphia is our support network I,ep036
660,did have a great group of mom friends in,ep036
663,Philadelphia we all gave birth around,ep036
666,the same time and went through the same,ep036
669,milestones and challenges together our,ep036
672,friends and family are all back in,ep036
675,Philadelphia we're hoping that our with,ep036
678,our family business but also our friends,ep036
681,and coworkers visit as well is there I,ep036
684,know your spirit animal I think that's a,ep036
687,yes I think he's found a spirit animal,ep036
690,here in Johannesburg we don't even know,ep036
693,what like way to we buy diapers where do,ep036
696,we get help if we need help with the,ep036
699,baby where's the nearest doctor we have,ep036
702,no idea,ep036
705,you should look that up we should know,ep036
708,now that we live and how that we should,ep036
711,Sarah feels like house 1 is a tight fit,ep036
714,for herself and baby Sebastian it's a,ep036
717,2-bedroom 2-bathroom I was hoping for,ep036
720,something a lot nicer no pool no 3rd,ep036
723,bedroom 3 would be quite nice because we,ep036
726,could have space for our hopefully many,ep036
729,"guests it's right on budget at 1,800",ep036
732,that is nice I was picturing more,ep036
735,space to be honest I think bill likes,ep036
738,the fact that it's on budget I love all,ep036
741,the light that comes in here I mean with,ep036
744,two skylights and we have this big,ep036
747,window to me it just feels kind of cheap,ep036
750,I just don't see it to me it's not us,ep036
753,Sarah's still umas wants that lifestyle,ep036
756,like she's in enough normal suburb yeah,ep036
759,seeing all these animals makes me want,ep036
762,to go on a safari yeah we're going to go,ep036
765,to Safari zoo let's put that the top of,ep036
768,our list definitely after after seeing,ep036
771,Sarah's reaction to the first house,ep036
774,Bianca and Vera decide to take the hunt,ep036
777,even farther out of the city center,ep036
780,because Sarah is often quite a spacious,ep036
783,unit this is more suitable for her and,ep036
786,Sebastian's needs so we'll try to save,ep036
789,their marriage,ep036
792,Wow look at all the space and trees and,ep036
795,plants and grasses,ep036
798,is there a bride no no okay so we're,ep036
801,looking at a three-bedroom two-bathroom,ep036
804,how far away's is from work yeah so this,ep036
807,one's a bit further you're looking at 25,ep036
810,to 30 minutes depending on traffic,ep036
813,that's not a big deal I mean look at the,ep036
816,space I'm afraid to ask how much it,ep036
819,costs slightly over budget at mm that's,ep036
822,not too bad it's really worth every,ep036
825,painting of it oh wow wow it's very,ep036
828,spacious yeah look at this look at the,ep036
831,fire no so it comes fully finished I,ep036
834,love this furniture I think it's really,ep036
837,classy just looks very well made but one,ep036
840,thing that is on my mind is these tiles,ep036
843,they also don't appear to be super safe,ep036
846,for the baby hmm,ep036
849,yeah he's just learning how to walk so,ep036
852,we have rugs and a girl supply and,ep036
855,wherever budget okay well look at what,ep036
858,we're getting I mean it is not yes a,ep036
861,very beautiful space so far I can see,ep036
864,Bill in his mind calculating all the,ep036
867,extra things we'll need to buy for this,ep036
870,house new stairs don't see me,ep036
873,say yeah you'd have to baby-proof thing,ep036
876,but I think he's got to loosen up on the,ep036
879,budget I really don't think it's a,ep036
882,concern I think it's fine to pay for,ep036
885,these things this is the master bedroom,ep036
888,with the ensuite bathroom yeah this,ep036
891,could definitely work for us it's not a,ep036
894,huge master bedroom but it's I think,ep036
897,plenty of space so this is your guest,ep036
900,bedroom as you call it what size I mean,ep036
903,for the price point so I was expecting,ep036
906,something slightly bigger this room,ep036
909,seems more than adequate to me I think,ep036
912,there are guests left plenty of space,ep036
915,so this is being used as a study but,ep036
918,it'd be Sebastian's paper I love that,ep036
921,there's carpet and the rooms upstairs,ep036
924,it's gonna be great for the baby I don't,ep036
927,have to be so concerned that he might,ep036
930,hurt himself,ep036
933,I see our neighbors have a pool do we,ep036
936,help saw the pool not in this particular,ep036
939,unit now that's kind of a tease yes,ep036
942,cavities overall I love this place,ep036
945,I love the fact that there's three,ep036
948,bedrooms plenty of space for our guests,ep036
951,look at this garden I can really see,ep036
954,myself and Sebastian playing out here,ep036
957,especially when you are traveling,ep036
960,honestly there's nothing I didn't like,ep036
963,except for the fact there wasn't a pool,ep036
966,I just wish it was within budget I mean,ep036
969,we still need to buy you know grill of,ep036
972,rug and it's farther away from from my,ep036
975,office so I'm spending more time in,ep036
978,traffic which is not ideal I know it's,ep036
981,not that much over our budget but we,ep036
984,have to be smart about how we spend our,ep036
987,money we are going down to one income,ep036
990,after all I mean I did give up my career,ep036
993,to come here I made a lot of sacrifice,ep036
996,so hopefully he can we can have some,ep036
999,give-and-take and we can push the budget,ep036
1002,so you're gonna love it is it's under,ep036
1005,"budget that's 1,600 oh nice yeah but",ep036
1008,there's no third bedroom yeah I think we,ep036
1011,can make the space work,ep036
1014,[Music],ep036
1017,we're ready to go cool it's gonna be,ep036
1020,easy easy peasy we got this right good,ep036
1023,time apart from each other is nothing,ep036
1026,new to Bill and Sarah but it'll be very,ep036
1029,different now with a baby,ep036
1032,and in a foreign country we've been,ep036
1035,dying to move abroad so when Bill got a,ep036
1038,good job he said absolutely let's do it,ep036
1041,we're up for an adventure no just a,ep036
1044,crazy relationship I mean together the,ep036
1047,whole time but geographically separate a,ep036
1050,few times he studied abroad in the UK,ep036
1053,when I moved to London he got his job in,ep036
1056,Philly I stayed behind and went in to,ep036
1059,wrap up my job that was just a simple,ep036
1062,maze but we're really lost finally an,ep036
1065,opening,ep036
1068,I mean geographically we've been all,ep036
1071,over the place let's make us a challenge,ep036
1074,how about first one to get out gets to,ep036
1077,choose the house,ep036
1080,ooh high stakes are you ready you're on,ep036
1083,all right ready break there's been,ep036
1086,difficult living you know thousands of,ep036
1089,miles apart in different time zones and,ep036
1092,so we move to Johannesburg really we,ep036
1095,really want to move together and,ep036
1098,especially since that we have a kid I do,ep036
1101,describe this I'm gonna win it's all,ep036
1104,very complicated okay Bill and Sarah's,ep036
1107,house-hunting priorities are not,ep036
1110,matching up Sarah wants space to stretch,ep036
1113,out for herself and baby Sebastian,ep036
1116,I don't really love what I see is there,ep036
1119,a pool unfortunately there's no but a,ep036
1122,third bedroom that's really important to,ep036
1125,me when you close to the city center,ep036
1128,it's small modern at smaller places,ep036
1131,while Bill is feeling the stress of,ep036
1134,having only one income I really like the,ep036
1137,furniture it's very modern I think it,ep036
1140,speaks to us it's slightly over budget,ep036
1143,"that's 2,000",ep036
1146,that's not a big deal I mean look at the,ep036
1149,space yeah look at this look at the fire,ep036
1152,so we have rugs and a girl supply and,ep036
1155,wherever budget okay he's a number,ep036
1158,cruncher as we put it and he will do,ep036
1161,analysis paralysis I don't know that,ep036
1164,makes sense to you guys,ep036
1167,we have to be smart about how we spend,ep036
1170,our money overall I love this place it's,ep036
1173,gonna be great for the baby I don't have,ep036
1176,to be so concerned that he might hurt,ep036
1179,himself I just wish it was within budget,ep036
1182,not a concern for me I might be able to,ep036
1185,convince bill,ep036
1188,to push the budget we taking bull and,ep036
1191,Sarah to city center apartment this is a,ep036
1194,good option for them because it's four,ep036
1197,minutes away from where bulwarks and a,ep036
1200,budget at the pool and it's got the pool,ep036
1203,which saris ideally there has been often,ep036
1206,so here we are right near the city,ep036
1209,center you are four minutes away from,ep036
1212,the city center holy for this way to,ep036
1215,work it's two bedrooms two bathrooms and,ep036
1218,full you're gonna love it is this under,ep036
1221,budget at 1600 oh nice yeah but there's,ep036
1224,no third bedroom unfortunately not,ep036
1227,because we're so close to the city,ep036
1230,center it's gonna be harder to get a,ep036
1233,three-bedroom in budget where do we sign,ep036
1236,come on it's no-brainer Wow it's a bit,ep036
1239,small but it is open is open I mean this,ep036
1242,curved wall is strange but I think I,ep036
1245,could get used to this I can see,ep036
1248,entertaining guests from here,ep036
1251,I do wish there's a little more light,ep036
1254,coming in then you've got your lounge,ep036
1257,there's a lot more light coming into,ep036
1260,this area yeah yeah I like this space so,ep036
1263,here's the comfy guest bedroom hmm it's,ep036
1266,a bit small I'm a little concerned I,ep036
1269,mean if this is there's only two,ep036
1272,bedrooms when you just figure out how,ep036
1275,the baby and our guests are going to fit,ep036
1278,in yeah you might have to put sebastian,ep036
1281,with you guys this could work that was,ep036
1284,bigger than there's many other places,ep036
1287,we've seen I think Bill's trying to get,ep036
1290,me to like this because he just likes,ep036
1293,the price of this apartment wait till,ep036
1296,you see the Mosta how nice is this room,ep036
1299,now this is nice and we have balcony,ep036
1302,yeah so you can sing to Sarah it has,ep036
1305,really nice furniture plenty of space,ep036
1308,and it has that Juliet balcony where,ep036
1311,Sarah can serenade me you serenade me,ep036
1314,right Sarah this is what you were,ep036
1317,looking for yeah I said let's go cheap,ep036
1320,world is perfect yeah I could see myself,ep036
1323,in smashed and hanging out out here yeah,ep036
1326,I mean we don't have the value our space,ep036
1329,in our unit but we have this shared area,ep036
1332,I see that there's a patio over there -,ep036
1335,probably Bry overall this place takes,ep036
1338,most of the boxes that we're looking for,ep036
1341,within budget it has a nice pool for,ep036
1344,Sarah and it's supposed to post to my,ep036
1347,work it's ideal I would however like a,ep036
1350,little bit more space the space inside,ep036
1353,was a bit cramped I mean I love the pool,ep036
1356,area and love how fancy this is for me I,ep036
1359,would love three bedrooms yeah but I,ep036
1362,think we can make the space work just be,ep036
1365,a little efficient feels pretty stuck on,ep036
1368,his budget no no Sarah once that space,ep036
1371,so it's gonna be a give-and-take see who,ep036
1374,who wants their wrestling match three,ep036
1377,beds two baths I just think we would be,ep036
1380,so much more comfortable there but it's,ep036
1383,farthest away from work sorry,ep036
1386,sure you settle down yep great day for a,ep036
1389,picnic bill Sarah and baby Sebastian are,ep036
1392,leaving Philly for the sub-saharan City,ep036
1395,of Johannesburg,ep036
1398,I figured let's just pile on all the,ep036
1401,life changes at one time Sarah's nervous,ep036
1404,she'll be cramped with baby Sebastian if,ep036
1407,bill doesn't loosen up on the budget I'm,ep036
1410,afraid to ask how much it costs that's,ep036
1413,not a big deal I mean look at the space,ep036
1416,there's always gonna be some cost,ep036
1419,involved and moving across the world the,ep036
1422,modern townhouse I think was the best,ep036
1425,conference,ep036
1428,it wasn't the closest to my work but it,ep036
1431,wasn't too far away either and it has,ep036
1434,the only one with a built-in bride but,ep036
1437,only two bedrooms it's a two-bedroom,ep036
1440,two-bath right and it's right on budget,ep036
1443,"at 1,800 no pool no third bedroom I was",ep036
1446,hoping for something a lot,ep036
1449,the garden house was the most spacious,ep036
1452,both indoor and outdoor what all the,ep036
1455,space I know it's just so far away from,ep036
1458,work and we're going down to one income,ep036
1461,so I'd really like to stay on budget,ep036
1464,so we have rugs and a girl supply and,ep036
1467,we're budget okay so there's the,ep036
1470,apartment of the city center I think the,ep036
1473,city townhouse satisfies our top,ep036
1476,priorities very small it was a little,ep036
1479,small,ep036
1482,it has your pool and it's close to work,ep036
1485,let's not forget it's under budget,ep036
1488,I think Bill's trying to get me to like,ep036
1491,this because he just likes the price of,ep036
1494,this apartment,ep036
1497,[Music],ep036
1500,I'm thinking we should eliminate the,ep036
1503,modern town really just really wasn't,ep036
1506,feeling the front area it's the only one,ep036
1509,with a bride sorry all right,ep036
1512,I said we're coming from all right,ep036
1515,eliminate that one Bonz that was done,ep036
1518,you're right I mean the fake grass was I,ep036
1521,didn't like the fake grass at all the,ep036
1524,garden townhouse was amazing,ep036
1527,three beds two baths everyone can have,ep036
1530,their own area I mean that's all true,ep036
1533,but it's the farthest away from work and,ep036
1536,it's over budget the city center,ep036
1539,apartment really nice complex really,ep036
1542,fancy upscale you had the pool and it's,ep036
1545,close to my work so I can spend more,ep036
1548,time there but the Guardian townhouse,ep036
1551,had so much more space sure it was a,ep036
1554,little over budget and a little farther,ep036
1557,from your work but Sebastian I'll be,ep036
1560,spending a lot of time there while,ep036
1563,you're on the road I just think we would,ep036
1566,be so much more comfortable there yeah,ep036
1569,it doesn't have a pool but can't believe,ep036
1572,I'm saying this but I might sacrifice,ep036
1575,the pool I think I know which one we,ep036
1578,should get but I just want to remind you,ep036
1581,of one thing I did win the maze it's,ep036
1584,true but I know that you did move here,ep036
1587,and give up your your job and you gave,ep036
1590,up sacrificed a lot coming here mm-hmm I,ep036
1593,mean nobody's spending a lot of time in,ep036
1596,traffic but if it means that that you're,ep036
1599,you and Sebastian are really enjoying,ep036
1602,the the outdoor space I could I could,ep036
1605,see us going over budget for that yeah I,ep036
1608,think I know what I want garden,ep036
1611,townhouse guy in town house,ep036
1614,[Music],ep036
1617,don't you want your food,ep036
1620,we're so happy with life in Johannesburg,ep036
1623,it's been really easy to settle into a,ep036
1626,nice life here I was working two weeks,ep036
1629,after she was born you made a lot of,ep036
1632,friends have a good group of mom friends,ep036
1635,which I was some I was worried about,ep036
1638,coming over here but suddenly and just,ep036
1641,fine I think it was worth it to go over,ep036
1644,a budget I'm so comfortable in this,ep036
1647,place Sebastian and I have so much space,ep036
1650,to play around and relax and it's bless,ep036
1653,you this place doesn't have a pool but,ep036
1656,it's really not a big deal just down the,ep036
1659,road is a public pool where Sebastian,ep036
1662,and I are taking some lessons Bill's,ep036
1665,become quite the prime master I must say,ep036
1668,it smells great,ep036
1671,oh it's gonna be delicious Johannesburg,ep036
1674,has far exceeded our expectations,ep036
1677,there's such a vibrant city few friends,ep036
1680,yeah he loves your hands right,ep036
12,[Music],ep037
15,this gorgeous the ceilings are so tall,ep037
18,Richard and Elise are looking for their,ep037
21,dream house on Sanibel Island off,ep037
24,Florida's Gulf Coast oh look you can see,ep037
27,the ocean from our porch her idea of,ep037
30,paradise is to be living right on the,ep037
33,beach,ep037
36,I would rather be looking out at the,ep037
39,ocean and being able to hear the waves,ep037
42,while we're late I surely would but,ep037
45,you'd be laying hill hearing the waves,ep037
48,coming up going,ep037
51,while his dream involves a pool in the,ep037
54,back and a private boat dock take me,ep037
57,down show me the pool I can show you the,ep037
60,yard honey and the space for a pool the,ep037
63,wall doesn't know it's your dream oh I,ep037
66,can't have the beach at least you can,ep037
69,have your boat dock,ep037
72,[Music],ep037
75,look this is a core probably of a banded,ep037
78,tulip or a clump I'm Richard and I own a,ep037
81,software company I'm Elise and I'm a,ep037
84,real estate agent they met after Richard,ep037
87,moved from England to Orlando and wanted,ep037
90,to buy a house but once she'd helped him,ep037
93,do that their relationship became,ep037
96,personal a couple months later I had,ep037
99,sent him a thank-you note and then he,ep037
102,ended up asking me out right after that,ep037
105,I thought she was super cute but I,ep037
108,didn't think she'd be interested in me,ep037
111,he was just so engaging and so fun we,ep037
114,just had such a great time that it just,ep037
117,immediately turned into so much more,ep037
120,the rest is history we're getting,ep037
123,married in a couple months since they,ep037
126,both work from home they have the,ep037
129,flexibility to live anywhere in Florida,ep037
132,they want so after being in Orlando for,ep037
135,the last two years they've sold his,ep037
138,house and are looking for a place here,ep037
141,on Sanibel Island my mom used to come,ep037
144,here on vacation and it was her very,ep037
147,very favorite place in the entire world,ep037
150,and I lost my mom about six months ago,ep037
153,very suddenly we decided after the loss,ep037
156,of my mom's to get married here and,ep037
159,that's what originally brought us to,ep037
162,Sanibel and we just fell in love with,ep037
165,seeing the ball from the moment we,ep037
168,arrived you know the names of all these,ep037
171,shows all of them but my mom taught me a,ep037
174,couple of them like this one's a kitten,ep037
177,pop see how cute one of my mom's,ep037
180,favorite things was shelling and Sanibel,ep037
183,is well known for being the number one,ep037
186,place in the United States for shelling,ep037
189,you've got dolphins in the water you've,ep037
192,got boats everywhere the water is just,ep037
195,beautiful they've agreed on a budget of,ep037
198,"$800,000 for their new house but they",ep037
201,haven't come to terms on what style,ep037
204,they're looking for I grew up in,ep037
207,California so I always had that,ep037
210,contemporary Malibu style beach house in,ep037
213,my dreams I love modern look inside and,ep037
216,just nice and sleek so this is more the,ep037
219,traditional style I was kind of thinking,ep037
222,of the kind of style of home that I'm,ep037
225,really looking for is something a little,ep037
228,more traditional I think because of my,ep037
231,background symmetrical in terms of doors,ep037
234,and windows but you're really our one,ep037
237,room for everything,ep037
240,I like big open spaces so light bright,ep037
243,airy I'd really like to find a house,ep037
246,with defined space with defined rooms,ep037
249,they'd all have to shout at you if I,ep037
252,need something if I'm in another room,ep037
255,they both want room for an office they,ep037
258,can share plus a garage for storage,ep037
261,Annalise has her heart set on a white,ep037
264,kitchen I love a nice clean modern,ep037
267,kitchen with marble countertops I,ep037
270,definitely want my cabinets to be white,ep037
273,these how's it gonna have not a,ep037
276,beautiful pose but I really think the,ep037
279,requirement for a pool is really big for,ep037
282,me it's something that you just I,ep037
285,haven't been able to have living back in,ep037
288,England so we had a pool in our lando,ep037
291,house and how many times do we use their,ep037
294,pool we didn't swim in the pool too much,ep037
297,this is true but it's not all about just,ep037
300,swimming in the pool,ep037
303,I love the sitting out by the pool it,ep037
306,just gives that feel of being closer to,ep037
309,the water I mean I'd love to just have,ep037
312,my boat on the back of one of these we,ep037
315,do own a boat and I know that's,ep037
318,something really important to return is,ep037
321,to have a boat dock just to be able to,ep037
324,go out of our back yard and onto the,ep037
327,water the only thing is is being on the,ep037
330,canal if you're a little bit further,ep037
333,from the beach so a night like my dream,ep037
336,of moving to the beach is actually,ep037
339,moving to the beach I want to be able to,ep037
342,hear the waves at night you can buy the,ep037
345,recordings of it that is not gonna be,ep037
348,good enough for our new house since,ep037
351,Elise is acting as their agent,ep037
354,she's starting them off in a location,ep037
357,she prefers on the west side of the,ep037
360,island close to the beach today's house,ep037
363,is a half duplex which means there's two,ep037
366,different owners on each side obviously,ep037
369,there's no garage with this property,ep037
372,like I know you really wanted but there,ep037
375,is the carport and there is the storage,ep037
378,down here so I think it's a good,ep037
381,compromise this whole half would be ours,ep037
384,and then that is all our neighbor so,ep037
387,like us neighbor correct you go yes,ep037
390,close huh yeah but the good news is it's,ep037
393,6:59 so well below budget then well,ep037
396,below budget six hundred fifty nine,ep037
399,thousand dollars is a great price,ep037
402,because the average price on the island,ep037
405,"is about 850,000 Oh",ep037
408,you can see the ocean from our porch,ep037
411,it's kind of a narrow view through,ep037
414,though no it's better than nothing right,ep037
417,by the beach exactly where I wanted to,ep037
420,be I bet you can hear the waves at night,ep037
423,oh I love it,ep037
426,it's so open and airy I like the flow of,ep037
429,the kitchen but it definitely needs new,ep037
432,cabinets it needs new appliances,ep037
435,definitely countertops smaller we cook,ep037
438,and then dining room and then when we're,ep037
441,finished living room I just like it to,ep037
444,be a bit more separated in the living,ep037
447,space but I think it could work for us I,ep037
450,mean it's just the two of us I would,ep037
453,definitely give up space for location i,ep037
456,think proximity to the beach is,ep037
459,something that is number one on my wish,ep037
462,list we can change the inside all we,ep037
465,want but we cannot change where this,ep037
468,house is I love this outdoor patio this,ep037
471,is almost like having another living,ep037
474,room out here isn't it absolutely this,ep037
477,is probably where we'd spend more of our,ep037
480,time now that changes that inside space,ep037
483,we don't need the dining space to be in,ep037
486,there we can have our dining space out,ep037
489,here honey it's a pretty good size out,ep037
492,here and the pool is the pool,ep037
495,non-existent a giant saltwater pool that,ep037
498,is about 500 yards that way yeah the,ep037
501,beach what about some boat dock yeah no,ep037
504,boat dock either honey we'd have to run,ep037
507,a slip at the marina it's a trade-off,ep037
510,we're gonna have to find compromises,ep037
513,somewhere they head back inside to see,ep037
516,the guest bedroom this kid yeah I like,ep037
519,the vaulted ceiling you've got to have a,ep037
522,spare room right because everyone comes,ep037
525,to visit so where do we work good point,ep037
528,I mean we could work in that small room,ep037
531,out the back but then we lost it the,ep037
534,Banyan Sports office though they see the,ep037
537,full bathroom next to the guest bedroom,ep037
540,then head to the master it looks exactly,ep037
543,the same as the yeah it's a mirror that,ep037
546,again right it doesn't feel like a,ep037
549,master bedroom it's not grand has an,ep037
552,ensuite yep well it's very small and,ep037
555,very green it's like 80s fake marble,ep037
558,countertop we definitely would need to,ep037
561,do an entire renovation in here yeah,ep037
564,I think this is the closest we're gonna,ep037
567,get to the beach in our price range it's,ep037
570,kind of small though,ep037
573,you think I think the bedrooms and the,ep037
576,bathrooms are really small I love the,ep037
579,big open-concept living room I love the,ep037
582,outdoor space facing out the back is,ep037
585,good but then we would have to use it as,ep037
588,office space we would no pool no no dog,ep037
591,I think on the island we should be able,ep037
594,to get those things but then we're just,ep037
597,sacrificing where it's gonna be further,ep037
600,away from the beach to get those other,ep037
603,things those are the things I want but,ep037
606,what about what I want now to keep,ep037
609,things happy in the home Elyse has found,ep037
612,a place that she thinks will be perfect,ep037
615,for Richard but this is the house that,ep037
618,is slightly over budget which is how,ep037
621,much cycling around sand falls with my,ep037
624,favorite thing if we move here we can do,ep037
627,this every day Richard and Elise are,ep037
630,looking to move from Orlando to Sanibel,ep037
633,Island on Florida's Gulf Coast we can,ep037
636,cycle to lunch we can cycle to cooking,ep037
639,ice cream ice cream let's go get ice,ep037
642,cream okay now I'll race you with eight,ep037
645,hundred thousand dollars to spend on a,ep037
648,place to live they've seen a half duplex,ep037
651,on the west side of the island that was,ep037
654,just steps from the beach exactly what,ep037
657,Elise wants but it didn't have a pool or,ep037
660,a boat dock for Richard,ep037
663,so now Elise who's a real estate agent,ep037
666,has picked out a house on the east side,ep037
669,of the island that she hopes Richard,ep037
672,will like oh this is beautiful,ep037
675,so this is the house that is slightly,ep037
678,over budget which is how much eight,ep037
681,hundred and ninety nine thousand that's,ep037
684,not slightly over budget well look at,ep037
687,how cute it is it's not contemporary so,ep037
690,it's not my style at all but it's,ep037
693,totally exactly what you are like it is,ep037
696,exactly what I'm looking for where's the,ep037
699,garage there's no garage so I think that,ep037
702,if we were to buy this house it would,ep037
705,definitely be a challenge to put all of,ep037
708,our outdoor items somewhere okyou,ep037
711,entryway nice it's got some storage here,ep037
714,oh my goodness this is gorgeous the,ep037
717,ceilings are so tall this is beautiful,ep037
720,so this would be the main living room,ep037
723,right yes what is that it's like shells,ep037
726,like shells which is perfect for Santa,ep037
729,Bell okay so what's this over here then,ep037
732,this would be dining room I guess at,ep037
735,least likes the open concept of this,ep037
738,kind of house I'm not so sure for me I,ep037
741,like the rooms to be more separated and,ep037
744,more distinct I love the open feel of,ep037
747,this kitchen but I am NOT the biggest,ep037
750,fan of the retro style I love the retro,ep037
753,style I love the work surfaces it feels,ep037
756,like it's a table at a 1950s diner what,ep037
759,do you think do you think we could put,ep037
762,maybe put in marble countertops no I,ep037
765,like these you're talking about invested,ep037
768,in new countertops on a house that's,ep037
771,over budget well then what's a couple,ep037
774,thousand dollars on marble on top that's,ep037
777,not happening they see a full bathroom,ep037
780,off the kitchen this is charming and two,ep037
783,bedrooms one of which they could use as,ep037
786,an office but the next room is a bit of,ep037
789,a mystery there's a bathroom right here,ep037
792,but the bathrooms like double doors,ep037
795,opens onto it but I like here I mean the,ep037
798,tiles are nice yeah so what's through,ep037
801,that room then that's the master through,ep037
804,there so this isn't the master batten oh,ep037
807,this is the second living space that,ep037
810,they're listing was talking about in the,ep037
813,middle of the house yes oh this is huge,ep037
816,it here I'm so glad this is the master,ep037
819,and not that out there the views I mean,ep037
822,it's very tropical in green but like I,ep037
825,would rather be looking out at the ocean,ep037
828,and being able to hear the waves while,ep037
831,we're late I'm sure you would but you'd,ep037
834,be laying hill hearing the waves coming,ep037
837,up going another million another minute,ep037
840,that's what they'll do through to the,ep037
843,definitely the master bathroom master,ep037
846,bathroom this marble is here finally I,ep037
849,get like a two-by-two section that's not,ep037
852,yet what do you think of this this is,ep037
855,really cute it's really cute no space,ep037
858,there's no counter space there's no,ep037
861,storage space we'd be to change it out,ep037
864,for something more functional where does,ep037
867,that come from if we've already,ep037
870,overspent we will make it work,ep037
873,we'll make you mad okay they head out,ep037
876,back through the screened-in porch to,ep037
879,the pool area I love it,ep037
882,it is our own pool true yes you will huh,ep037
885,you can clean whatever you want it's,ep037
888,just to be have a sweep up and a clean,ep037
891,air okay then if it's that easy then,ep037
894,it's all you but guess what these down,ep037
897,here it's your dream Oh have the beach,ep037
900,at least you can have your boat dock,ep037
903,this canal goes all the way through,ep037
906,through the marina out to the,ep037
909,intercoastal okay I'm happy it's,ep037
912,definitely not my style and especially,ep037
915,like the kitchen I think the outside of,ep037
918,the house on the curb appeal is just,ep037
921,fantastic yeah yeah this is eight,ep037
924,hundred and ninety nine thousand dollars,ep037
927,and we have no real storage for this,ep037
930,house I mean there's not even a storage,ep037
933,shed in the backyard,ep037
936,we're not as near to the beach as you'd,ep037
939,like to be that is very true so I'd,ep037
942,really maybe like to go see something a,ep037
945,little bit closer to the sands okay so,ep037
948,now she's found a place that's just a,ep037
951,3-minute walk from the beach,ep037
954,not only do you get the beach but you,ep037
957,get some exercise on the way there uh,ep037
960,yeah,ep037
963,[Music],ep037
966,yeah nice boats are gorgeous there's so,ep037
969,many nice place I love that real estate,ep037
972,agent Elise and her fiancé Richard have,ep037
975,"a budget of $800,000 for a house on",ep037
978,Sanibel Island in Florida he's hoping,ep037
981,for a place on a canal with a boat dock,ep037
984,in the back but she wants to be as close,ep037
987,to the beach as she can get we looked a,ep037
990,little bit small for this boat slip,ep037
993,don't you think Oh it'll be fine so far,ep037
996,they've seen a half duplex that's close,ep037
999,enough to the beach to hear the waves,ep037
1002,but it didn't have a boat dock or the,ep037
1005,pool that Richard wants then they saw a,ep037
1008,house on a canal with a boat dock and a,ep037
1011,pool but it wasn't close to the beach,ep037
1014,plus it was over their budget so now,ep037
1017,she's lined up another option for them,ep037
1020,to see this is more the kind of thing I,ep037
1023,was thinking yeah it's a lot more,ep037
1026,traditional for you I knew you'd like it,ep037
1029,I think it's a little plain I just feel,ep037
1032,like it's lacking character the garage,ep037
1035,space is really nice Josh it's nice so,ep037
1038,it's three bedrooms two bathrooms on the,ep037
1041,market for six hundred and eighty nine,ep037
1044,thousand dollars Wow,ep037
1047,that seems really raised well for this,ep037
1050,the best thing is we're about three,ep037
1053,minute walk to the beach Oh three,ep037
1056,minutes is good yeah so we're just,ep037
1059,getting a little bit more house for our,ep037
1062,money going only do you get the beach,ep037
1065,but you get some exercise on the way,ep037
1068,there ah yeah after you,ep037
1071,oh wow I love the open concept but I,ep037
1074,know that once again it's all kind of in,ep037
1077,in one room I like the floor it's not,ep037
1080,tired is it no it's actually a vinyl,ep037
1083,it's nice and neutral yeah it's okay the,ep037
1086,only thing this is see it's a bit it's,ep037
1089,hope it's small I mean that's it you,ep037
1092,know it's a the area is not that big I,ep037
1095,think it could work because we don't,ep037
1098,spend a ton of time inside I really,ep037
1101,really love the overall feel in this,ep037
1104,room the kitchen seems to be a pretty,ep037
1107,good size yeah yeah it's the kitchen you,ep037
1110,were talking about it's the white,ep037
1113,kitchen a white kitchen yes not my,ep037
1116,marble countertops but we can always,ep037
1119,change that out is so far below budget,ep037
1122,oh my gosh look at the view out of the,ep037
1125,window yeah you're gonna enjoy doing the,ep037
1128,dishes in here that's not happening,ep037
1131,we'll see about that,ep037
1134,nice so let's take you this is you out,ep037
1137,this is really amazing out here oh this,ep037
1140,is this is so pretty I love this view,ep037
1143,it's not the ocean but for 689 thousand,ep037
1146,we're not gonna get the ocean,ep037
1149,second-best exactly so take me down show,ep037
1152,me the pool oh well I can show you the,ep037
1155,yard honey and the space for a pool that,ep037
1158,almost sounds like you're saying there,ep037
1161,is no pool,ep037
1164,unfortunately we'd have to put a pool in,ep037
1167,but there's so much space to put a pool,ep037
1170,back here yeah there is can we have a,ep037
1173,dock we could put a kayak in and kayak,ep037
1176,around but other than that no okay have,ep037
1179,you paddle fast enough I'll get up on my,ep037
1182,whiteboard perfect perfect back inside,ep037
1185,they see a bedroom for guests a full,ep037
1188,bathroom and another bedroom they could,ep037
1191,use us in office then it's on to the,ep037
1194,master oh wow this is really pretty like,ep037
1197,this it's a great size I that view that,ep037
1200,view is just gorgeous,ep037
1203,to have that view for your master course,ep037
1206,is not bad it's not as grand as I would,ep037
1209,have hoped for but I really like the,ep037
1212,vanity actually a lot yep and it does,ep037
1215,have the double sink the double sinks,ep037
1218,he's really good I just think it's tight,ep037
1221,in here like I mean we'll have to do,ep037
1224,some like should I see Dad it should be,ep037
1227,yeah these taps are really good yeah are,ep037
1230,they mean the faucet the taps yeah,ep037
1233,there we go English versus English I,ep037
1236,think over I like but there's a reason,ep037
1239,why it's called English we know that,ep037
1242,don't we,ep037
1245,cuz it's hard goodness don't get me,ep037
1248,started,ep037
1251,[Music],ep037
1254,I like the space I like the garages,ep037
1257,downstairs the garages are extensive I,ep037
1260,really like the view and then I really,ep037
1263,like the traditional style of the house,ep037
1266,I know you do but unfortunately that is,ep037
1269,not a selling point for me but I love,ep037
1272,the backyard and the fact that we could,ep037
1275,put in a pool and really make the space,ep037
1278,our own and it's within budget it's only,ep037
1281,six hundred and eighty nine thousand I'm,ep037
1284,thinking at this price point if we can,ep037
1287,put a great pool in Richard will forget,ep037
1290,about the dock after seeing several,ep037
1293,options their choice won't be easy since,ep037
1296,no house can work perfectly for both of,ep037
1299,them it may come down to who wins the,ep037
1302,beach versus boat dock battle let's take,ep037
1305,a walk on the beach and have a think,ep037
1308,okay sounds good to me,ep037
1311,[Music],ep037
1314,Richard and Elise are house hunting on,ep037
1317,Florida's Sanibel Island with an,ep037
1320,"$800,000 budget I can't believe we're",ep037
1323,finally gonna be moving to the islands,ep037
1326,and picking our dream house oh no,ep037
1329,they've seen several possibilities now,ep037
1332,they're ready to choose so what do you,ep037
1335,think about the first house that we saw,ep037
1338,half duplex a half to play I really love,ep037
1341,"the price 650 $9,000 from the front",ep037
1344,porch you can see the ocean and I love,ep037
1347,that so much it was really small two,ep037
1350,bedrooms two bathrooms,ep037
1353,it was pretty view from the back though,ep037
1356,but no pool no boat dock basically it's,ep037
1359,just close to the gives you the beach,ep037
1362,though I know they know we've got the,ep037
1365,second which was gorgeous but the price,ep037
1368,"the price $9,000 that's so far over",ep037
1371,where we want it we are gonna have no,ep037
1374,storage,ep037
1377,no storage at all no garage for me I,ep037
1380,mean it's got the pool and it's got the,ep037
1383,dock if it was the ocean we'd be so if,ep037
1386,it was the ocean we couldn't afford it,ep037
1389,what about this the third house,ep037
1392,exceptional prospect it's got the it's,ep037
1395,got three garages I really like,ep037
1398,size of the kitchen I felt like the the,ep037
1401,white cabinets were perfect,ep037
1404,I wish the water had been more than a,ep037
1407,pond right no poor no boat duck,ep037
1410,we could put exactly the pool we wanted,ep037
1413,in that house so we've got to make a,ep037
1416,decision that I know which one you want,ep037
1419,and it's the same one that I want if,ep037
1422,it's the same one that you want we're,ep037
1425,gonna have a boat dock I love the big,ep037
1428,open airy spaces that it has so what,ep037
1431,we're gonna just bite the bullet,ep037
1434,we know the budget on this outside yeah,ep037
1437,get negotiating we need to get to get,ep037
1440,that prize to hell I might what did the,ep037
1443,sand come from,ep037
1446,so this sand my mom and I collected when,ep037
1449,we were on her toe Rico we closed about,ep037
1452,two months ago and we moved in on day,ep037
1455,one and then all of these shells we got,ep037
1458,when we visited the Virgin Islands the,ep037
1461,list price on this house was 899,ep037
1464,thousand through at least his amazing,ep037
1467,negotiation managed to get the house 50,ep037
1470,to 500,ep037
1473,I definitely sacrifice on the proximity,ep037
1476,to the beach but I love this room so,ep037
1479,much I love the big open space even,ep037
1482,though there are some more defined,ep037
1485,spaces in this room it's still open,ep037
1488,concept you wanted the beach I brought,ep037
1491,the beach to me all of my mom's shells,ep037
1494,and my shell collection just fits so,ep037
1497,perfectly in here what do you think I,ep037
1500,think it looks fantastic that's good huh,ep037
1503,yeah where'd you want to go to let's go,ep037
1506,up to cabbage key and have lunch all,ep037
1509,right having a boat at the back of the,ep037
1512,house where you walk out step on the,ep037
1515,boat and away you go,ep037
1518,is just a dream it's awesome I will,ep037
1521,admit I do love having the boat dock I,ep037
1524,love to see our house from here the,ep037
1527,backyard is so cute yeah it's so pretty,ep037
1530,from here surprise surprise we have not,ep037
1533,yet used the pool and we've been here,ep037
1536,for two months I guess we might as well,ep037
1539,sit out by the pool since we're not,ep037
1542,gonna swim in the pool I've used it to,ep037
1545,look at to sit and you've used it to,ep037
1548,clean at the moment is doing almost,ep037
1551,everything I wanted it to know what I'm,ep037
1554,gonna do I'm gonna thread,ep037
1557,some cafe lights across here before our,ep037
1560,wedding we're doing a big barbecue with,ep037
1563,all of our wedding guests so we're just,ep037
1566,really excited to have this house filled,ep037
1569,with all the people that we love and you,ep037
1572,know they're gonna be here into the,ep037
1575,early hours of the morning probably,ep037
1578,anyway sorry neighbors yeah they are,ep037
1581,half of them are English after all yeah,ep037
1584,this is true to be on Sanibel I feel,ep037
1587,very connected to my mom because this,ep037
1590,was her favorite place to be I'm here,ep037
1593,with my dream man in my dream house and,ep037
1596,in our dream location so it couldn't get,ep037
1599,any better,ep037
12,oh wow look at that a dedicated,ep038
15,sunbathing deck Michelle and Arnold are,ep038
18,expecting their first child so they're,ep038
21,looking for a new home in Tampa Florida,ep038
24,she wants tons of vintage charm actually,ep038
27,it's a 1920s bungalow I really like that,ep038
30,it's cozy this is exactly what I had,ep038
33,envisioned when I had front porch in,ep038
36,mind he'd rather have the ease and,ep038
39,sleekness of a modern downtown condo I,ep038
42,really like the shower there's a clear,ep038
45,glass door which I can I like it's not,ep038
48,really my style but for their budget,ep038
51,style isn't the only compromise they may,ep038
54,find themselves making this house has a,ep038
57,lot of the original floors and a lot of,ep038
60,the original details but with that comes,ep038
63,some slanted floors it's quite us I'm,ep038
66,not sure it really functions as a closet,ep038
69,yeah I would need to hang my clothes on,ep038
72,something,ep038
75,[Music],ep038
78,we should probably pick up some of this,ep038
81,rainbow chard that looks beautiful,ep038
84,my name is Michelle I'm a speech,ep038
87,pathologist my name is Arnold I'm an,ep038
90,internal medicine hospitalist what about,ep038
93,some asparagus okay let's get some,ep038
96,asparagus real those two those look nice,ep038
99,I met Arnold when I went to grad school,ep038
102,I placed an ad online looking for a,ep038
105,roommate and he answered my ad we did,ep038
108,the survey so we kind of like knew that,ep038
111,we had certain qualities that line up so,ep038
114,you know like early to bed yes,ep038
117,cleanliness early to rise you know,ep038
120,obviously in med school I'll even be,ep038
123,very focused I was looking for someone,ep038
126,who went party yeah should we get some,ep038
129,microgreens too I think I actually kind,ep038
132,of knew that I was gonna marry him we,ep038
135,transitioned from roommates to I don't,ep038
138,even know what you call it but we,ep038
141,consolidated rooms within six months now,ep038
144,married they live in downtown Tampa and,ep038
147,have really enjoyed watching the area,ep038
150,gain new life when we first moved here I,ep038
153,knew that there's a urban renewal,ep038
156,process going on and it was literally,ep038
159,being torn up and rebuild and it's,ep038
162,really developed a lot the Riverwalk has,ep038
165,played a really important part and it's,ep038
168,just been really great to see the whole,ep038
171,thing develop yeah you could say that,ep038
174,we're never really bored down here we,ep038
177,can also stop and have a drink well at,ep038
180,least I can right I won't participate,ep038
183,I'll watch you and now that they're,ep038
186,expecting their first child they want,ep038
189,something bigger than their current,ep038
192,two-bedroom condo I think that we both,ep038
195,agree that we need at least three,ep038
198,bedrooms now but I think the hard part,ep038
201,is that he wants to stay in the urban,ep038
204,environment but I'm ready to actually,ep038
207,get outside of the urban environment and,ep038
210,have a little bit more quiet,ep038
213,I've been living in an urban condo for,ep038
216,at least nine years you know that it's,ep038
219,really part of my life and lifestyle and,ep038
222,so I'm used to very loud busy walking,ep038
225,places and so you know I want to remain,ep038
228,in the urban environment,ep038
231,I definitely like a more modern condo,ep038
234,high-rise I like things that are low,ep038
237,maintenance and that are sleek smooth,ep038
240,I'm kind of in the nesting mode so if I,ep038
243,were all by myself buying this house,ep038
246,then I would go straight to a bungalow,ep038
249,an older house when it would be very,ep038
252,cute and charming my dream home would,ep038
255,have a porch I can really see ourselves,ep038
258,sitting out on the porch and watching,ep038
261,our kids grow what do you want me to,ep038
264,make for dinner tonight some of that,ep038
267,organic quinoa pasta sounds good okay,ep038
270,how about some homemade spaghetti yeah,ep038
273,and we can get fresh garlic for in the,ep038
276,marinara sauce I spend most of my time,ep038
279,in the kitchen I prepare all of our food,ep038
282,from scratch so I need a nice big,ep038
285,kitchen,ep038
288,a nice big workspace and with a lot of,ep038
291,storage they both agree on a big master,ep038
294,with space to put a crib a fireplace and,ep038
297,a large dining room,ep038
300,something with tons of natural light is,ep038
303,also a must it's an important part for,ep038
306,me because in the hospital you don't,ep038
309,really get to see the daylight a lot and,ep038
312,so when I come home I want that you know,ep038
315,sunlight and that natural light and,ep038
318,speaking of sunlight Michelle insists on,ep038
321,a private place to sunbathe if we do get,ep038
324,a house we won't have to share the,ep038
327,sunbathing deck I won't have to fight,ep038
330,anyone for a lounge chair I think you,ep038
333,also want a space for a girl I,ep038
336,absolutely love drilling so that's,ep038
339,important to me we don't want to go over,ep038
342,475 for our budget I think that we'll be,ep038
345,able to get a lot more for our money if,ep038
348,we move outside of downtown I'm hoping,ep038
351,that if we look hard enough that maybe,ep038
354,we'll be able to find something we're,ep038
357,net even with the child that we can have,ep038
360,enough space to remain in the urban,ep038
363,environment,ep038
366,first up they head out to see a home,ep038
369,about ten minutes north of downtown,ep038
372,Tampa hey Nicole,ep038
375,how's it going it's going good what do,ep038
378,you think of the neighborhood I love the,ep038
381,neighborhood and love the street yeah,ep038
384,yeah it's really pretty isn't it yeah,ep038
387,we're in some Hill Heights today which,ep038
390,is one of Tampa's earliest suburbs yeah,ep038
393,you know how I feel about some of us,ep038
396,"this house is about 2,100 square feet",ep038
399,"and it's listed for 400,000 which is a",ep038
402,really great price for that much space,ep038
405,mm-hmm,ep038
408,can I see that there are two porches yes,ep038
411,so this house was probably originally,ep038
414,built in 1925 as a single storey,ep038
417,bungalow at some point they did an,ep038
420,addition so now you have upstairs and a,ep038
423,downstairs front porch this is exactly,ep038
426,what I had envisioned when I had front,ep038
429,porch in mind yeah it's really pretty,ep038
432,isn't it yeah come on in,ep038
435,this must be the living room it is what,ep038
438,do you think the light is good yes,ep038
441,is that a functioning fireplace it is,ep038
444,that's a wood-burning fireplace okay and,ep038
447,there's lots of original detail in this,ep038
450,living room I really like that it's cozy,ep038
453,good I'm glad you like it you've got a,ep038
456,dining room area over here mm-hmm,ep038
459,that seems a little small I'm not sure,ep038
462,if I were table would fit in here yeah,ep038
465,this just seems pretty tight there's,ep038
468,like kind of a lack of a flow through,ep038
471,with this define wall,ep038
474,I don't know how functional this space,ep038
477,is for us with a growing family you do,ep038
480,have a large kitchen over here mm-hmm,ep038
483,not sure about these floors it's unusual,ep038
486,isn't it brick,ep038
489,this was probably a porch at one point,ep038
492,so it's got a nice herringbone pattern,ep038
495,in it now but there's definitely a,ep038
498,farmhouse take in this kitchen which is,ep038
501,in style right now I could see myself,ep038
504,cooking and baking in here okay,ep038
507,you've also got two bedrooms on the,ep038
510,first floor oh they're right this way,ep038
513,okay they take a look at the downstairs,ep038
516,bedrooms then head upstairs to see,ep038
519,another bedroom before making their way,ep038
522,to the master suite Oh a fireplace yeah,ep038
525,that's nice right yeah pretty good size,ep038
528,yeah it's a huge huge bedroom yeah you,ep038
531,like it,ep038
534,so full disclosure I want to show you,ep038
537,guys something,ep038
540,this house has a lot of the original,ep038
543,floors and a lot of the original details,ep038
546,but with that comes some slanted floors,ep038
549,Wow it's one of the perks of an old home,ep038
552,is all of the quirks including slanty,ep038
555,floors so I think that I could probably,ep038
558,live with it,ep038
561,I know Michelle loves the charm of these,ep038
564,old homes but and there is a practical,ep038
567,sense this is a cool space,ep038
570,this could function is the little,ep038
573,nursery yep you could put a baby's,ep038
576,bassinet in this room mm-hmm I like it,ep038
579,and over here you've got a huge bathroom,ep038
582,fully renovated Wow I like the tile,ep038
585,that's huge it's a really cool shower I,ep038
588,think it's really nice they head back,ep038
591,downstairs to the backyard this is an,ep038
594,interesting porch it's half done yeah,ep038
597,this backyard definitely needs some work,ep038
600,yeah the yard seems a little bit too,ep038
603,shaded almost you know like there would,ep038
606,be no place to sunbathe yeah and I'm not,ep038
609,sure where I'd put my girl yeah with,ep038
612,this yard you'd pretty much be starting,ep038
615,over from scratch so it's really the,ep038
618,house that is the appealing part of this,ep038
621,property true I really did like that,ep038
624,there are two front porches that's a,ep038
627,huge bonus yeah I really like the,ep038
630,historical charm and I really like that,ep038
633,there are two fireplaces especially the,ep038
636,one in the master suite yeah that's so,ep038
639,pretty yeah I was actually kind of,ep038
642,surprised I liked the bathroom so we're,ep038
645,kind of modern but old at the same time,ep038
648,the bedroom was pretty big but I was,ep038
651,concerned that the floors are really,ep038
654,slanted although it has charm it's kind,ep038
657,of old and I'm worried about maintenance,ep038
660,on this place so they head out to take a,ep038
663,look at something more modern for Arnold,ep038
666,but there's a catch there are actually,ep038
669,no three bedrooms available in your,ep038
672,price range in downtown Tampa,ep038
675,[Music],ep038
678,plot some of this fruit yeah looks yummy,ep038
681,this Tampa couple is looking to move out,ep038
684,of their downtown condo and into,ep038
687,something larger within their four,ep038
690,hundred and seventy five thousand dollar,ep038
693,budget so far they've seen a charming,ep038
696,well priced bungalow in a historic,ep038
699,neighborhood perfect for Michelle but,ep038
702,Arnold has his heart set on a home,ep038
705,that's more modern and in an urban area,ep038
708,so now their agents lined up a place she,ep038
711,thinks Arnold will like okay and even,ep038
714,though he prefers staying in Tampa their,ep038
717,agent thinks another location will work,ep038
720,what's the address,ep038
723,it's eight one North in fact she's,ep038
726,sending them out to nearby st. Pete so,ep038
729,she thinks it could work as well,ep038
732,balut is being calculated all right,ep038
735,[Music],ep038
738,hey guys how's it going Noah nice hi,ep038
741,yeah you like it the only thing is it's,ep038
744,in CP that's the only a little odd thing,ep038
747,well I hate to tell you this Arnold but,ep038
750,there are actually no three bedrooms,ep038
753,available in your price range,ep038
756,in downtown Tampa three bedroom condos,ep038
759,and Tampa are a rarity so they really,ep038
762,come at a premium you can spend as much,ep038
765,as a million or a million point two on a,ep038
768,three bedroom downtown st. Pete still,ep038
771,has that urban feel for them and it's,ep038
774,really our sister city it's only about,ep038
777,20 or 30 minutes away today we're gonna,ep038
780,look at the townhouse I think one of the,ep038
783,reasons you might like it is it's good,ep038
786,compromise between a condo and a house,ep038
789,and you still have that city living,ep038
792,I do like it's modern what you obviously,ep038
795,know highlight might be a little might,ep038
798,be a little too modern all right well,ep038
801,this is three bedrooms three and a half,ep038
804,baths and it's listed for 490 although,ep038
807,this is a little over their budget this,ep038
810,house is brand-new and walking distance,ep038
813,to downtown I think it's worth it just,ep038
816,inside the door they look in on a first,ep038
819,floor guest suite before heading up to,ep038
822,the second floor living area Wow look at,ep038
825,this kitchen it's huge yeah you've got,ep038
828,lots of counter space in this kitchen I,ep038
831,yeah I would agree I like it there's a,ep038
834,lot of space here I could definitely see,ep038
837,myself cooking and baking here yeah I,ep038
840,could see you making a mess in here too,ep038
843,with all the flour and baking okay seems,ep038
846,a little small to me but I do like that,ep038
849,it opens up to the window into the,ep038
852,living room and so there's a nice flow,ep038
855,really like these tall windows let's end,ep038
858,a lot of light one of the nice things is,ep038
861,that you have these nice high 10-foot,ep038
864,ceilings it bounces around a lot of,ep038
867,light but the home doesn't have a,ep038
870,fireplace you know this is a lovely,ep038
873,space it's just there's really not a,ep038
876,little whole lot of charm it's not,ep038
879,really my style oh well you know how I,ep038
882,feel I like the modern and I like the,ep038
885,open space so I know it has to be a,ep038
888,balance of opinions though they head up,ep038
891,another flight of stairs to the third,ep038
894,floor they peek in on a bed and bath,ep038
897,before making their way to the master,ep038
900,suite yeah you've got a huge window here,ep038
903,it is pretty bright mm-hmm it's a little,ep038
906,small the master suite just,ep038
909,doesn't seem big enough for us I was,ep038
912,really hoping to be able to keep the,ep038
915,baby in the crib in the room for at,ep038
918,least the first few months I really like,ep038
921,the shower it's nice and big and there's,ep038
924,a clear glass door which I couldn't like,ep038
927,it was pretty big but I like I don't,ep038
930,like yeah but it's got the nice white,ep038
933,countertops that we like countertops are,ep038
936,nice I'll give you that I've got another,ep038
939,surprise for you guys upstairs you want,ep038
942,to see yeah I can't wait oh wow look at,ep038
945,that a dedicated sunbathing deck is that,ep038
948,nice I love it yes that's beautiful I,ep038
951,can see the skyline so although it's not,ep038
954,Tampa it's walking distance from so many,ep038
957,things it's not quite the view we have,ep038
960,downtown but it has an urban feel and,ep038
963,has an urban view and if it means I can,ep038
966,maintain the urban lifestyle I'm willing,ep038
969,to take that view I can for sure see,ep038
972,myself sunbathing in this space I can be,ep038
975,grilling while your Sunday yes you could,ep038
978,I really like the sunbathing deck it,ep038
981,would probably have to be my favorite,ep038
984,part and I like that it's a big open,ep038
987,floor you know what's modern in,ep038
990,contemporary which I really like and I,ep038
993,love the view of the city the problem is,ep038
996,it's the wrong City I would like to be,ep038
999,closer to Tampa the bedrooms are on the,ep038
1002,small side but I really do like how big,ep038
1005,the kitchen is and it's on the upper end,ep038
1008,of our price limit or over either over,ep038
1011,it is but I think for what you're,ep038
1014,getting this is a lot of value in the,ep038
1017,city three bedrooms three and a half,ep038
1020,baths for the rooftop deck your distance,ep038
1023,to downtown that's true I think you,ep038
1026,should keep looking okay so they head,ep038
1029,out to see another place but it still,ep038
1032,may not be what michelle has in mind I,ep038
1035,don't see the the big front porch,ep038
1038,[Music],ep038
1041,well I'm sure I can find something that,ep038
1044,will work for both of you guys and the,ep038
1047,sooner the better because we'd really,ep038
1050,like to be moved in and settled by the,ep038
1053,time the baby comes this Tampa couple is,ep038
1056,expecting their first child and,ep038
1059,upgrading to a bigger place with their,ep038
1062,four hundred and seventy five thousand,ep038
1065,dollar budget they've seen a vintage,ep038
1068,charmer in a quiet Tampa neighborhood,ep038
1071,that had Michelle's big front porch but,ep038
1074,Arnold was concerned about the potential,ep038
1077,maintenance that comes with an old home,ep038
1080,then since Arnold wants to live in an,ep038
1083,urban setting their agent lined up a,ep038
1086,brand new townhouse in the city only,ep038
1089,issue the city was Saint Petersburg,ep038
1092,30 minutes away from Tampa where they'd,ep038
1095,rather be so now they're back in Tampa,ep038
1098,in a quiet neighborhood for Michelle,ep038
1101,such a cute neighborhood yeah this is,ep038
1104,definitely for you hey you guys found it,ep038
1107,Nicole so we've got about two thousand,ep038
1110,square feet and a 1920s bungalow over,ep038
1113,here 1920s might be a lot of maintenance,ep038
1116,it's actually really beautifully redone,ep038
1119,inside all right I can't wait to see it,ep038
1122,I don't see the the big front porch Wow,ep038
1125,where's the front porch I thought that,ep038
1128,front porches were standard with 1920s,ep038
1131,bungalows oh wow it's very bright this,ep038
1134,is an engineered laminate I mean I,ep038
1137,really wanted a hardwood floor Wow look,ep038
1140,at this fireplace I love that it's,ep038
1143,really nice is it work unfortunately it,ep038
1146,doesn't work if I'm going to live in a,ep038
1149,place with charm and that's old I want,ep038
1152,the old part so I want the old hardwood,ep038
1155,floors and I want a working fireplace,ep038
1158,one thing I like is for me but I like a,ep038
1161,modern table that's really nice we can,ep038
1164,write this table into the offer if you,ep038
1167,like it yeah yeah you could have your,ep038
1170,one piece of modern my one piece,ep038
1173,Michelle you wanna take a look at this,ep038
1176,kitchen,ep038
1179,did you like it I love these that,ep038
1182,countertops is this marble they are,ep038
1185,they're really really great for baking,ep038
1188,Wow I love,ep038
1191,I think this is a great kitchen it's,ep038
1194,beautiful they make their way to the,ep038
1197,master suite well I like how big it is,ep038
1200,for sure and is this the master closet,ep038
1203,it is very interesting I'm not sure it,ep038
1206,really functions as a closet yeah I,ep038
1209,would need to hang my clothes on,ep038
1212,something seems like a lot of work this,ep038
1215,is a really cute little bathroom yeah,ep038
1218,that's a little bit of a low ceiling,ep038
1221,though but I like the low seal and I,ep038
1224,think it gives it an extra cozy factor,ep038
1227,it's a decorative element and it is,ep038
1230,breathable and it's all brand new so it,ep038
1233,feels really really clean mm-hmm yeah I,ep038
1236,like how bright it is they look at the,ep038
1239,second bedroom on the first floor as,ep038
1242,well as a bath before heading upstairs,ep038
1245,to look in on two additional bedrooms,ep038
1248,then they make their way to the backyard,ep038
1251,yeah I could actually put in a,ep038
1254,stationary grill built-in and there's a,ep038
1257,lot of sunlight so I can sunbathe so,ep038
1260,we're gonna go through the gate here,ep038
1263,Wow there's also a carriage house over,ep038
1266,here let me show you guys oh very nice,ep038
1269,thank you yeah yeah you've got a little,ep038
1272,sitting area a full-size kitchen and,ep038
1275,then you've got a bedroom and a bath,ep038
1278,right over here very cute,ep038
1281,overall I really like the feel of this,ep038
1284,house I love that it's a bungalow I,ep038
1287,really like the kitchen I love how,ep038
1290,bright it is I love the marble,ep038
1293,countertops I like that it's big and,ep038
1296,open and that it just flows through just,ep038
1299,keep for me but you know I really wanted,ep038
1302,hardwood floors if you're going to go an,ep038
1305,old house I wanted part wood floors and,ep038
1308,I want a working fireplace fine it's,ep038
1311,definitely more of like a Michele style,ep038
1314,home you know it's how little way from,ep038
1317,the city,ep038
1320,it's definitely missing a few of my,ep038
1323,favorite features like the big,ep038
1326,wraparound front porch I was a little,ep038
1329,bit disappointed because I kind of,ep038
1332,envisioned myself sitting on the porch,ep038
1335,in the evenings having some tea and,ep038
1338,hanging out with my kids and my husband,ep038
1341,with none of the homes being exactly,ep038
1344,what each wants these two will have to,ep038
1347,figure out a price a working fireplace,ep038
1350,or of having a sunny spot for sunbathing,ep038
1353,is most important okay so are you guys,ep038
1356,ready to make an offer on one of these,ep038
1359,properties,ep038
1362,[Music],ep038
1365,check out this changing table these,ep038
1368,soon-to-be parents are hunting for a,ep038
1371,home in the Tampa area they've seen,ep038
1374,their options and now it's time to,ep038
1377,decide,ep038
1380,there's the vintage house with the two,ep038
1383,"front porches and that one's 400,000",ep038
1386,well I really like that there are two,ep038
1389,front porches and I really like that,ep038
1392,there are two functioning fireplaces,ep038
1395,kitchen is very nice as a lot of light,ep038
1398,yeah the only thing is the backyard has,ep038
1401,no space for sunbathing and the slanted,ep038
1404,floors are a little concerning I think,ep038
1407,it's definitely got the character that,ep038
1410,you like though right Michelle that one,ep038
1413,has the most charm how about the,ep038
1416,townhouse on st. Pete for 490 well that,ep038
1419,one by far has the best kitchen yeah,ep038
1422,yeah and I love the deck up top not only,ep038
1425,was there girl up there it sunbathe and,ep038
1428,it had a city view it's great you know,ep038
1431,and although the townhome is the most,ep038
1434,modern it's beyond the top of our price,ep038
1437,point but it is brand-new so you'd have,ep038
1440,almost no maintenance that is nice how,ep038
1443,about the bungalow that one's listed for,ep038
1446,360 I really did like the backyard,ep038
1449,especially for sunbathing and I really,ep038
1452,like the style of the home and I had an,ep038
1455,open floor plans really nice mm-hmm it's,ep038
1458,open floor but yet cozy at the same time,ep038
1461,what did you think of that kitchen,ep038
1464,Michelle well I think that it's the,ep038
1467,prettiest kitchen it's not the biggest,ep038
1470,the only thing is the fireplace isn't,ep038
1473,working and there's no front porch it's,ep038
1476,also no closet space so it sounds like,ep038
1479,we've got a lot to talk about we've got,ep038
1482,some decisions to make,ep038
1485,[Music],ep038
1488,well I think that the bungalow makes the,ep038
1491,most sense for us I think that it's the,ep038
1494,best compromise because it has the charm,ep038
1497,and it's modern for you they did just,ep038
1500,remodel it I think that is a good,ep038
1503,compromise is that the one it's the one,ep038
1506,[Applause],ep038
1509,we've been here about six weeks we were,ep038
1512,in a bidding war with two other offers,ep038
1515,and so Nicole advised us to go in at,ep038
1518,full asking price if we wanted to win,ep038
1521,and so we did and then we won check out,ep038
1524,the new house I think this is a really,ep038
1527,good compromise for the two of us,ep038
1530,because I get a lot of charm and it's,ep038
1533,very bright it has a lot of natural,ep038
1536,light that he was looking for I'm so,ep038
1539,glad that you're gonna be staying down,ep038
1542,here when the baby comes I wouldn't miss,ep038
1545,it for the world although having a guest,ep038
1548,house wasn't exactly like our criteria,ep038
1551,having one and has really made a big,ep038
1554,difference and especially having a baby,ep038
1557,on the way,ep038
1560,you know having a mother-in-law being,ep038
1563,able to help out really makes a big,ep038
1566,difference yeah my mom plans to come,ep038
1569,down after the baby's here and have an,ep038
1572,extended stay so she'll be nice and,ep038
1575,comfy out there and I think it's also a,ep038
1578,very baby friendly home in general,ep038
1581,because with juniors out here playing,ep038
1584,and we're in the kitchen cooking we can,ep038
1587,see the baby you might want to stick it,ep038
1590,back in the oven and keep it warm till,ep038
1593,everybody gets here the new kitchen is,ep038
1596,working out really well,ep038
1599,I've enjoyed cooking and baking in it,ep038
1602,one of the other things that we're,ep038
1605,really excited about is this nice,ep038
1608,private backyard now I get a chance to,ep038
1611,sunbathe in private so we decided to,ep038
1614,keep some of the pieces that were left,ep038
1617,behind in this house especially the,ep038
1620,table it's a kind of a nice modern piece,ep038
1623,in an old home and I think it blends,ep038
1626,well moving out here wasn't as bad as I,ep038
1629,thought,ep038
1632,exactly look how many friends we have,ep038
1635,that's true I am actually kind of ready,ep038
1638,for a change especially because we have,ep038
1641,a baby on the way and there's gonna be,ep038
1644,lots of life changes and this is just,ep038
1647,one of them,ep038
1650,curious,ep038

30,Brooke will be your roommate and her,ep039
33,agent are on hand to point out that,ep039
36,vintage homes can be a lot more of a,ep039

90,like goodbye Portland oh so she's,ep039
93,recently relocated to Salem the state,ep039
96,capital 50 miles south of Portland Salem,ep039
99,to me is the perfect town and a great,ep039
102,thing about Salem is that it's a really,ep039
105,affordable place people are really,ep039
108,discovering it I see so much cool stuff,ep039
111,growing here do you need any sort,ep039
114,because that seems like a cool normal,ep039
117,thing for me to have Valley's been,ep039
120,renting a house here in Salem and shares,ep039
123,it with her roommate Brooke I'm the food,ep039
126,and drink reporter for the local paper I,ep039

135,experience where you can just tell that,ep039
138,you're gonna be really good friends and,ep039
141,it's almost like oh here you are,ep039
144,I've moved in right around three months,ep039
147,ago and it just seemed like a perfect,ep039
150,fit we love living together she cooks a,ep039
153,huge shushing this is what you kind of,ep039
156,make things fancy and we both love,ep039

171,renting and buy this is my first house,ep039
174,and I'm buying it on my own and she's,ep039
177,asked Brooke to move in with her as a,ep039
180,roommate in the new house I love,ep039
183,bouncing ideas off Brooke I love getting,ep039
186,her opinions on things we're a really,ep039
189,good team for it if this house doesn't,ep039
192,already have a like secret room behind a,ep039
195,bookcase then I'm just gonna yeah no,ep039
198,absolutely okay I was pretty flexible,ep039
201,with my budget I got approved for four,ep039
204,hundred thousand but I really want to,ep039
207,spend way less than that,ep039
210,you know sweet English cottage it's so,ep039

222,I really love a contemporary style a,ep039
225,newly constructed modern meets craftsman,ep039
228,would be ideal for Brooke most things,ep039
231,and we're ganar pretty new but I just,ep039
234,think old houses are interesting I think,ep039
237,they have like a story to them and even,ep039
240,from New Orleans,ep039
243,I want charm you've got a neat little,ep039
246,touches maybe the wood framed windows I,ep039
249,really do want to be within about a mile,ep039
252,of the Capitol building because you can,ep039
255,farmers market walk downtown and easily,ep039
258,bike there it's really important that I,ep039
261,have a guest bedroom to welcome my,ep039
264,friends when they come visit one point,ep039
267,two five laughs what it's uneven Dean,ep039
270,we're two girls living together we need,ep039
273,two bathrooms I have been known to take,ep039
276,up to three baths per day I would adore,ep039
279,to have a great ensuite bathtub girl,ep039
282,stay calm,ep039
285,I need a big big yard my dog is giant so,ep039
288,I really want space for her to roam,ep039
291,around and I love entertaining outside,ep039
294,and I also love to garden so I would,ep039
297,really like some space for a garden in,ep039
300,the back I would love a big walk-in,ep039
303,closet I have a lot of dresses and I,ep039
306,would just love a little bit more room,ep039
309,for a bedroom and closet space Kelly has,ep039
312,way more dresses than I do what I do,ep039
315,have a lot of stuff I know everyone in,ep039
318,the world loves an open-concept kitchen,ep039
321,but not me I do not want my kitchen,ep039
324,possibly on this way I tend to cook a,ep039
327,little bit more than Kelly does I would,ep039
330,love to see a little bit more space I,ep039
333,would floor mat that kind of thing,ep039
336,selfishly the better the kitchen Brooke,ep039
339,has then the more I get to eat her food,ep039
342,which is amazing,ep039

510,positive please tell me not all the,ep039
513,bedrooms are this not okay well you need,ep039
516,to keep an open mind they head upstairs,ep039
519,to see the remaining bedrooms this is,ep039
522,the smaller of the bedrooms I love this,ep039
525,nice and bright oh this is really sweet,ep039
528,I love the eaves that's one of my,ep039
531,favorite things about house at this age,ep039
534,let's do what we got in here this is the,ep039
537,bigger one I don't mind the bedroom but,ep039

543,gonna be a little small onward we go all,ep039
546,right so this is not hot bath right here,ep039
549,that's it okay maybe this is what we,ep039
552,were thinking about when we said a,ep039
555,quarter of a bathroom I've been so,ep039
558,excited to think about having it up in,ep039
561,my room when you have a 1937 or any,ep039
564,older home they just typically don't,ep039
567,have master ensuite oh this is wonderful,ep039
570,it's like you're having a tree house I,ep039
573,mean this is great I don't have time but,ep039
576,maybe I have a big closet open mind in,ep039
579,the future you could definitely add on,ep039
582,your master ensuite and take your,ep039
585,breaths every night they head back to,ep039
588,the kitchen to see one more unique,ep039
591,feature oh wow your girl's gonna fall,ep039

612,it's really spacious,ep039
615,is this a house you would consider it's,ep039
618,a little bit further from downtown the,ep039
621,capital than I'd hoped but it's the,ep039
624,English cottage which I absolutely love,ep039
627,the price is just right the best part of,ep039
630,the house for me is that backyard it's,ep039
633,exactly what we want there's some really,ep039
636,great things but some tough things,ep039
639,I mean rooms are really small that,ep039
642,kitchen lovely but tiny and one of the,ep039
645,dreams of having my own home is that,ep039
648,ensuite and the big closet where are you,ep039
651,going to put all your stuff there are,ep039
654,some negatives and they're not easy,ep039
657,fixes idilu' yet if she wants more space,ep039
660,and updated touches Callie may have to,ep039
663,think newer not my favorite style,ep039
666,[Music],ep039
669,first-time buyer Kelly is looking for a,ep039
672,home with a roommate Brooke in Salem,ep039
675,"Oregon but with a budget of $400,000",ep039
678,she's having a hard time finding a place,ep039
681,that meets all of her needs you don't,ep039
684,think of me as a good home renovators,ep039
687,Kelly dreams of an older house and an,ep039
690,ensuite bathroom so far they've seen an,ep039
693,English cottage that was big on charm,ep039
696,but short on closet and bathroom space,ep039
699,so today they're looking at brand new,ep039
702,construction with more living space not,ep039
705,my favorite style but it's definitely,ep039
708,mine Kelly no Rhonda I don't know I know,ep039
711,she wants old and charming however,ep039
714,there's a lot of things about new,ep039
717,construction that would be good for a,ep039
720,first-time homebuyer,ep039
723,it is a little further from the Capitol,ep039
726,than you would normally like but it is a,ep039
729,beautiful new construction there's,ep039
732,advantages to that,ep039
735,"this home has 2,000 square feet 4",ep039
738,bedrooms 2 baths and 420 thousand,ep039
741,I don't even know if I should look at it,ep039
744,Rhonda that's way above the budget I,ep039
747,know but it's my job to negotiate for,ep039
750,you and I want you have an open mind,ep039
753,it's a beautiful home there we are it's,ep039
756,very contemporary which is not always my,ep039
759,style but I will say that it's very,ep039
762,beautifully done,ep039
765,and oh okay whoa that's that island is,ep039
768,amazing I will give you that this is a,ep039
771,beautiful kitchen this is my dream,ep039
774,island I can pretend that I'm a,ep039
777,restaurant TV shows I mean I love that,ep039
780,we have all of this cabinet space I love,ep039
783,the backsplash but this is an,ep039
786,open-concept kitchen but I do love that,ep039
789,there's been touch details all the,ep039
792,molding around the windows we've got a,ep039
795,chandelier we've got the fireplace there,ep039
798,it's growing on me so you're not gonna,ep039
801,have to worry about the wiring the,ep039
804,plumbing the sewer line with a brand new,ep039
807,home you get the best of both worlds it,ep039
810,could be nice especially since it's my,ep039
813,first home to know that I'm not gonna,ep039
816,have those problems oh this is a really,ep039
819,nice bathroom,ep039
822,oh really pretty I think this is really,ep039
825,nice I love that there's a lot of space,ep039
828,a lot of cabinets and I see a deep,ep039
831,bathtub over there that's pretty good,ep039
834,since this is a four bedroom Brooke can,ep039
837,have her pick of three spare bedrooms,ep039
840,all right this is a pretty great closet,ep039
843,yeah I'm a big fan this house is a,ep039
846,little bit more my style,ep039
849,it's spacious it has clean lines just I,ep039
852,think a more livable space they head to,ep039
855,the master bedroom,ep039
858,Wow there's lovely high ceilings,ep039
861,it's so big in here and it's a beautiful,ep039
864,room,ep039
867,the big moment the big reveal well let,ep039
870,me see my bathtub hold your breath,ep039
873,no surprise it's a shower and no bathtub,ep039
876,alright let's check out the rest of this,ep039
879,cuz I think I see a nice closet back,ep039
882,here I mean this is really nice but our,ep039
885,my tears from not having a bathtub going,ep039
888,to stain this carpet but at least Kelly,ep039
891,you do have an ensuite yes I do and it's,ep039
894,nice but it's also sort of like well,ep039
897,otherwise how was the plain mrs. Lincoln,ep039
900,let's go see the backyard and I'm sorry,ep039
903,for comparing a national tragedy to me,ep039
906,not having a bathtub but that's what it,ep039
909,is now Kelly I want you to have an open,ep039
912,mind here I don't know not very big for,ep039
915,the dogs it stinks because I kind of,ep039
918,really like the inside of the house when,ep039
921,I walked up I thought no way but it,ep039
924,really grew on me I really like as a,ep039
927,first-time homeowner I know that,ep039
930,everything works,ep039
933,it's energy-efficient that's exactly the,ep039
936,kitchen that I was dreaming about major,ep039
939,major plus it's a beautiful master,ep039
942,bedroom and we now could have closet,ep039
945,space on the downside it really doesn't,ep039
948,have that feel of an old house that I,ep039
951,love and this is a beautiful,ep039
954,neighborhood it's not walkable the,ep039
957,bathtub it is such a priority for me,ep039
960,and it's already over my budget and if I,ep039
963,knew that I could just put in a tub that,ep039
966,would be my dream master suite but it,ep039
969,already would be a stretch to buy this,ep039
972,house,ep039
975,since style and location were issues,ep039
978,Rhonda is taking them to a renovated,ep039
981,house near the Capitol but style and,ep039
984,convenience still come with a price tag,ep039
987,Wow the top of my budget,ep039
990,[Music],ep039
993,Kellie is searching Salem Oregon for her,ep039
996,first town but even with the help of a,ep039
999,roommate Brooke and her agent Rhonda,ep039
1002,she's struggling to find a house that,ep039
1005,"fits all her needs and her $400,000 max",ep039
1008,budget so far they've seen a well-priced,ep039
1011,English cottage big on charm but short,ep039
1014,on space then they saw a new,ep039
1017,contemporary home with a bigger living,ep039
1020,space and a bigger price tag but neither,ep039
1023,house was in the location she wanted,ep039
1026,near the Capitol so now Rhonda is,ep039
1029,showing them a renovated home in Kellis,ep039
1032,ideal location well I love this,ep039
1035,neighborhood,ep039
1038,this is really close to the Capitol kind,ep039
1041,of looks like a farmhouse but it's cute,ep039
1044,three-bedroom two-bath uh-huh 1998,ep039
1047,"square feet and it's 375,000 Wow okay",ep039
1050,right at the top of my budget I think,ep039
1053,you're gonna love it,ep039
1056,all right let's go check it out okay,ep039
1059,here it is this is gorgeous as,ep039
1062,in so New Orleans in here you've got the,ep039
1065,high ceilings you've got the crown,ep039
1068,molding in the wainscoting and is,ep039
1071,gorgeous gorgeous fixture all right,ep039
1074,let's see the kitchen the kitchen is,ep039
1077,very New Orleanian which I love and then,ep039
1080,you have a little breakfast nook right,ep039
1083,over here as well but I hate,ep039
1086,open-concept kitchen and I love I know,ep039
1089,it's at least also I don't like nachos,ep039
1092,either I'm a weirdo I don't know what to,ep039
1095,tell you huh what would you use it for,ep039
1098,don't watch sports I don't have Super,ep039
1101,Bowl parties maybe an office,ep039
1104,giant space and I just want a little,ep039
1107,office this is beautiful I love like the,ep039
1110,trellis this patio but not really big,ep039
1113,enough for the dogs to run around and,ep039
1116,small for us and I would love to have,ep039
1119,garden beds outside they head back,ep039
1122,inside to check out the first floor,ep039
1125,bedrooms you know this could be our,ep039
1128,guest bedroom bedroom next bedroom so,ep039
1131,this would be Mayra probably do you like,ep039
1134,it yeah I do I mean it's pretty they,ep039
1137,make their way to the downstairs back,ep039
1140,there is your claw foot tub I love that,ep039
1143,it kind of has that vintage feel but,ep039
1146,it's been totally redone this is a dream,ep039
1149,bathroom me and that's how our gonna,ep039
1152,talk about our life goals and then we're,ep039
1155,gonna marry each other they head,ep039
1158,upstairs hoping the second floor master,ep039
1161,suite is just as charming oh and it's,ep039
1164,got the ensuite um why would you make a,ep039
1167,shower without a bathtub Oh Callie it's,ep039
1170,a gorgeous shower you know that I think,ep039
1173,showers are the devil's cleaning method,ep039
1176,let's check out the closet oh my gosh,ep039
1179,it's a walk-in that's pretty pretty,ep039
1182,pretty great this is an exquisite house,ep039
1185,it reminds me of the houses that I loved,ep039
1188,so much when I was little it's close to,ep039
1191,the Capitol I love the high ceilings the,ep039
1194,fixtures the wainscoting and that master,ep039
1197,aside from the shower is glorious but,ep039
1200,there are some things that give me a,ep039
1203,little bit of pause that TV room doesn't,ep039
1206,really make much sense for you all,ep039
1209,so with three dogs we're gonna have a,ep039
1212,lot of issues with the backyard yes well,ep039
1215,you girls have a lot to be thinking,ep039
1218,about this evening we're gonna sink away,ep039
1221,since none of the homes have the ensuite,ep039
1224,soaking tub,ep039
1227,Kelly will have to decide between yard,ep039
1230,space closet space or the vintage charm,ep039
1233,she loves I can't buy all three yeah,ep039
1236,[Music],ep039
1239,[Applause],ep039
1242,"Kelly has up to $400,000 to spend on her",ep039
1245,first home with roommate Brooke they've,ep039
1248,seen a number of places now it's time to,ep039
1251,decide so we have seen three amazing,ep039
1254,houses let's start with the cottage the,ep039
1257,English cottage so that one wants to,ep039
1260,turn a 50 thousand on the upside I love,ep039
1263,how it looks definitely the best of all,ep039
1266,the backyards that we got the price is,ep039
1269,right,ep039
1272,but there's no ensuite the bedrooms,ep039
1275,there are pretty small I just feel like,ep039
1278,we're gonna worry about the closet space,ep039
1281,and that kitchen is so pretty but so,ep039
1284,small we wanted a hidden door but I,ep039
1287,don't want to accidentally fall down,ep039
1290,into a basement older houses have things,ep039
1293,go wrong let's talk about the modern,ep039
1296,craftsman for 20 it was far away from,ep039
1299,Capitol downtown I know it's not your,ep039
1302,style both the kitchen it like came back,ep039
1305,to me and knowing that everything is,ep039
1308,good to go because it's all new that's a,ep039
1311,great feeling,ep039
1314,bigger rooms a ton of closet space but,ep039
1317,that price tag if I'm gonna spend this,ep039
1320,much money I want to tub well let's talk,ep039
1323,about the house 375 is such an amazing,ep039
1326,location I fell in love it reminded me,ep039
1329,so much of the beautiful houses in New,ep039
1332,Orleans that I really missed with,ep039
1335,bathroom downstairs absolutely gorgeous,ep039
1338,I love that you had that whole upstairs,ep039
1341,to yourself,ep039
1344,but an entertainment room well,ep039
1347,yeah what the heck am I gonna do with it,ep039
1350,there was a beautiful bathroom right off,ep039
1353,the master but you just wish it was a,ep039
1356,tub yeah I know just a little bit more,ep039
1359,space in that backyard would make a huge,ep039
1362,difference,ep039
1365,[Music],ep039
1368,they're great houses but you know what,ep039
1371,you're gonna say right yeah it's the,ep039
1374,English cottage for 250 of course it is,ep039
1377,you knew that right of course yeah,ep039
1380,absolutely,ep039
1383,that yard is like a beautiful little,ep039
1386,Park it's totally a Kelly house and,ep039
1389,because it's so low priced it can be,ep039
1392,even more of a Kelly house in a few,ep039
1395,years,ep039
1398,let's call Rhonda I my heart is so clear,ep039
1401,on this I put in an offer for a full,ep039
1404,price 250 and it does need a new super,ep039
1407,one it's gonna be a pain and it's gonna,ep039
1410,cost some money but I would have been,ep039
1413,crazy not to do this one we actually,ep039
1416,just started moving into the house about,ep039
1419,a week ago it's coming together I ended,ep039
1422,up taking the bigger bedroom with a,ep039
1425,teeny teeny closet so I am working on,ep039
1428,storage solutions yay thank you so much,ep039
1431,no mom I'll see you outside,ep039
1434,perfect I had always hoped that I might,ep039
1437,get that master suite with a tub,ep039
1440,and I didn't get that but there is a,ep039
1443,place very near here where they make,ep039
1446,beautiful cedar Japanese soaking tubs,ep039
1449,and when I'll get that hot tub that will,ep039
1452,be even better,ep039
1455,it's an extravagance but,ep039
1458,I get my toe it's just outside it is the,ep039
1461,perfect backyards it's amazing to go,ep039
1464,outside have dinner and watch the dogs,ep039
1467,totally frolicking outside after I got,ep039
1470,unmarried I thought that maybe I would,ep039
1473,never be able to own a house and afford,ep039
1476,one on my own and it makes me feel so,ep039
1479,proud I can't even wait for all the,ep039
1482,wonderful dinner parties and Christmases,ep039
1485,and I feel like the luckiest lady in the,ep039
1488,whole world I'm gonna cry if we keep,ep039
1491,talking,ep039
1494,[Music],ep039
12,open concept Natalie wants a,ep040
15,contemporary style home in Salt Lake,ep040
18,City with wide open spaces and a large,ep040
21,closet husband Steve's wish list,ep040
24,couldn't be more different,ep040
27,this is an all brick bungalow built in,ep040
30,1951 I really like that he's Pro vintage,ep040
33,character like this original hardwood,ep040
36,and above all he wants a game room for,ep040
39,himself look at that angled wall that is,ep040
42,perfect for two arcade games whose,ep040
45,preferences will went out and I love the,ep040
48,flooring I'd loved it,ep040
51,this laminate flooring that looks like,ep040
54,hardwoods to me you can just hang out on,ep040
57,the stairs,ep040
60,[Music],ep040
63,Oh DISA good job my name is Steve and I,ep040
66,work for a trucking company I'm Natalie,ep040
69,and I worked for a hospitality,ep040
72,technology we've been together seven,ep040
75,years and married six look at these,ep040
78,trees oh they're so are you and we have,ep040
81,a silver lab named Lucian and two cats,ep040
84,juice and Mulan Steve is a man-child he,ep040
87,is very much he's just he's really,ep040
90,playful he's also really loyal he's the,ep040
93,friend that everybody wants to hang out,ep040
96,with he's just super chill and Natalie,ep040
99,she loves to be the center of attention,ep040
102,and I love her because she's so sweet,ep040
105,and easygoing if it's her way oh that's,ep040
108,really loving their house hunting now,ep040
111,since they want to move from Provo to,ep040
114,the Salt Lake City area to eliminate the,ep040
117,40 mile commute,ep040
120,I travel to the airports a lot for work,ep040
123,and I land 11:30 at night and where we,ep040
126,are now I'm not home till one o'clock in,ep040
129,the morning and the where I work in Salt,ep040
132,Lake it's an hour each way so it's just,ep040
135,a grind to get there so I just want to,ep040
138,be closer to work I think Salt Lake is,ep040
141,really interesting because there's so,ep040
144,much to do there's the urban life,ep040
147,there's museums we do a lot of hiking,ep040
150,especially with the dog and we love to,ep040
153,four-wheel so there's a lot to do,ep040
156,outside of just the city itself,ep040
159,yeah that's pretty neat you like that,ep040
162,yeah up top and below yeah I don't know,ep040
165,"you at all our max budget is $350,000",ep040
168,we're looking to get something under,ep040
171,that in case there's any upgrades that,ep040
174,need to happen so 325 350 is our target,ep040
177,currently we're staying with my parents,ep040
180,as we're in between buying and selling,ep040
183,polish she wants a place a lot like,ep040
186,their Provo house which they put on the,ep040
189,market our current home is new and he,ep040
192,really wants old yeah so we'll see you,ep040
195,want something with a little bit more,ep040
198,character than what we have right he's,ep040
201,looking for a brick Craftsman style,ep040
204,bungalow the hardwood floors and wood,ep040
207,railing on the banisters that's what I,ep040
210,really love the best and so something,ep040
213,built in the 30s through the 50s is my,ep040
216,idea,ep040
219,architectural II I just love the way,ep040
222,contemporary homes look they're not very,ep040
225,fussy they just look very clean and I'm,ep040
228,a huge football fan so Sunday to me is,ep040
231,very important and everybody migrates to,ep040
234,the kitchen so the open concept between,ep040
237,the living room and the kitchen is,ep040
240,really important also I love an island,ep040
243,and first and foremost gas stove it is,ep040
246,the most important thing I don't know,ep040
249,why any home builder and this is my plea,ep040
252,to any home builder please stop putting,ep040
255,in electric stoves they're just they're,ep040
258,cruel it's supposed to be a kitchen I,ep040
261,don't know no we're really looking for a,ep040
264,three-bedroom two-bath he's saying three,ep040
267,I believe the ideal number would be four,ep040
270,because he wants a memorabilia room yeah,ep040
273,I have collectibles and I like pinball,ep040
276,my comic book heads yeah toys are comp,ep040
279,ties I just want to have a room so I can,ep040
282,display all of my sports and be behind a,ep040
285,door is the goal so four bedroom two,ep040
288,bath would be our kind of minimum yes,ep040
291,they both like a wood-burning fireplace,ep040
294,fenced-in yard for their dog and a,ep040
297,two-car garage she also wants space for,ep040
300,a home office and a walk-in closet in,ep040
303,the master I have specific hangers for,ep040
306,long-sleeve I have different colored,ep040
309,hangers for short sleeve Steve has some,ep040
312,space in the closet not much I love this,ep040
315,area thank you I'm really excited about,ep040
318,being in a larger community where we,ep040
321,have things that are a little bit more,ep040
324,culture driven we just don't really have,ep040
327,a lot of that where we are right now,ep040
330,cheers to good luck and finding our new,ep040
333,place this is cute it's not contemporary,ep040
336,that's for sure it is a cottage bungalow,ep040
339,style you know the stone is really nice,ep040
342,what's the price on this this one is,ep040
345,three thirteen which is whoa wait within,ep040
348,"your budget just under 2,000 square feet",ep040
351,okay it was built in 1986 I don't really,ep040
354,like siding you know cuz I want a brick,ep040
357,house it's nice but it's not at all what,ep040
360,I would pick but you're gonna love it,ep040
363,all right I like this house for Steven,ep040
366,natalie.b,ep040
369,cuz it does have a little bit of,ep040
372,character and style that Steve was super,ep040
375,interested in and it's updated inside,ep040
378,which is one of Natalie's big wish lists,ep040
381,as well okay yeah it's not bad,ep040
384,there's stairs I didn't expect a,ep040
387,split-level sure it's a little small but,ep040
390,it's nice I think the style of this,ep040
393,house is close to what I like but I,ep040
396,don't like that it's a newer home oh I,ep040
399,just saw something I really like oh yeah,ep040
402,here's to be a wood burning yeah and it,ep040
405,has a mantle which is a big deal yes for,ep040
408,Sunday's and football I could mount the,ep040
411,TV over the mantel shouldn't mortify my,ep040
414,mother but that's a big plus I love the,ep040
417,flooring I love that it's laminate its,ep040
420,flooring that looks like hardwoods to,ep040
423,meet you can just hang out on the stairs,ep040
426,I do like the wood though should we go,ep040
429,check out the kitchen yeah let's check,ep040
432,it out it seems like it is open I mean,ep040
435,it's a doorway but I wonder if this is,ep040
438,something that could come down do you,ep040
441,think so I am not sure if it's a bearing,ep040
444,wall or not to be honest oh I see some,ep040
447,this is so cool I love this this is a,ep040
450,big deal for me well and what is this,ep040
453,area right here this is your dining room,ep040
456,this is the only dining area yeah Oh,ep040
459,given the size of the home I wasn't,ep040
462,anticipating there not to be a proper,ep040
465,dining room they check out the backyard,ep040
468,man beautiful then go back inside to see,ep040
471,the bedrooms on the second level has,ep040
474,some more carpets but we're back to,ep040
477,hardwood up here and this carpet is,ep040
480,disgusting,ep040
483,but look at that angled wall that is,ep040
486,perfect for two arcade games Oh Steve,ep040
489,oh yeah Natalie this would be a good,ep040
492,office for you I think you might be,ep040
495,right Steve I don't say that very often,ep040
498,really good they see a full bath this is,ep040
501,the fifth flooring we've seen so far,ep040
504,then the master oh this is a good size,ep040
507,yeah this is and here's the the mouth,ep040
510,that's a little little cozy little blue,ep040
513,what do you think yeah that's very blue,ep040
516,once again another floor like that well,ep040
519,let's take a look at the closet behind,ep040
522,the door yeah um this is the size for,ep040
525,maybe a toddler organization is a huge,ep040
528,deal for me and it's just a sad sad,ep040
531,little walk-in closet it'll take me a,ep040
534,minute so no exit here,ep040
537,wait for me they head downstairs to see,ep040
540,the basement oh this looks like a good,ep040
543,football room I like it and I love that,ep040
546,it's a walkout basement but what is it,ep040
549,like eight or nine they see the joining,ep040
552,bedroom and another full bath yet again,ep040
555,another floor I think it had a lot of,ep040
558,pluses like the wood fireplaces big huge,ep040
561,thing that gas stove was a must which,ep040
564,you delivered on that the walk-in closet,ep040
567,was very but the backyard is great,ep040
570,I'm still confused about the house of,ep040
573,flooring well because you're on the,ep040
576,lower side of your budget you know there,ep040
579,are a couple projects that you probably,ep040
582,could eventually work in too but I just,ep040
585,wasn't keen on the siding and it wasn't,ep040
588,the contemporary that I was looking for,ep040
591,either so their agent lines up a brick,ep040
594,home for Steve with something for,ep040
597,Natalie to it's absolutely not,ep040
600,contemporary maybe on the outside but I,ep040
603,think you'll be excited to see the,ep040
606,inside okay great,ep040
609,[Music],ep040
612,I want to check out these in tables so,ep040
615,take them for a second after putting,ep040
618,their house on the market in Provo Utah,ep040
621,Steve and Natalie are searching for new,ep040
624,digs in Salt Lake City this is better,ep040
627,better for what for the collectible I'm,ep040
630,now working with a three hundred and,ep040
633,fifty thousand dollar budget they've,ep040
636,seen a well-priced split-level with a,ep040
639,bit of the craftsman look Steve like,ep040
642,Natalie was a fan of the kitchen but the,ep040
645,home was missing her open-concept and,ep040
648,his vintage charm so their agent is,ep040
651,trying again with an older home this is,ep040
654,a ranch Rambler style home okay was,ep040
657,built in 1965 it is three hundred and,ep040
660,fifty thousand dollars on budget a,ep040
663,"little over 2,600 square feet",ep040
666,Wow so it's large it's not really my,ep040
669,style but it is brick and it's,ep040
672,absolutely not contemporary maybe on the,ep040
675,outside but I think you'll be excited to,ep040
678,see the inside okay great another great,ep040
681,feature is a mother-in-law apartment oh,ep040
684,that's not good in this house this is,ep040
687,your open concept,ep040
690,yes shut it and look at the mantles on,ep040
693,top yeah,ep040
696,cut out the floor is the perfect I'm get,ep040
699,to laminate wood flooring it right now,ep040
702,I'm turned off by this house because,ep040
705,it's too new in my mind for my style,ep040
708,because it just looks like every other,ep040
711,model home made in the last five years,ep040
714,this hits every single mark that I was,ep040
717,looking for this open concept is perfect,ep040
720,like a TV space might be a little,ep040
723,difficult because I'm not seeing a wall,ep040
726,where you could actually create cuz you,ep040
729,wouldn't rather mess up the brick and I,ep040
732,have no problem floating furniture but,ep040
735,yeah it's hard to find a good TV wow,ep040
738,yeah oh I can I say that what I noticed,ep040
741,in the oh oh you know see there you go,ep040
744,yeah oh and look at the island it's,ep040
747,different color than the rest of,ep040
750,cabinets yeah that is weird,ep040
753,but but but but it's an island and it's,ep040
756,a Big Island and,ep040
759,love this house lexical is it to bring,ep040
762,in a gas line is that something that yes,ep040
765,so we just have to see if somewhere you,ep040
768,would be able to bring in gas from from,ep040
771,the garage over there and here's your,ep040
774,dining area loving the space if you,ep040
777,notice there is a red stores yeah that,ep040
780,is nice I mean the space is really nice,ep040
783,I mean the flow of the room is really,ep040
786,nice large windows in the front yeah but,ep040
789,love it this flooring is all the way,ep040
792,through they see two bedrooms one could,ep040
795,be her office the other could house his,ep040
798,collectibles then it's on to the master,ep040
801,oh wow yeah this is a good-size French,ep040
804,doors this is awesome,ep040
807,is that your closet it has a door oh,ep040
810,it's a hole,ep040
813,it's teeny teeny teeny tiny you know my,ep040
816,guess is is that because it is a 1960s,ep040
819,home that this was an afterthought and,ep040
822,it looks like it was probably put,ep040
825,together later on yeah it is by,ep040
828,definition walking it is they check out,ep040
831,the master bath oh yeah this is girl,ep040
834,this is really nice girl I really like,ep040
837,this before heading to the backyard it's,ep040
840,just a little bland like it just doesn't,ep040
843,have much character the fence is kind of,ep040
846,low but it is fully fenced no it is not,ep040
849,fully fenced over there is an RV pad,ep040
852,okay so you need to add a defense there,ep040
855,they move on to the mother-in-law,ep040
858,basement okay this is a mini-fridge kind,ep040
861,of like this house times two it looks,ep040
864,similar upstairs those downstairs so,ep040
867,this is another wood-burning fireplace,ep040
870,down here love this using the downstairs,ep040
873,for entertaining seems like an ideal,ep040
876,solution because then you wouldn't have,ep040
879,to worry about where to put the TV,ep040
882,upstairs see Jimmy this seems like,ep040
885,wasted space I don't know why a house,ep040
888,needs two kitchens well look there's the,ep040
891,third bathroom then yes,ep040
894,okay so then there's more yep they see,ep040
897,two more bedrooms the thing we have to,ep040
900,think about though is would we really,ep040
903,use this space it's a huge house it's,ep040
906,almost like like I said it's a house,ep040
909,times two,ep040
912,everything is consistent everything is,ep040
915,brand-new you hit it absolutely on the,ep040
918,head with this but never wrong the,ep040
921,problem is it's too matchy-matchy and to,ep040
924,me it's too sterile I mean all the rooms,ep040
927,look the same there's no uniqueness to,ep040
930,them about the contemporary is that it,ep040
933,is all bad shape so but we are at the,ep040
936,very top of our budget sure but the nice,ep040
939,part is there's not a single reason it,ep040
942,is a turnkey home other than to the,ep040
945,fence yard yeah yeah the dog right away,ep040
948,your dog so their agent takes another,ep040
951,shot at finding something they'll both,ep040
954,like it it's brick yeah I really like,ep040
957,that very charming,ep040
960,I don't see a garage,ep040
963,[Music],ep040
966,hey baby are you ready Natalie and Steve,ep040
969,are hunting in Salt Lake City Utah to,ep040
972,cut down on their commutes working with,ep040
975,"a $350,000 budget they've seen a 1980s",ep040
978,split-level with some of the craftsman,ep040
981,touches Steve likes and a 1960s brick,ep040
984,with Natalie's open concept but it also,ep040
987,had small closets and lots of extra,ep040
990,space they're not sure what to do with,ep040
993,so now they're heading to a smaller,ep040
996,vintage I like it it's brick yeah I,ep040
999,really like that this is an all brick,ep040
1002,bungalow built in 1951 very charming I,ep040
1005,really love the exterior of the house,ep040
1008,with how old it looks and I know natalie,ep040
1011,has a problem with it because it's not,ep040
1014,new like she always wants I don't see a,ep040
1017,garage you know what the garage is,ep040
1020,around back it's a detached two-car and,ep040
1023,it's fully fenced and the best part,ep040
1026,about this this is under budget for you,ep040
1029,guys it is 326 okay yeah I can promise,ep040
1032,to keep an open mind let's check it out,ep040
1035,okay,ep040
1038,all right oh yeah this is nice I like,ep040
1041,that that's really cool that's,ep040
1044,interesting well what do you deal with,ep040
1047,that it looks like you could use this as,ep040
1050,a sitting area you could use it for TV,ep040
1053,you can stick a TV in there sitting area,ep040
1056,for the cats maybe yeah if I sit on that,ep040
1059,I'm not getting back up the hardwoods,ep040
1062,are really nice though it looks like,ep040
1065,real hurt yeah it's original hardwood,ep040
1068,I'm a little confused by this room it,ep040
1071,doesn't connect anything it's not the,ep040
1074,open concept that I like actually I,ep040
1077,think this is probably the only space in,ep040
1080,this upstairs area that's for,ep040
1083,entertaining so you'd have to decide,ep040
1086,what you would use this room for home,ep040
1089,maybe we can knock the wall down,ep040
1092,oh now if I can blow that wall out it's,ep040
1095,good to go and look at the dining space,ep040
1098,the dining space is great it's a good,ep040
1101,sized eating area for two people even,ep040
1104,though it may be a small space with the,ep040
1107,windows maybe it doesn't feel as small,ep040
1110,then what do you think yeah I like it,ep040
1113,cuz it's got like four windows in here,ep040
1116,that's nice yeah the kitchen itself is,ep040
1119,perfect it just definitely doesn't have,ep040
1122,that open concept and agreed they see,ep040
1125,the backyard,ep040
1128,like this yeah this is a good-sized,ep040
1131,space I like the fire pit how it's built,ep040
1134,in that is pretty neat and two bedrooms,ep040
1137,okay this is a stair this could either,ep040
1140,be the you know master or this could be,ep040
1143,just the guest room the closet that's,ep040
1146,not a walk-in then they see a full bath,ep040
1149,before heading to the basement,ep040
1152,I like that fireplace all brick then I,ep040
1155,do like the mantel yeah can't really I,ep040
1158,guess you could do a couch against the,ep040
1161,wall here I mean yeah it is really you,ep040
1164,can put one back here though so this,ep040
1167,could be used as a master over actually,ep040
1170,I guess I could use this as my,ep040
1173,collectible room let's look at the,ep040
1176,bathroom,ep040
1179,whoa what is happening in here this is,ep040
1182,the closet this is a walk-in closet Gale,ep040
1185,scratch my collectible room this is a,ep040
1188,proper walk-in closet I love this I love,ep040
1191,this I love this so then we have to have,ep040
1194,the conversation about guest room versus,ep040
1197,collectible room because we're down to,ep040
1200,three bedrooms yeah but I think we,ep040
1203,couldn't have a collectible room in this,ep040
1206,house at all it would have to be the,ep040
1209,garage too small you know we'd have the,ep040
1212,guest room and then the master would be,ep040
1215,down here and we could both be in that,ep040
1218,closet that's what I really like it,ep040
1221,always I don't think so,ep040
1224,I love the brick the hardwood floors are,ep040
1227,really awesome I love that they're,ep040
1230,original and that's really important to,ep040
1233,me and I love the age of the home but,ep040
1236,the rooms are a little bit small and,ep040
1239,there's no collectible room for me I,ep040
1242,mean I think the home is a really nice,ep040
1245,feel to it the open concept is a huge,ep040
1248,mess for me so that downstairs with the,ep040
1251,walk-in closet is everything and love it,ep040
1254,if they can't both get everything they,ep040
1257,want they'll have to compromise and it,ep040
1260,may come down to an open concept versus,ep040
1263,character okay so maybe we just say,ep040
1266,which one we're thinking Steve and,ep040
1269,Natalie have a max budget of three,ep040
1272,hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a,ep040
1275,new home in Salt Lake City Utah their,ep040
1278,agents showed them several options and,ep040
1281,now it's time to decide first was a 1980,ep040
1284,split-level with a cottage bungalow look,ep040
1287,that was 3:13 I did like that that house,ep040
1290,had an office for you and a collectible,ep040
1293,room for me the backyard was great yeah,ep040
1296,and it did have the wood-burning,ep040
1299,fireplace yeah and the gas stove and it,ep040
1302,had the fake hardwood floors the house,ep040
1305,of floors and then we have the one I,ep040
1308,love the Rambler ranch-style that was,ep040
1311,three hundred fifty thousand it did have,ep040
1314,that open concept that I absolutely,ep040
1317,loved but it was just so sterile the,ep040
1320,house is built in 1965 but on the inside,ep040
1323,it just looked like every other model,ep040
1326,home on the planet they did have an,ep040
1329,electric stove and football Sunday you,ep040
1332,know how important that is,ep040
1335,yeah it seems like that house wasn't,ep040
1338,made for a TV upstairs but tons of room,ep040
1341,for one in the basement yeah but it,ep040
1344,wasn't the highest price point that we,ep040
1347,have so let's talk about the brick home,ep040
1350,"326,000 it has a little bit of the carp",ep040
1353,mentalize flow yeah it means that first,ep040
1356,room it was just that room right but I,ep040
1359,think we have potential there I mean if,ep040
1362,we were able to maybe look at opening up,ep040
1365,that space and it had the gas stove had,ep040
1368,a wood-burning fireplace I had a walk-in,ep040
1371,closet,ep040
1374,and it did like that brick style of home,ep040
1377,better than the rest okay so maybe we,ep040
1380,just say which one we're thinking I like,ep040
1383,the cottage bungalow it checked off the,ep040
1386,most of the boxes it's like under our,ep040
1389,budget and we can have more room to do,ep040
1392,different things to it okay well this,ep040
1395,may not be something I say often ever in,ep040
1398,our relationship but I think you're,ep040
1401,right,ep040
1404,[Laughter],ep040
1407,we're gonna have to teach him not to,ep040
1410,take those sticks from our wood file,ep040
1413,we're very happy to be here we've been,ep040
1416,in the home for two weeks the house is,ep040
1419,priced at 3:13 and we ended up paying,ep040
1422,314 because there was a little bit of a,ep040
1425,bidding war for it maybe we could have,ep040
1428,like monthly movie nights or something,ep040
1431,I'm still struggling a little bit with,ep040
1434,the fact that this home doesn't hit my,ep040
1437,contemporary open concept I still have,ep040
1440,this idea of knocking out some of the,ep040
1443,space between the kitchen and the front,ep040
1446,living room but at the same time having,ep040
1449,it downstairs for football Sunday is,ep040
1452,really really nice and my collectible,ep040
1455,room is coming along great I'm still in,ep040
1458,the process of setting it up something,ep040
1461,that we can do is take down this wall,ep040
1464,okay here I'm fortunate that my niece is,ep040
1467,an interior designer and I immediately,ep040
1470,sassed her please help me with this,ep040
1473,closet bathroom combo reposition this,ep040
1476,vanity over here ideally I'd like to,ep040
1479,have it so that it's large enough for,ep040
1482,both of us which might not be,ep040
1485,so you're gonna garden it is absolutely,ep040
1488,our home we've been looking and,ep040
1491,searching and we finally found what we,ep040
1494,want and we love it thanks for coming,ep040
1497,out to see our new place,ep040
1500,[Applause],ep040
12,Wow look at this this is very nice that,ep041
15,there's a stairwell right next to the,ep041
18,door you feel the energy going Jack and,ep041
21,Anna are on the hunt in Cincinnati and,ep041
24,they have a unique take on houses wow,ep041
27,I'm in such a shower you just come out,ep041
30,here and characterize but while Jack,ep041
33,wants move-in ready and open concept,ep041
36,it's not quite open concept Greg,ep041
39,I mean it's open over there Donna's more,ep041
42,open to renovation I would probably want,ep041
45,to change that and since he's hung up on,ep041
48,her dress numbers doesn't even add up to,ep041
51,an even number it has no eight it's not,ep041
54,lucky for us at all and she insists on,ep041
57,houses that aren't too old this is so,ep041
60,creepy,ep041
63,this hunt could get complicated Vincent,ep041
66,the remnants of a castle think about all,ep041
69,the conversations to get out with all,ep041
72,this break conversations about what,ep041
75,[Music],ep041
78,who's your favorite I'm Jack I am an,ep041
81,Operations Manager working for a large,ep041
84,consumer packaged goods company I'm Anna,ep041
87,and I work as a Quality Manager and we,ep041
90,work at the same company currently we,ep041
93,live in Cincinnati here's a penny for,ep041
96,you,ep041
99,can I make the West price necklace we've,ep041
102,been married eight years now and have a,ep041
105,three-year-old Sophia from tiny country,ep041
108,called Moldova,ep041
111,she is really close-knit with her family,ep041
114,and there's a lot of family values that,ep041
117,she brings to us I love that part about,ep041
120,her he's very passionate he doesn't,ep041
123,really give up which can be good and bad,ep041
126,I learn along the process and in the end,ep041
129,that's right that's what it's about it's,ep041
132,a learning experience for us all we,ep041
135,lived in Cincinnati from 2009 to 2014,ep041
138,our company relocated us to Kansas City,ep041
141,but now they both have promotions and,ep041
144,the company is bringing them back to,ep041
147,Cincinnati there's a lot of history in,ep041
150,Cincinnati Cincinnati is where a lot of,ep041
153,pork resides so you might hear,ep041
156,Cincinnati refer to this porkopolis,ep041
159,there is a Flying Pig marathon that,ep041
162,happens every very famous you wouldn't,ep041
165,necessarily find that elsewhere no but,ep041
168,it is a charming partisans very charming,ep041
171,now they're ready to get out of their,ep041
174,temporary rental and settle down here in,ep041
177,a home for good the question is what,ep041
180,kind the style of home I'm looking for,ep041
183,is in George and with brick,ep041
186,on the front okay we're gonna fight over,ep041
189,the leg break yeah this is what I'm,ep041
192,talking about,ep041
195,this just screams the following to me I,ep041
198,prefer colonial because they're very,ep041
201,symmetrical Jordan is a colonial by the,ep041
204,way I'm impressed that Jack actually,ep041
207,knows what a Georgian is very stately,ep041
210,could be colonial - it's my colonial I,ep041
213,love it look at the shutters perfectly,ep041
216,symmetrical beautiful and she wants her,ep041
219,colonial to be on a quiet Street unlike,ep041
222,their current place,ep041
225,you cannot enjoy a walk and peace you,ep041
228,can hear the road so much life is so,ep041
231,busy and so hectic all the time you want,ep041
234,to come back somewhere where you don't,ep041
237,you know here on ambulance every five,ep041
240,"minutes excuse me our budget is 500,000",ep041
243,for a turnkey house because I don't want,ep041
246,to be spending a lot of time trying to,ep041
249,make a house work for us I don't mind a,ep041
252,sound let minor renovations I'd like to,ep041
255,put my own stamp on a home,ep041
258,I love charm but I also don't like when,ep041
261,a home is older than maybe 50 years,ep041
264,because then my superstitious,ep041
267,personality kicks in this home is a,ep041
270,hundred and something there's a ghost,ep041
273,named IRA though there isn't just a few,ep041
276,seconds she lives in our room issues to,ep041
279,get out she pointed her out to me Oh,ep041
282,Lord,ep041
285,Jack has a few very specific needs of,ep041
288,his own in Asian culture the number,ep041
291,eight is a symbol of really good fortune,ep041
294,so I look at the address but as it's a,ep041
297,DIF it multiplies to eight at the very,ep041
300,least it has to add up to an even number,ep041
303,the other thing is when you have stairs,ep041
306,right in front of the door that means,ep041
309,that you have your good energy leaving,ep041
312,the house out the front door,ep041
315,I love flow so that open concept is what,ep041
318,I'm looking for in a house I do love,ep041
321,hardwood floors it just gives it a very,ep041
324,comforting feel I'm really looking for a,ep041
327,chef's kitchen I love when there is a,ep041
330,big island we really need again thank,ep041
333,you we'd love to entertain and we need,ep041
336,to have a yard to be able to do that,ep041
339,when it comes to grilling that is my job,ep041
342,yes I intend to be able to expand that,ep041
345,skill set with a bigger deck first up a,ep041
348,home with colonial touches for honor it,ep041
351,does look pretty symmetrical so I think,ep041
354,I will like that not a Georgian got,ep041
357,painted brick though brick I really like,ep041
360,the house number yes yeah we have a,ep041
363,number and do you hear anything it's,ep041
366,pretty quiet out here - hi Greg hi how,ep041
369,you doing - great to see you great to,ep041
372,see you - I think you're really gonna,ep041
375,like this house it features four,ep041
378,bedrooms three full bathroom,ep041
381,one half bathroom built in 1963 that's a,ep041
384,little older than the 15 years that I,ep041
387,was looking for it's right on the cusp,ep041
390,it's 54 years old I think you'll like,ep041
393,the current ask price it's four hundred,ep041
396,eighty two thousand five hundred dollars,ep041
399,that's right at budget and a little bit,ep041
402,under I think that'll be good for our,ep041
405,checkbooks here in Cincinnati,ep041
408,it is a seller's market so when you're,ep041
411,looking for a house you're gonna have to,ep041
414,make a decision pretty quickly this is,ep041
417,very nice,ep041
420,there's a stairwell right next to the,ep041
423,door can you feel the energy going but,ep041
426,it's kind of on the side and it's pretty,ep041
429,yeah it's not quite open-concept Greg,ep041
432,it's someone over there but we're gonna,ep041
435,have to break down that wall in order to,ep041
438,see the kitchen it's something we can,ep041
441,consider I think this flow works well,ep041
444,though that window I'm really loving,ep041
447,that I mean can you imagine having,ep041
450,family dinners here one thing I don't,ep041
453,like is that it doesn't have hardwood,ep041
456,floors throughout I know and I think,ep041
459,that something would have to definitely,ep041
462,change I'm hearing project I'm hearing,ep041
465,money things I don't want to see but you,ep041
468,get that window,ep041
471,this is I thought you'd really like this,ep041
474,checked I think we could have some,ep041
477,really great parties and gatherings here,ep041
480,this is beautiful I really loved it from,ep041
483,the deck they head back in to see the,ep041
486,kitchen this needs some work but it's,ep041
489,got a lot of potential look at this I'm,ep041
492,like a sardine and again I can't I don't,ep041
495,know why jack is so worked up about it,ep041
498,this house is under budget and I feel,ep041
501,like we can still do the renovation and,ep041
504,come up on top there's way too much,ep041
507,stuff going on in this kitchen for me I,ep041
510,want a house that's ready to move in the,ep041
513,thing for me is that it doesn't have the,ep041
516,gas cooktop and then that's a,ep041
519,deal-breaker I must have a gas good tub,ep041
522,they passed from the kitchen to the,ep041
525,family room I can't get past the fact,ep041
528,that we just don't have hardwood,ep041
531,throughout the first floor with this,ep041
534,which I don't even know what it is it's,ep041
537,a floor you can change they head,ep041
540,upstairs to see a full bath and three of,ep041
543,the four bedrooms this could really work,ep041
546,for Sophia I do like that it has,ep041
549,hardwood floors look at this closet this,ep041
552,is amazing next they check out the,ep041
555,master suite came up to the master,ep041
558,bedroom and here is the bathroom,ep041
561,hello well this is that open concept you,ep041
564,want to Jack they check out the finished,ep041
567,basement complete with an office and,ep041
570,bathroom I like it I didn't know this,ep041
573,house is a little older it feels like,ep041
576,it's it's that good energy for out the,ep041
579,kitchen needs a lot of work and I can,ep041
582,really make it into that dream kitchen,ep041
585,I've been looking for what I see is the,ep041
588,upside and the lot itself is really nice,ep041
591,the inside needs a lot of work and I,ep041
594,really don't want this but we are a,ep041
597,little bit under budget next up is a,ep041
600,more move-in-ready home for Jack but it,ep041
603,might mean some compromises for on its,ep041
606,old and,ep041
609,I can hear all this noise and it costs,ep041
612,more money,ep041
615,[Music],ep041
618,do you like guys friends don't like guys,ep041
621,scream Allah and Jack are returning to,ep041
624,their favorite city Cincinnati Ohio with,ep041
627,"a budget of $500,000 they want a house",ep041
630,big enough for their growing family so,ep041
633,far they've seen a house with some,ep041
636,colonial touches for honor but Jack,ep041
639,thought it needed too much work so today,ep041
642,they're seeing one that's been,ep041
645,completely updated it's not a Georgia,ep041
648,it's more of a traditional I do like the,ep041
651,shutters,ep041
654,but this noise I'm not sure why Greg,ep041
657,brought us to this house it's so noisy,ep041
660,the house number doesn't have an 8 in it,ep041
663,but it has an even number good to see,ep041
666,you good to see ya thank you,ep041
669,this house is a hundred and forty-seven,ep041
672,years four bedrooms three full bathrooms,ep041
675,and one half bathroom the current ask,ep041
678,price is five hundred and five thousand,ep041
681,dollars whoa great that's at the top end,ep041
684,of our budget that's right it's old and,ep041
687,I can hear all this noise and it costs,ep041
690,more money so it's charming it's been,ep041
693,renovated keep an open mind and let's,ep041
696,check it out,ep041
699,oh wow this is harder what Greg it is,ep041
702,because the hardwood floors throughout,ep041
705,the first floor,ep041
708,yes it's open-concept Jack I really love,ep041
711,this staircase they don't face out of,ep041
714,the doors so all the good fortune stays,ep041
717,within the house you've got that window,ep041
720,seat right there and the one on the,ep041
723,other side and they're just so nice and,ep041
726,this fireplace this is a plus for me oh,ep041
729,wow these beams are they original they,ep041
732,are original to this house this is,ep041
735,amazing it's really that chef's kitchen,ep041
738,you're talking about yeah yeah I mean,ep041
741,look at this this is like restaurant,ep041
744,quality that's right that's why we make,ep041
747,fresh drink quality meals right oh look,ep041
750,at the strange oh wow I'm a little,ep041
753,bothered by this backsplash I would,ep041
756,probably want to change that I don't,ep041
759,know what honest talking about I mean,ep041
762,come on it's already at the top end of,ep041
765,our budget and I don't want to renovate,ep041
768,they passed through a small study and,ep041
771,into the family room I could really see,ep041
774,us using this space for Sophia and her,ep041
777,friends and our friends I think this,ep041
780,would be a nice entertaining area from,ep041
783,the family room they head outside to the,ep041
786,backyard Wow there's not really much of,ep041
789,the backyard here Greg and you don't,ep041
792,have a separation from your neighbors,ep041
795,either look look look dinner's ready,ep041
798,what is that in the back there that,ep041
801,would have been the original farmhouses,ep041
804,kitchen area it's actually on a,ep041
807,neighbor's property it's very nice,ep041
810,though it's open to it and you can see,ep041
813,it,ep041
816,I would agree they head upstairs to the,ep041
819,master bedroom,ep041
822,those built-ins it looks like you get,ep041
825,probably saw some dead bodies in there,ep041
828,it's beautifully done what does this,ep041
831,Greg is this door too,ep041
834,yeah oh wow such a shower you just come,ep041
837,out here and drive,ep041
840,also on this floor is a separate wing,ep041
843,with a study a full bath and a bedroom,ep041
846,what would this room be this should be a,ep041
849,fantastic bedroom for Sofia or C to,ep041
852,adore there's a nice door to the entire,ep041
855,space kind of think of this is Sophia,ep041
858,sweet my Sophia has more space than we,ep041
861,have that's a problem yeah it's very,ep041
864,cold,ep041
867,did you guys notice that a hundred and,ep041
870,forty seven years old of energy in this,ep041
873,house and then this room is so cold it's,ep041
876,all good energy guys maybe we should get,ep041
879,going,ep041
882,they check out the unfinished basement,ep041
885,wow this is so creepy,ep041
888,whoa and cold I don't think I want to be,ep041
891,in this on is saying it's cold and,ep041
894,creepy I just don't feel it this is not,ep041
897,a finished basement I think this is this,ep041
900,finished as it's gonna get,ep041
903,[Music],ep041
906,I do like the look that it has a,ep041
909,colonial so it doesn't have that earthy,ep041
912,brick that I really wanted to see it's a,ep041
915,trade up I was a bit disappointed in the,ep041
918,fact that there was no island if we have,ep041
921,to put in an island we're already at the,ep041
924,top of our budget here and the house,ep041
927,itself doesn't have a backyard that I,ep041
930,really like to have to be able to,ep041
933,entertain I just would like to see,ep041
936,something a little bit yeah you know on,ep041
939,the 40 plus next up is a younger house,ep041
942,for onna but it still has some issues,ep041
945,you know you kind of lost me there for a,ep041
948,second because of that car,ep041
951,[Music],ep041
954,yeah Jack and Anna want a bigger home,ep041
957,for their family and Cincinnati but Anna,ep041
960,wants a house she can renovate to her,ep041
963,taste and Jack wants move-in ready with,ep041
966,"a budget of $500,000 so far they've seen",ep041
969,a 1960s traditional with colonial,ep041
972,touches for Anna that needed some work,ep041
975,and a traditional that was renovated for,ep041
978,Jack but the 1880s era home was way over,ep041
981,honest 50-year aged look,ep041
984,so now their agent has lined up in 1970s,ep041
987,colonial for Anna I love it it's got the,ep041
990,columns it's so pretty,ep041
993,very symmetrical beautiful brick you,ep041
996,like it does have the brick but the,ep041
999,address doesn't even add up to an even,ep041
1002,number it has no eight it's not lucky,ep041
1005,for us at all it's really difficult to,ep041
1008,find a house for Jack that has an even,ep041
1011,number and has an 8 in it and it's a,ep041
1014,very difficult find this house was built,ep041
1017,in 1972 that's good it's a four bedroom,ep041
1020,four full bath house it's almost a full,ep041
1023,acre and it's fully fenced in the,ep041
1026,backyard right be there for a second,ep041
1029,because of that car from inside the,ep041
1032,house she can't hear any road noise okay,ep041
1035,"and the list price is $499,000 it's",ep041
1038,right at the top of our price range I'm,ep041
1041,not sure well let's see it I love the,ep041
1044,hardwood floors throughout I'm not too,ep041
1047,hot on the fact that the stairs are,ep041
1050,right next to the entrance when I open,ep041
1053,the door I feel like I'm gonna hit the,ep041
1056,stairwell yeah but see I love this,ep041
1059,staircase the wrought iron this is all,ep041
1062,very nice,ep041
1065,it doesn't feel open-concept to me I'm,ep041
1068,not sensing the flow here when you're,ep041
1071,dealing with traditional style houses,ep041
1074,that have kind of a colonial feel it's,ep041
1077,not gonna be a real open-concept plan I,ep041
1080,actually don't mind it let's check out,ep041
1083,the family room the character yes I do,ep041
1086,love the beams you know what I do love,ep041
1089,is this bar right here yeah yes,ep041
1092,something I've never had and I learn,ep041
1095,about this so one thing that the owner,ep041
1098,did was widened this door,ep041
1101,the kitchen look at this range it's gas,ep041
1104,this island hood this is great but this,ep041
1107,island is really for the stove tops,ep041
1110,unfortunately there's nothing else you,ep041
1113,can do with it I do love the stainless,ep041
1116,steel appliances I would like something,ep041
1119,that doesn't have dark countertops,ep041
1122,because these are so hard to clean mama,ep041
1125,keeps finding and pointing out things,ep041
1128,that she wants to renovate and fix and,ep041
1131,it's not really moving ready move-in,ep041
1134,ready is this they check out the formal,ep041
1137,dining room on the way to the patio my,ep041
1140,brick actually I know you don't like it,ep041
1143,but I love this what makes you feel like,ep041
1146,you're in the castle but do you hear,ep041
1149,we're not even gonna worry about that I,ep041
1152,mean look at the size of this thing,ep041
1155,I mean there's just so much space for,ep041
1158,Sophia to run in here we're gonna get,ep041
1161,the biggest bouncy house ever and have,ep041
1164,everybody go inside don't see kids yes,ep041
1167,they passed through the formal living,ep041
1170,room on the way to the second floor,ep041
1173,master suite,ep041
1176,it's got carpet yeah it's nice and plush,ep041
1179,though I feel like I'm walking on clouds,ep041
1182,this is great they check out the ensuite,ep041
1185,bathroom oh I like the detail of the,ep041
1188,shower it's clear that the owners put in,ep041
1191,some work in here they see three more,ep041
1194,bedrooms and a full bath before heading,ep041
1197,to the basement,ep041
1200,I think the remnants of a castle I like,ep041
1203,the brick oh and it's on this side oh,ep041
1206,yeah oh yeah it's all around here check,ep041
1209,out the rest of this area down here and,ep041
1212,think about all the conversations you,ep041
1215,get out with all this brick,ep041
1218,conversations about what nobody wants to,ep041
1221,talk about castles or at least not the,ep041
1224,ones in your basement there's not a lot,ep041
1227,of houses like this that's true it does,ep041
1230,have uniqueness to it but it does not,ep041
1233,add to appeal for me,ep041
1236,I love the curb appeal I love the fact,ep041
1239,that it's not brick on the outside but,ep041
1242,the address number doesn't even have an,ep041
1245,age adds up to an even number I don't,ep041
1248,know if I can make that work for me this,ep041
1251,feels move-in ready and I really like,ep041
1254,that but all the choices have been made,ep041
1257,for us so we don't we're at the top of,ep041
1260,our price range and we can't really,ep041
1263,change anything I do love the fact that,ep041
1266,it's a colonial the symmetry of the,ep041
1269,rooms on the first floor really appealed,ep041
1272,to me I love the backyard,ep041
1275,oh I could see us spending a lot of time,ep041
1278,out there very noisy that's something,ep041
1281,I'm not too excited about but since none,ep041
1284,of the houses has everything they want,ep041
1287,Jack and Anna will have to decide which,ep041
1290,of their must-haves they can live,ep041
1293,without I feel like we're gonna have to,ep041
1296,make some compromises Anna and Jack have,ep041
1299,looked at several houses in Cincinnati,ep041
1302,Ohio for their growing family now,ep041
1305,they're ready to make a decision listed,ep041
1308,"under budget at 480 $2,500 is a 1960s",ep041
1311,home with some colonial touches I really,ep041
1314,love looking out to it it had those,ep041
1317,beautiful trees up front the backyard,ep041
1320,was awesome really usable space it,ep041
1323,doesn't have hardwood floors throughout,ep041
1326,the entire house the stairwell was a,ep041
1329,little off to the side but it is to the,ep041
1332,front so that's a little bit of concern,ep041
1335,the address also doesn't have an 8 in,ep041
1338,there at the very least it hasn't even,ep041
1341,number that we can make work even though,ep041
1344,this home was only built in the 60s,ep041
1347,which is right along the lines of my,ep041
1350,fresh hold there right but it still had,ep041
1353,a littering that I was looking for but,ep041
1356,then you didn't have a guest still kept,ep041
1359,so that would be an expensive addition,ep041
1362,what do you think of the white brick,ep041
1365,traditional I really loved the charm,ep041
1368,that staircase was so beautifully done,ep041
1371,and the stairwell didn't go out the,ep041
1374,front door either I love that that house,ep041
1377,as hardwood floors,ep041
1380,I loved the breakfast area but then no,ep041
1383,island,ep041
1386,and had a really small dye code there's,ep041
1389,so much noise there,ep041
1392,it was way past the 50 year mark for me,ep041
1395,and it just kind of felt a little creepy,ep041
1398,and it's priced over a budget at 5:05 so,ep041
1401,what about the colonial house I love,ep041
1404,that it was a colonial affinely it's,ep041
1407,"listed at $499,000",ep041
1410,I love the brick on the outside and I,ep041
1413,also love the fact that the house is,ep041
1416,completely turnkey there's nothing that,ep041
1419,he would have to do some things do need,ep041
1422,to be changed what I didn't like is the,ep041
1425,stove top being right in the middle of,ep041
1428,an island,ep041
1431,remember the basement that's a unique,ep041
1434,piece that that only that house is gonna,ep041
1437,have I love the backyard,ep041
1440,I love how huge it is how open it is it,ep041
1443,was very nice but very noisy so which,ep041
1446,one will they choose,ep041
1449,[Music],ep041
1452,I think we should go with the 1960s,ep041
1455,tradition I'm really I agree it doesn't,ep041
1458,have everything I want,ep041
1461,it's not turnkey but I love the backyard,ep041
1464,of that house,ep041
1467,I mean I think it'd be perfect let's,ep041
1470,call Greg we closed in the house a month,ep041
1473,ago the house was listed at 480 to 5 but,ep041
1476,Greg really helped us and we were able,ep041
1479,to negotiate down to 460 85 we initially,ep041
1482,"budgeted $50,000 for the renovations but",ep041
1485,right now we're on track to spend over,ep041
1488,"15,000 above that budget we are going to",ep041
1491,reconfigure the kitchen we're also,ep041
1494,expanding all the hardwood throughout,ep041
1497,the house I really wanted a,ep041
1500,move-in-ready house but at the end I,ep041
1503,accepted the fact that we were gonna do,ep041
1506,some renovations it will help us get the,ep041
1509,house that we want we plan to move into,ep041
1512,the house within two months doesn't it,ep041
1515,feel like all you do I can't wait to see,ep041
1518,Sofia really grow up in this house we,ep041
1521,see a lot more entertaining with our,ep041
1524,friends and family here it's so nice to,ep041
1527,be outside and enjoy the nature we have,ep041
1530,that space now so that is really a new,ep041
1533,and great thing to look forward to,ep041
1536,[Music],ep041
12,the best feature is it's done,ep042

159,for us the timing worked out really well,ep042
162,that it's really just a fresh start for,ep042
165,our life and our family so you excited,ep042
168,to finally go see some homes definitely,ep042
171,they've been living in temporary housing,ep042
174,while they look for a new home my ideal,ep042
177,style would be a colonial style I really,ep042
180,love kind of the rich history look of it,ep042
183,just as huge grand looking house I don't,ep042
186,want my home to look like it's in a war,ep042
189,movie I mean I just,ep042
192,I appreciate the historic value I would,ep042
195,love a farmhouse style or Craftsman,ep042
198,style of homes and it just feels a,ep042
201,little more homey so a little different,ep042
204,type of home you're thinking of each of,ep042
207,you so how many bedrooms do you need,ep042
210,five or six five or six a lot of people,ep042
213,coming to visit we have a lot of,ep042
216,visitors we have an in-home gym we have,ep042
219,our son's bedroom he has a toy room we,ep042
222,are not having more children a lot of,ep042
225,stuff we could probably get rid of some,ep042
228,of that stuff get rid of our stuff,ep042
231,having five six bedrooms and four,ep042
234,bathrooms it's just far too much to keep,ep042
237,clean I've clean anyway you know vacuum,ep042
240,in my kitchen I really want a clean look,ep042
243,I would love white cabinets,ep042
246,I would love dark hardwood floors,ep042
249,throughout rather than the porcelain,ep042
252,tiles I would like a large island and,ep042
255,then an open floor plan out to the the,ep042
258,living room or the dining room she wants,ep042
261,the bigger house I would love to have a,ep042
264,bigger garage store all my toys and,ep042
267,tools get rid of them not getting rid of,ep042
270,our stuff having a large yard is,ep042
273,important for me it's always great for a,ep042
276,father and the son to go out and play,ep042
279,catching in a big yard it's important to,ep042
282,me that we have a pool it's kind of what,ep042
285,we're moving to Florida for is to spend,ep042
288,as much time outside as we can but that,ep042
291,is also another portion of the house,ep042
294,that I have to upkeep and keep clean,ep042
297,what I would prefer is more have a,ep042
300,functional outdoor space and possibly go,ep042
303,to a community pool or head down to the,ep042
306,"beach our range in budget is 300,000 to",ep042
309,"500,000 I definitely want some sweat",ep042
312,equity we can walk in with a fixer-upper,ep042
315,and make it our own make some money in,ep042
318,the long run I want to have a,ep042
321,move-in-ready house that with my new job,ep042
324,I don't have to spend all of my free,ep042
327,time doing projects this is our forever,ep042
330,house the past couple years have been a,ep042
333,lot of transition a lot of good and a,ep042
336,lot of bad we're ready to find a house,ep042
339,and,ep042
342,start our life over well it's cute but,ep042
345,what kind of style is it it's not really,ep042
348,a craftsman well it's definitely not the,ep042
351,colonial I was looking for I like the,ep042
354,kind of curb driveway here it reminds me,ep042
357,a lot of home alone or the pizza man,ep042
360,comes running in and keeps on hitting a,ep042
363,little statue in the way how's your,ep042
366,three-car garage it does have a,ep042
369,three-car garage for ninety nine nine,ep042

390,turbine test beautiful wood floors,ep042
393,fantastic stairway you know I like the,ep042
396,big statement but I think it's a little,ep042
399,dated it's not exactly my style is that,ep042
402,a pool I see that is a pool that's a,ep042
405,pool and we'll take a look at that and,ep042
408,just a little bit we're gonna see some,ep042
411,more of the house first okay okay,ep042

420,Wow look at all of this so beautiful I,ep042
423,love the appliances stainless steel they,ep042
426,look like they're high-quality what I,ep042
429,don't love is I was really hoping for,ep042
432,some white cabinets I mean we can,ep042
435,definitely paint those project we can do,ep042
438,in time I mean it's not something that,ep042
441,we have to do immediately move in check,ep042
444,out the pool Wow mase would love this,ep042
447,pool I don't know it's gonna be a little,ep042
450,bit of work to kind of upkeep it yeah,ep042

456,backyard where am I going to play ball,ep042

462,how open everything feels put some,ep042
465,barstools here barstools that we have,ep042
468,what do you think of the fireplace not,ep042
471,exactly my style it's a little more,ep042
474,modern but I appreciate that there is a,ep042
477,fireplace featured let's take a look at,ep042
480,the one of the bedrooms okay great good,ep042
483,size and it's got an ensuite bathroom,ep042
486,with a walk-in closet this were what we,ep042
489,great for some of our exercise equipment,ep042
492,yeah this would be a great gym so we're,ep042
495,gonna go upstairs four bedrooms there,ep042
498,it's far too many bedrooms we're gonna,ep042
501,need them,ep042
504,that's one more bedroom that I wanted,ep042
507,wow this is really cool an awesome,ep042
510,Overlook over the entire area let's go,ep042
513,check out the media room sounds good I,ep042
516,don't love this a would work well been,ep042
519,too painted I'd be fine oh I've got,ep042
522,enough on my plate yeah,ep042
525,oh wow look at this carpet carpet is in,ep042
528,rough shape and I really don't know,ep042
531,about this built-in bed situation they,ep042
534,see a shared bath and three more,ep042
537,bedrooms then head back downstairs to,ep042
540,see the master quad windows like these,ep042
543,French doors that open up to the pool,ep042
546,area the wallpapers got to go right away,ep042
549,walk-in closet here it's a decent size,ep042
552,it could always be bigger the water,ep042
555,closet flacks I don't think anyone's in,ep042
558,there but see what keys we can get,ep042
561,mm-hmm,ep042
564,doesn't everybody have a sauna I don't,ep042
567,know if we need that all right we need,ep042
570,to talk about this wallpaper for a,ep042
573,second this has got to go let's worst it,ep042
576,in the wallpaper in the master bedroom,ep042
579,the tile and the tub are fairly dated,ep042
582,not a huge fan of this ice cube type of,ep042
585,window either that's yeah that's half,ep042
588,the style all the time,ep042
591,I love how big the house is it's a ton,ep042
594,of room for our family to grow a ton of,ep042
597,potential for equity as we can make a,ep042
600,few updates it just seems too much for,ep042
603,us,ep042
606,it's really high on the budget,ep042
609,especially for all the projects that we,ep042
612,have maybe we can negotiate get the,ep042
615,price down some since budget is a,ep042
618,concern there agents lined up a much,ep042
621,less expensive place that also needs,ep042
624,some work,ep042
627,then take a breath do you imagine this,ep042
630,in someone's grandma's kitchen take it,ep042
633,in our kitchen that's cool,ep042
636,Minnesota transplants Ben and Amanda,ep042
639,"have a $500,000 budget for a new home in",ep042
642,sunny Tampa so far they've seen a home,ep042
645,that ticked most of Amanda's boxes six,ep042
648,bedrooms a fixer and a pool but almost,ep042
651,none of Ben's it's a nice neighborhood,ep042
654,yeah the drive up was was beautiful,ep042
657,there's a lot of mature trees convenient,ep042
660,location yeah good to see you again,ep042
663,you too it's a great home it's five,ep042
666,bedrooms three and a half baths as you,ep042
669,can see a three-car garage not quite our,ep042
672,style it seems like it's a spanish-style,ep042
675,ranch what'd you call it,ep042
678,it is a ranch but honestly the home was,ep042
681,really more for you it's gonna be a,ep042
684,little bit of a fixer it's got your pool,ep042
687,okay it's priced at four hundred two,ep042
690,thousand dollars it's been on the market,ep042
693,a little while so there's probably some,ep042
696,room in there ready go take a look,ep042
699,yeah go take a look come on get your,ep042
702,imagination on,ep042
705,and then take a breath here we are yeah,ep042
708,the crown molding it's pretty though,ep042
711,today's formal dining room tile I don't,ep042
714,love we can fix that let's take a look,ep042
717,at the first bedroom okay unicorns,ep042
720,unicorns in a lion may be a little bit,ep042
723,evil we could take that down we'd have,ep042
726,to replace the carpet but I do like the,ep042
729,shelves and the room is a decent size,ep042
732,from an office guest bedroom then we've,ep042
735,got a half bath here black toilet hmm,ep042
738,again imagination make it your own,ep042
741,plenty I could do in there here's the,ep042
744,formal living room it's a good-sized,ep042
747,face it's that nice light from the lanai,ep042
750,I do love the window and the lighting,ep042
753,this house is gonna need a ton of work,ep042
756,just looking at the floors they're all,ep042
759,bowed and dipping it's gonna be quite,ep042
762,the effort to grip all that up we can,ep042
765,give mason a sledgehammer he'd love it,ep042
768,yes exactly make it your own make it,ep042
771,your own let's go take a look at your,ep042
774,pool,ep042
777,suck why is the pool green,ep042
780,well what typically happens when we get,ep042
783,a lot of rain it dilutes the chlorine in,ep042
786,the pool then we can get a little algae,ep042
789,but it's an easy fix,ep042
792,Mason would love this cool you guys,ep042
795,gonna pull up my heartstrings don't ya,ep042
798,it looks like we still have a fairly,ep042
801,decent-sized yard,ep042
804,and it's beautiful I mean there's mature,ep042
807,trees I think the pool backyard,ep042
810,combination is a great compromise I,ep042
813,think we both win here this is the,ep042
816,laundry room garage,ep042
819,look at those cabinets whoo Wow okay,ep042
822,okay well it's stainless steel,ep042
825,appliances about all positive it would,ep042
828,be great if we could open that up and,ep042
831,it's a good space but we'd have to gut,ep042
834,it all and start over there's some good,ep042
837,but after a lot of work after a lot of,ep042
840,work I like it I don't think Amanda,ep042
843,really understands how much work is,ep042
846,gonna go into this house we're at a,ep042
849,stage in our life where we're gonna be,ep042
852,more busy it just makes a lot more sense,ep042
855,to go and find a house that's move-in,ep042
858,ready that we can enjoy right away I,ep042
861,love the fire well I don't love that,ep042
864,fireplace but I love that there is a,ep042
867,fireplace and I I mean I think it's a,ep042
870,good size and we could take out that,ep042
873,tile and put some nice brick on there,ep042
876,update it it's nice face built-ins they,ep042
879,see three bedrooms and two shared baths,ep042
882,every room has its own color theme so,ep042
885,now we're gonna go take a look at the,ep042
888,master bedroom suite you still with us,ep042
891,Ben yeah just barely just think of the,ep042
894,post get him on board think of the,ep042
897,possibilities good size it's a very good,ep042
900,size it's kind of narrow so we just have,ep042
903,to get creative and how we place this,ep042
906,furniture leads out to the pool sliding,ep042
909,glass doors yeah two walk-in closets,ep042
912,decent size for sure what do you think,ep042
915,Wow it's not a bad size your little,ep042
918,silent man I'm shocked really I mean,ep042
921,you've got the idiot wallpaper and this,ep042
924,old kind of pool tile that looks right,ep042
927,out of a,ep042
930,no a fitness locker room from the 80s I,ep042
933,don't know well again you can make it,ep042
936,your own,ep042
939,yeah there's a ton of potential because,ep042
942,we would have to gut all of this every,ep042
945,room needs some bit of work everywhere,ep042
948,and I was really looking for something,ep042
951,that was more move-in ready that we can,ep042
954,enjoy right away a lot of work I can see,ep042
957,it happening there's a lot of room here,ep042
960,for some sweat equity and a good,ep042
963,investment the long run where it's price,ep042
966,now there should be some negotiation,ep042
969,that has been on the market a while and,ep042
972,there should be an opportunity to get a,ep042
975,good good price while Amanda tries to,ep042
978,sell ban on a fixer Doug has finally,ep042
981,lined up a move-in-ready home Craftsman,ep042
984,style I think it's cute,ep042
987,[Music],ep042
990,[Applause],ep042
993,[Music],ep042
996,amanda and been recently relocated from,ep042
999,Minnesota to Tampa and they have a,ep042
1002,"$500,000 budget for a new home she wants",ep042
1005,a big fixer with a pool he wants a,ep042
1008,smaller turnkey home with a big yard so,ep042
1011,far they've seen an extra big home with,ep042
1014,a pool priced at the top of their budget,ep042
1017,and a slightly smaller more affordable,ep042
1020,fixer that also had a pool today they're,ep042
1023,seeing a home a little bit farther,ep042
1026,outside of Tampa it's a cute,ep042
1029,neighborhood the neighborhood is nice it,ep042
1032,was kind of a haul to get out here,ep042
1035,though but it's a five-bedroom,ep042
1038,"three-bath 3,200 square feet a little",ep042
1041,bit bigger,ep042
1044,"okay the price $345,000 no way",ep042
1047,craftsman-style I think it's cute,ep042
1050,doesn't really have a WOW factor at all,ep042
1053,it's a couple of rectangles it's only a,ep042
1056,two-car garage well it's a two-car entry,ep042
1059,but it is three three bays so the,ep042
1062,additional Bay is a tandem so you have,ep042
1065,the same amount of space okay okay come,ep042
1068,on in colors first area we have here is,ep042
1071,a guest suite with a bedroom and a full,ep042
1074,bath have a bedroom for a guest bedroom,ep042
1077,now I mean it seems like it's away from,ep042
1080,everything else or I guess of a little,ep042
1083,bit of privacy good-size bathroom for,ep042
1086,yeah I guess so you see the flooring I,ep042
1089,don't love it I would prefer dark,ep042
1092,hardwood I don't think it's all that bad,ep042
1095,it's kind of got like a rustic kind of,ep042
1098,feel to it well this room was a flex,ep042
1101,room we used for dining a little office,ep042
1104,or game room this would be a nice game,ep042
1107,room media room just imagine Mason's,ep042
1110,toys all over yeah go straight turn into,ep042
1113,toy rooms so we've got a nice open,ep042
1116,kitchen to the family room all right I,ep042
1119,like the island my white cabinets just,ep042
1122,what she wanted yeah they're nice and,ep042
1125,modern I even like the handles and it's,ep042
1128,open yeah very definitely that's that's,ep042
1131,one of the key things we were looking,ep042
1134,for is that open floor plan,ep042
1137,take a look at the backyard all right,ep042
1140,I'm sad to see the backyard so here's,ep042
1143,the lanai screened-in keeps the bugs,ep042
1146,away yeah,ep042
1149,it's always good keeping the bugs away,ep042
1152,it's a great sized backyard I mean it'd,ep042
1155,be great for a mason I plan,ep042
1158,I'm disappointed there is no pool and,ep042
1161,Mason would be disappointed there is no,ep042
1164,pool but it's a good size and I love the,ep042
1167,trees it feels more like home,ep042
1170,there's a community pool and so that'll,ep042
1173,be good they head up to the second floor,ep042
1176,to see a bonus loft space three spare,ep042
1179,bedrooms and a shared bath then the,ep042
1182,master good size would fit really nicely,ep042
1185,dual walk-in closets yeah let's take a,ep042
1188,look at the master bathroom all right oh,ep042
1191,it's huge the best feature is it's done,ep042
1194,it is nice there's a few things that I,ep042
1197,would want to update in time I really,ep042
1200,like the fact that there's not a ton of,ep042
1203,projects that I need to do there's not a,ep042
1206,lot of ripping of things out so pool but,ep042
1209,you have a great backyard beautiful,ep042
1212,let's meet our garage and it's priced,ep042
1215,well it is that's probably the biggest,ep042
1218,selling point for me is that price tag,ep042
1221,you know it seems like we're getting a,ep042
1224,lot of bang for our buck over here,ep042
1227,after seeing several options it won't be,ep042
1230,an easy choice for Ben and Amanda their,ep042
1233,decision may come down to bedrooms,ep042
1236,condition and yard size I'm ready to,ep042
1239,just decide on the house under which one,ep042
1242,yeah,ep042
1245,[Music],ep042
1248,Amanda and Ben have seen how much house,ep042
1251,"$500,000 will get them in Tampa now it's",ep042
1254,time to decide the first house the,ep042
1257,Spanish contemporary 4.99,ep042
1260,but we got the most faced with it it was,ep042
1263,a little bit too big I think didn't have,ep042
1266,much of a yard for you but I had a huge,ep042
1269,truth amazing tonight I kind of really,ep042
1272,want a bigger yard and there are some,ep042
1275,updates that I'd want to do and it's,ep042
1278,really at the top of our price range so,ep042
1281,then there was the ranch the ranch that,ep042
1284,one was listed for 402 definitely my,ep042
1287,fixer-upper I think that I could have a,ep042
1290,lot of fun and creating our perfect,ep042
1293,dream home with that I mean we all,ep042
1296,starting new jobs we're gonna be busy,ep042
1299,you're gonna have to adjust down here I,ep042
1302,just don't know if it'd be time to do,ep042
1305,all those projects but it's a good,ep042
1308,compromise in the backyard you have your,ep042
1311,yard I have my pool and then we have the,ep042
1314,"craftsman at 345,000 that price I'm",ep042
1317,gonna be hard to beat yeah very hard to,ep042
1320,be a good sized yard it wasn't a pool,ep042
1323,though there was a community pool we,ep042
1326,could utilize the neighborhood was a,ep042
1329,great commute was a little tough to get,ep042
1332,to that great neighborhood but we won't,ep042
1335,have to do anything,ep042
1338,[Music],ep042
1341,so the craftsman great price is hard to,ep042
1344,beat but I know that Spanish,ep042
1347,contemporary you fell in love with the,ep042
1350,size of that house I think that could be,ep042
1353,the dream house that we could really,ep042
1356,stay in for a long time and have our,ep042
1359,life here in Florida right thank you,ep042
1362,right let's call Doug all right we put,ep042
1365,the offer in about two and half months,ep042
1368,ago and moved in three weeks ago the,ep042
1371,"house was listed for $499,000 some great",ep042
1374,deal at 475 we're still in the process,ep042
1377,of unpacking and doing some renovation,ep042
1380,so it's a little chaotic but we're,ep042
1383,having fun doing the projects and it's,ep042
1386,coming together great we've done a lot,ep042
1389,of painting almost every room in the,ep042
1392,house in our upstairs portion of the,ep042
1395,house we recarpet at every room we're,ep042
1398,gonna pull out all of these spindles so,ep042
1401,we're in the middle of replacing the,ep042
1404,benicar on the stairwell we're really,ep042
1407,giving gut that master bathroom and,ep042
1410,start over so that should be a fun long,ep042
1413,project I feel that I compromised on,ep042
1416,pretty much everything Amanda got the,ep042
1419,pool she got the larger house she got a,ep042
1422,house that needed projects I got the,ep042
1425,three-car garage,ep042
1428,and a happy family once some of these,ep042
1431,projects are buttoned up and we can take,ep042
1434,a deep breath and relax a little bit I,ep042
1437,think we're gonna start talking about,ep042
1440,expanding our family,ep042
1443,gotta fill up those extra rooms that we,ep042
1446,have,ep042
1449,this house means everything we went,ep042
1452,through a lot a lot good and a lot of,ep042
1455,bad and we just started this new chapter,ep042
1458,of our life and our family together and,ep042
1461,this house is a perfect representation,ep042
1464,of that definitely better around two and,ep042
1467,Romana,ep042
1470,definitely definitely,ep042
12,there's lots of things we'll miss I,ep043
15,won't miss the traffic no Nashvillians,ep043
18,Jessica and Nikki are investing in a,ep043
21,second space where they can take down,ep043
24,the pace I work for a health care,ep043
27,company my job is very demanding,ep043
30,and I teach personal finance and Jessica,ep043
33,talked me into this craziness buying a,ep043
36,vacation home in Italy's Garf and Yana,ep043
39,region is the stuff of dreams like we're,ep043
42,gonna prepay for years of vacation but,ep043
45,vacations are supposed to be relaxing,ep043
48,man my number one priorities,ep043
51,move-in-ready turnkey I could see some,ep043
54,great things if we don't find the right,ep043
57,house then no we're not you're gonna,ep043
60,settle,ep043
63,[Music],ep043
66,I was telling everyone at work and they,ep043
69,just think we're crazy we are kind of,ep043
72,crazy yeah Jessica I met when we were,ep043
75,doing community theater in Gonzales,ep043
78,Texas and she was so fun and so,ep043
81,energetic you know that was love at,ep043
84,first sight I really was there's that,ep043
87,spreadsheet that's got everything good,ep043
90,you know Jessica's an a-type personality,ep043
93,and so when we visited Italy a couple of,ep043
96,years back so you got really excited,ep043
99,about it started researching finding,ep043
102,DeLuca we're gonna get a little bit more,ep043
105,a village feel I think one of our goals,ep043
108,is to really slow down and the Garf,ep043
111,Indiana region is less crowded less,ep043
114,touristy again more relaxed once I saw,ep043
117,the affordability in Italy then I,ep043
120,thought well you know this better than,ep043
123,Florida,ep043
126,this is the place that's got that candle,ep043
129,that I like but while whirlwind Jessica,ep043
132,can lose herself in the planning Nicki's,ep043
135,anxieties are harder to set aside to me,ep043
138,it's a little bit nerve-racking you know,ep043
141,we've saved all this money and you know,ep043
144,to go and take a chance on buying a home,ep043
147,in Italy it's pretty scary you keep,ep043
150,buying things for a house that we don't,ep043
153,have yet and just a candle,ep043
156,jessica's much more relaxed you know she,ep043
159,has everything out on that spreadsheet,ep043
162,so after 30 years I'd feel like we put,ep043
165,in the work and the time and the funds,ep043
168,to really do this right that's right,ep043
171,soaked in Sun and steeped in tradition,ep043
174,the Garvin Jana region of Tuscany is,ep043
177,everything one would expect from an,ep043
180,Italian hilltop Oasis his region is,ep043
183,fairly secluded full of hilltop towns,ep043
186,with rural people and not terribly,ep043
189,touristy and there are lots of beautiful,ep043
192,buildings which are derelict old and so,ep043
195,the price range compared to middle,ep043
198,Tuscany in southern Tuscany northern,ep043
201,Tuscany's more attainable,ep043
204,Phil please bu I can see why you wanted,ep043
207,to meet here it's amazing,ep043
210,yes it is come on a most beautiful day,ep043
213,today so what are you looking for we'd,ep043
216,like to have at least two maybe three,ep043
219,bedrooms two baths because we want to,ep043
222,have guests who stay here sure we love a,ep043
225,place with a view very important very,ep043
228,important space yes and I would really,ep043
231,like some Tuscan charm so pretty old and,ep043
234,stolen yeah but hopefully with no,ep043
237,renovation something that's looking for,ep043
240,a turnkey right yes turnkey in my mind,ep043
243,we might have to do a little bit of,ep043
246,renovation to get it close to the budget,ep043
249,of course and your budget is one hundred,ep043
252,and twenty thousand US dollars yes,ep043
255,that's going to be rather challenging,ep043
258,without the renovation we can't manage a,ep043
261,renovation from nashville tennessee over,ep043
264,in italy so to me that would be a,ep043
267,deal-breaker,ep043
270,since renovation is what scares Nicky,ep043
273,the most Phillip makes ready to occupy a,ep043
276,priority for house one buongiorno,ep043
279,buongiorno his first house meets Nicky's,ep043
282,criteria of a turnkey hey Nicky look at,ep043
285,that value,ep043
288,oh wow did you wake up to this every,ep043
291,morning it's a fully restored house,ep043
294,three bedrooms okay,ep043
297,and one bathroom one that means and how,ep043
300,"much is this one this is 150,000 I",ep043
303,thought you might say that to show you,ep043
306,what the the cost of doing a proper,ep043
309,renovation let's keep an open mind okay,ep043
312,okay and see how we go okay yeah,ep043
315,[Music],ep043
318,they're beautiful just as babies yeah,ep043
321,I've got the new and the old right you,ep043
324,can see the chestnut beam is old and yet,ep043
327,the owners have put a certain amount of,ep043
330,modernist to their house yes well I like,ep043
333,the fact that it's got a gas stove yes,ep043
336,and plenty of working space yes,ep043
339,absolutely,ep043
342,my first impression was you know it's,ep043
345,immaculate it really into the,ep043
348,instigation in advancement and is this,ep043
351,like the living room or the lounge,ep043
354,living room lounge yeah everything can,ep043
357,just continue so but yes and that beams,ep043
360,the industrial yes so does the furniture,ep043
363,come with the house yes furniture it,ep043
366,really is kind of small,ep043
369,yeah it may be a little too modern for,ep043
372,my taste and I would really prefer,ep043
375,something a little more quaint but the,ep043
378,skylights are really pretty oh my god,ep043
381,that's their remote control and that's,ep043
384,why the house is quite cool oh very nice,ep043
387,I think the workmanship is unbelievable,ep043
390,we are moving on to the main bedroom,ep043
393,still not a fan of the furniture to me,ep043
396,again up here it's very modern I was,ep043
399,surprised by the smaller living spaces,ep043
402,smaller bedrooms it's the only bathroom,ep043
405,right yes the owner goes okay,ep043
408,what's nice and it's very clean nice big,ep043
411,yep there's not another shower yeah yeah,ep043
414,it's designed to give that minimalist,ep043
417,look as you can see I understand and it,ep043
420,you know it's it's fine,ep043
423,I think he's so opposed to doing a,ep043
426,renovation that he might really want,ep043
429,this house,ep043
432,but sometimes it's difficult to know,ep043
435,what he's thinking it is very very nice,ep043
438,and that view you cannot oh my god and,ep043
441,it's all ready to go no work to be done,ep043
444,no work what's whatsoever well that's,ep043
447,that's good but then the price the price,ep043
450,it is turnkey but the price is just yes,ep043
453,Philip lowers the cost and ups the ante,ep043
456,this would be the perfect lifestyle if,ep043
459,you think so,ep043
462,I know speak very good English we don't,ep043
465,speak very good Italian okay Jessica and,ep043
468,Nikki are on the hunt for an affordable,ep043
471,property in the verdant Garvin Yano,ep043
474,region of Tuscany maybe they'll help no,ep043
477,thank you I got it and after 30 years of,ep043
480,marriage they're still nudging each,ep043
483,other toward new experiences it was,ep043
486,Jessica's idea to buy house in Italy,ep043
489,I'm height challenged nah I mean not,ep043
492,that I wasn't ready to go but uh you,ep043
495,know,ep043
498,and buying a place in a foreign country,ep043
501,is just kind of a scary thought I'm a,ep043
504,little nervous I'll be right here behind,ep043
507,you I know climbing down back down the,ep043
510,tree you know thinking about buying this,ep043
513,house in Italy it's less scary to me but,ep043
516,I certainly understand please go the new,ep043
519,and the old the thought of an overseas,ep043
522,renovation really scares Nicky who's,ep043
525,number one wish is turnkey,ep043
528,it's very nice it's all ready to go so,ep043
531,there's a furniture come with the house,ep043
534,yes but it's low on Tuscan charm for,ep043
537,Jessica and it's over budget,ep043
540,it is turnkey but the price is just yes,ep043
543,you want me to go first,ep043
546,it just looks so far down when you get,ep043
549,here but you're all spent in baby gear,ep043
552,okay I have a boss at work who says,ep043
555,perfection is the enemy of good because,ep043
558,if you wait until things are perfect you,ep043
561,will wait your entire life and not be,ep043
564,able to do it,ep043
567,[Music],ep043
570,[Applause],ep043
573,[Music],ep043
576,okay since they're getting more,ep043
579,comfortable taking risks Phillip takes a,ep043
582,bit of a chance himself with a property,ep043
585,that turns up the charm and takes down,ep043
588,the cost but it's going to require some,ep043
591,imagination holy cow come on guys fail,ep043
594,this looks like a renovation project,ep043
597,project yes yeah,ep043
600,the property is beautiful yes but oh my,ep043
603,gosh it's beautiful in five minutes from,ep043
606,San Ramon oh so you can walk to the,ep043
609,village,ep043
612,yes and like the the vineyard is that,ep043
615,it's part of the property and he,ep043
618,produces wine oh yes can you imagine for,ep043
621,the house it's three bedrooms two,ep043
624,bathrooms and possible kitchen possible,ep043
627,kitchen we have to have a kitchen no,ep043
630,it's not so how much for the price of,ep043
633,"the house and the vineyard is 80,000",ep043
636,"80,000 the leaves 40,000 for renovation",ep043
639,yes well I can't wait to see this oh my,ep043
642,goodness what do you think Nikki I think,ep043
645,this is a total renovation field yes man,ep043
648,you know a toefield that I really didn't,ep043
651,want a renovation and then he shows us a,ep043
654,big renovation here you have a sitting,ep043
657,area and a big panoramic window right,ep043
660,there,ep043
663,Vicky doesn't really curse but I think,ep043
666,he has a lot of like little asterisks,ep043
669,and squiggly lines above his head I,ep043
672,could see some great things,ep043
675,no you,ep043
678,I know you can this is the terrace it's,ep043
681,a secure space and of you there's two,ep043
684,things on our list right,ep043
687,Oh Nicki and Jessica we kept talking,ep043
690,about the Tuscan dream and this is a,ep043
693,basically a Tuscan dream oh so this is,ep043
696,where they make the why yes Nicki if you,ep043
699,think about it we could redo the house,ep043
702,portion and we could leave the wine,ep043
705,production here yes and then there's,ep043
708,another room here that we could also use,ep043
711,maybe as in shock to sell the wine from,ep043
714,here and cheeses and local products,ep043
717,right artists she can already see,ep043
720,everything you know she that's just the,ep043
723,way she is and she's such an optimistic,ep043
726,person we're going from well the,ep043
729,vineyard part is I would love to have a,ep043
732,vineyard but I'm not you know that was,ep043
735,it scary so we could have a house on,ep043
738,this land with a vineyard this yield,ep043
741,eighty thousand us,ep043
744,I would only leave twenty thousand full,ep043
747,restoration restoration yes give or take,ep043
750,a few dollars probably more giving than,ep043
753,taking yes,ep043
756,[Music],ep043
759,without you from you tennessee nashville,ep043
762,tennessee is it is good whiskey Jessica,ep043
765,and Nikki are chasing their dream of a,ep043
768,home in the Garvin Jana region of,ep043
771,Tuscany in our mind we kind of have this,ep043
774,vision of what life is going to be like,ep043
777,in Italy this is a bid although they,ep043
780,reject a bid order below the is what,ep043
783,product of residual those who do you,ep043
786,know Lucas International Association for,ep043
789,the raw food ok I'm a little concerned,ep043
792,that the reality won't live up to the,ep043
795,fantasy or to what we've built up in our,ep043
798,mind as the image of what life is going,ep043
801,to be like here oh my gosh Oh even more,ep043
804,he keeps bringing more and more food oh,ep043
807,my gosh houses one and two are as,ep043
810,different as they could possibly be it's,ep043
813,designed why like a New York atrium,ep043
816,right look it is very nice it's all,ep043
819,ready to go so we could have a house,ep043
822,with a vineyard this vineyard eighty,ep043
825,thousand give or take a few dollars,ep043
828,probably more giving than taking,ep043
831,but can you imagine you know it's still,ep043
834,kind of scary with everything but you,ep043
837,know I think it's gonna be a great,ep043
840,change of pace was like the slow food,ep043
843,that's right,ep043
846,[Music],ep043
849,Philip knows that what gives the,ep043
852,garfinger region its unique charm and,ep043
855,affordability is its abundance of older,ep043
858,properties but that means renovation so,ep043
861,he'll have to show them something that,ep043
864,captures Jessica's imagination as much,ep043
867,as house 2 did without scaring Nicky off,ep043
870,[Music],ep043
873,yes and this is the house gosh what are,ep043
876,the signs for well it's an abundant,ep043
879,restoration project Oh another,ep043
882,renovation feel this houses three,ep043
885,bedrooms two bathrooms and the present,ep043
888,is a hundred thousand hundred thousand,ep043
891,so it's under budget it is depending on,ep043
894,how much renovation work would have to,ep043
897,be yes I think the neighborhood has the,ep043
900,charm that we're looking for but it's a,ep043
903,little close started you like the idea,ep043
906,of a standalone house versus a village,ep043
909,house well this is a surprise I was not,ep043
912,expecting this from outside were you,ep043
915,know so this parts been renovated yeah,ep043
918,this is finished,ep043
921,well the electrics from you the plumbing,ep043
924,is new this is really cute there's a,ep043
927,really nice mix of modern and authentic,ep043
930,so this is kind of where the work stops,ep043
933,right but it still doesn't need all that,ep043
936,much work but now that I've seen these,ep043
939,homes I know we probably can't find,ep043
942,anything in our budget that doesn't need,ep043
945,at least some renovation but the,ep043
948,renovation is dis Aires Miguel this is,ep043
951,one of the bedrooms this is big dinky,ep043
954,this huge bedroom I like the high,ep043
957,ceilings smoothly oh my goodness oh wow,ep043
960,Nicky come look at this it's gonna work,ep043
963,your story no no look at this Wow that's,ep043
966,right I think she likes the bedroom,ep043
969,because I know she loves the view but I,ep043
972,think it's gonna be just difficult to,ep043
975,handle partial renovation has a total,ep043
978,renovation this is the bathroom okay but,ep043
981,there's no toilet no see you sink yes,ep043
984,there are two bathrooms and there's,ep043
987,plumbing there but there's no fixtures,ep043
990,you know there's lots of work to be done,ep043
993,come on to the terrace this is the,ep043
996,ongoing renovation right here yes but,ep043
999,when it's all pointed and finished it'll,ep043
1002,look amazing I mean there's been so much,ep043
1005,work already done yes you know this one,ep043
1008,does have three bedrooms and two baths,ep043
1011,it's pretty scary again it's at least,ep043
1014,it's not a complete we got a lot of,ep043
1017,talking to do we did we can make that,ep043
1020,one whatever we wanted we could have a,ep043
1023,business out of there possibilities are,ep043
1026,endless but it is a total renovation,ep043
1029,Wow it has been a stressful week hasn't,ep043
1032,it has been oh my gosh Jessica and Nikki,ep043
1035,are Nashville natives who are looking,ep043
1038,for a home away from home in the,ep043
1041,bountiful Garf and Jana region of,ep043
1044,Tuscany but with Jessica's desire for,ep043
1047,rustic charm Nicki's fear of renovation,ep043
1050,and a budget set in stone it hasn't been,ep043
1053,a picnic house one is turnkey and ready,ep043
1056,to occupy which is just what nikki has,ep043
1059,always pushed for it's all ready to go,ep043
1062,no work to be done well it is turnkey,ep043
1065,but the prize sister's yes house 2 is,ep043
1068,way under budget because it's way under,ep043
1071,construction this is a total renovation,ep043
1074,field,ep043
1077,yes but it's intoxicating views and,ep043
1080,actual working vineyard are the stuff of,ep043
1083,Jessica's Tuscan dreams we're going from,ep043
1086,house to a to an entire industry right,ep043
1089,House 3 is a town house with a hidden,ep043
1092,view and charm for Jessica well this is,ep043
1095,a surprise,ep043
1098,I was not expecting this from outside,ep043
1101,were you no but the renovations stop at,ep043
1104,the first floor which doesn't thrill,ep043
1107,Nicki it's pretty scary again place this,ep043
1110,mountain total renovation,ep043
1113,[Music],ep043
1116,I think we need to get rid of the,ep043
1119,vineyard house just because I think it,ep043
1122,would I mean I can't see that we can,ep043
1125,make that one whatever we wanted we,ep043
1128,could have a business out of there,ep043
1131,possibilities are endless but it is a,ep043
1134,total renovation that's too much for me,ep043
1137,to to undertake so what did you think,ep043
1140,about the turnkey house it was turnkey,ep043
1143,[Laughter],ep043
1146,there's no remodeling no renovation,ep043
1149,nothing but it only had one bath and the,ep043
1152,bedrooms were really small they were I,ep043
1155,know but the view was on I mean it was,ep043
1158,just incredible,ep043
1161,it was beautiful oh my gosh but it was,ep043
1164,also way over budget,ep043
1167,that makes me kind of nervous going that,ep043
1170,far up so are you leaning toward the,ep043
1173,partial renovation new me sure I'm not,ep043
1176,gonna do a renovation in Italy well yeah,ep043
1179,most of the most of the the skeletal,ep043
1182,work is there the kitchen was,ep043
1185,unbelievable it was so lovely and quaint,ep043
1188,all those beans and that stone wall yeah,ep043
1191,was that was that was beautiful it was,ep043
1194,just mainly finishing the bathrooms and,ep043
1197,doing the outside work and if we can,ep043
1200,find the people that did the kitchen you,ep043
1203,know and if they could do the quality of,ep043
1206,the rest of the house that they did in,ep043
1209,the kitchen,ep043
1212,and you know I think that's a there,ep043
1215,would be the best choice for us really,ep043
1218,really I think I could live with that,ep043
1221,all right,ep043
1224,[Music],ep043
1227,yeah oh I just love the fact this is,ep043
1230,right next door its door oh my gosh,ep043
1233,we're very happy that we made this,ep043
1236,choice,ep043
1239,try this one what time is it,ep043
1242,it's not fully the renovation from,ep043
1245,overseas it hasn't been quite as bad as,ep043
1248,I thought it would be we want something,ep043
1251,that looks very vintage we want to keep,ep043
1254,these not that it's done yet right I,ep043
1257,think the biggest thing that's left is,ep043
1260,the pointing on the outside of the house,ep043
1263,but the craftsman and there they truly,ep043
1266,are artisans and the level of,ep043
1269,craftsmanship has been unbelievable look,ep043
1272,at that our first cup of coffee,ep043
1275,in the house and that exciting as they,ep043
1278,complete the outside work and redo the,ep043
1281,terrace it's gonna be just wonderful to,ep043
1284,sit out there every day it's,ep043
1287,exhilarating to live here look it's,ep043
1290,dirty with pebbles it is everybody is so,ep043
1293,friendly they all speak to you guys you,ep043
1296,know,ep043
1299,ask you how you doing and,ep043
1302,I'm just I'm okay but yeah I'm not,ep043
1305,really sure how to say it all yet but,ep043
1308,we're great,ep043
12,there's a a family adventure is taking,ep044
15,Paul Kate and the entire family to the,ep044
18,Republic of Ecuador we spent almost a,ep044
21,year sailing in the Caribbean so we're,ep044
24,excited to get back to the ocean,ep044
27,crazy anchor and hoist the main and,ep044
30,monta promises to deliver everything,ep044
33,they're looking for homes on the beach,ep044
36,are at a bargain this is amazing,ep044
39,Paul is super good at anything he does,ep044
42,he helps me get out of my comfort zone,ep044
45,she's my trophy wife once they can put,ep044
48,their differences aside it is right in,ep044
51,town too many neighbors too close I,ep044
54,think we could jump off the balcony into,ep044
57,the pool and Kate's always up for a good,ep044
60,time,ep044
63,[Music],ep044
66,we have four children does anybody need,ep044
69,the car this evening Jack and Emily both,ep044
72,go to college hearing these huh I'm,ep044
75,working on my genetics,ep044
78,you're awfully smart you know we adopted,ep044
81,to you right Lucy's just getting ready,ep044
84,for her senior year in high school and,ep044
87,then our youngest is Noah what about,ep044
90,homework yeah I'm all caught up on,ep044
93,homework you are oh great promise we,ep044
96,decide on Manta because we want to be,ep044
99,near the ocean I've spent a lot of time,ep044
102,in Ecuador and I want the kids to,ep044
105,experience something like that there,ep044
108,will be a lot of new things for us to,ep044
111,see and new people to meet the plan is,ep044
114,to kind of transition into it you know,ep044
117,we're looking to the future and as the,ep044
120,kids get older Kate and I can't leave,ep044
123,here and move down there on a permanent,ep044
126,basis but with school it would be hard,ep044
129,to move down there full-time right now,ep044
132,I'm just interested to be able to live,ep044
135,in a completely different culture as a,ep044
138,transactional attorney my business is,ep044
141,gonna take a hit while I'm gone I'm a,ep044
144,registered nurse and I probably won't,ep044
147,work at a hospital there are you up for,ep044
150,it,ep044
153,um there's some things I'm a little,ep044
156,nervous about whatever Ben Samanta and I,ep044
159,don't speak Spanish anywhere near as,ep044
162,well as call but there are always,ep044
165,reasons not to do things so at some,ep044
168,point you just have to jump in and just,ep044
171,figure it out the city of Monta is,ep044
174,actually known Fortuna which is the main,ep044
177,commerce here hi it has actually noticed,ep044
180,a tuna capital of the world it is the,ep044
183,largest coastal city in Ecuador yet the,ep044
186,mountains on one side you get the ocean,ep044
189,on the other that ocean looks good the,ep044
192,city of Monta has a growing number of,ep044
195,new projects that have come into town,ep044
198,recently regular homes luxury homes,ep044
201,beach homes condos everything and it is,ep044
204,growing by leaps and bounds every day,ep044
207,the current real estate market is,ep044
210,probably one of the best buyers market,ep044
213,that we've seen in about five years,ep044
216,who homes on the beach or at a bargain,ep044
219,compared to what they would be for,ep044
222,example in South Florida and it's giving,ep044
225,people the opportunity to be able to,ep044
228,live the lifestyle that they want to,ep044
231,live with,ep044
234,having to pay the tab for it we have,ep044
237,four kids they won't always be here,ep044
240,every time but we would love to have,ep044
243,three bedrooms at least a couple,ep044
246,bathrooms we want to be on the beach you,ep044
249,know with an ocean view we want to be a,ep044
252,little further outside of the city to,ep044
255,have some privacy I don't really want to,ep044
258,compromise too much in that all I think,ep044
261,really likes to be more to himself and,ep044
264,I'm okay be in the city job things for,ep044
267,the kids to do right around us because,ep044
270,we won't have a car so it'd be nice to,ep044
273,be able to walk around to get to things,ep044
276,we need to get to and of course the,ep044
279,magic question is what's the budget we'd,ep044
282,like to stay within three hundred and,ep044
285,fifty thousand yeah so the dream home,ep044
288,and the dream budget Paul wants,ep044
291,something a little bit outside the city,ep044
294,location is San Tamara Nita which is,ep044
297,about 15 20 minutes south of Monta but,ep044
300,it doesn't have a lot of the amenities,ep044
303,that Kate is looking for wow it's really,ep044
306,amazing yes it's beautiful we're kind of,ep044
309,far from the city though yeah you're,ep044
312,about 15 20 minutes outside of town I,ep044
315,don't know about that we have four,ep044
318,bedrooms seven bathrooms did you say,ep044
321,seven seven bathrooms yeah oh and it's,ep044
324,for sale at three hundred and sixty,ep044
327,thousand dollars okay so a little above,ep044
330,our budget but that's a good price oh,ep044
333,wow it's really nice and here modern,ep044
336,it's new it is new construction the,ep044
339,house is probably about a year old,ep044
342,floating staircase and that's the quartz,ep044
345,accent wall oh that's pretty,ep044
348,is this a washer and dryer actually no,ep044
351,the washer and dryer is around the,ep044
354,corner outside what outside outside,ep044
357,that's weird that's a lot of laundry for,ep044
360,six of us and outdoors is not very,ep044
363,convenient you've got a private balcony,ep044
366,oh wow you can see all the way up the,ep044
369,beach is that a whale out there I think,ep044
372,it might be but I feel like it's kind of,ep044
375,far away from the city yeah I like this,ep044
378,I think for what it is it's his horrific,ep044
381,price look at that shower that's the,ep044
384,kind of shower where you're spend an,ep044
387,hour there and won't want to get out,ep044
390,yeah I've never seen a shower like that,ep044
393,wow that's pretty,ep044
396,and here's another upstairs bedroom tons,ep044
399,of storage private balcony another great,ep044
402,room and every bedroom has a bathroom,ep044
405,there's a lot of bathrooms the house is,ep044
408,actually being sold fully furnished so,ep044
411,all the furniture you see is included no,ep044
414,kidding,ep044
417,welcome to the outside wow this pool is,ep044
420,great this is where you'd probably spend,ep044
423,most of your time somewhat pool bar and,ep044
426,then you even have a custom grilling,ep044
429,section as well what about beach access,ep044
432,beach access is literally right down,ep044
435,this set of stairs oh oh right onto the,ep044
438,beach it just keeps getting better when,ep044
441,the weather's good we can open up these,ep044
444,glass doors and just have an indoor,ep044
447,outdoor experience there's a lot of,ep044
450,glass it's a lot of glass to clean this,ep044
453,house I think Kate sees this house is a,ep044
456,big house to take care of but I think,ep044
459,it's great I don't love the outside,ep044
462,laundry I think that's gonna be kind of,ep044
465,a pain I don't love that it's kind of,ep044
468,farther from the city then I was hoping,ep044
471,we don't have a car I feel like it's,ep044
474,kind of far away and since it's kind of,ep044
477,a new development there's not much out,ep044
480,here not a lot of amenities and not a,ep044
483,lot of people yet,ep044
486,I'm more happy with being further from,ep044
489,the city and the privacy and she has a,ep044
492,few concerns with it but I think we came,ep044
495,across the perfect place Kate finds the,ep044
498,perfect location in the heart of,ep044
501,downtown Monta pretty much anything you,ep044
504,want to do you can walk - oh it's,ep044
507,luxurious but condo living probably,ep044
510,won't cut it for Paul I just feel like,ep044
513,I'm too close to everybody right here,ep044
516,okay this is actually the main public,ep044
519,beach of Murcielago,ep044
522,I worry a little bit about the privacy,ep044
525,there there's so many different kinds of,ep044
528,plants I can't even keep track of them,ep044
531,the spirit of adventure is bringing the,ep044
534,Colton family from Utah to Ecuador we,ep044
537,have four children we spent almost a,ep044
540,year and sailing in the Caribbean but,ep044
543,not everyone is on board with the plan,ep044
546,I'm not as adventurous as him and Keyes,ep044
549,helped me get out of my comfort zone I,ep044
552,feel a little bit nervous going,ep044
555,somewhere I've never been I don't know,ep044
558,what I'm gonna do about the spinach,ep044
561,because I took French you know we're,ep044
564,looking to the future and as the kids,ep044
567,get older Kate and I kids leave here and,ep044
570,move down there on a permanent basis but,ep044
573,with the kids with school it would be,ep044
576,hard to move down there full-time and,ep044
579,with a limited income Kate and Ryan will,ep044
582,need to manage their extensive wish list,ep044
585,we want to be on the beach you know with,ep044
588,an ocean view want to be a little,ep044
591,further outside of the city to have some,ep044
594,privacy but be nice to be able to walk,ep044
597,around to get to things for the kids to,ep044
600,do right around us we do as much,ep044
603,researching as we can but that doesn't,ep044
606,take the place of actually jumping in,ep044
609,and just figuring it out we have four,ep044
612,bedrooms seven bathrooms did you say,ep044
615,seven oh seven bathrooms yeah oh,ep044
618,is this a washer and dryer actually no,ep044
621,the Washington dryer is around the,ep044
624,corner outside that's weird it is away,ep044
627,from the city and not a lot of the,ep044
630,things nearby for the kids to do Paul,ep044
633,reminds me of the old school gentleman,ep044
636,type you know that type that always,ep044
639,wants to keep their wife happy but at,ep044
642,the same time if you find something that,ep044
645,he really wants he'll fight for it so,ep044
648,our strategy for choosing this property,ep044
651,was to really give them that wow factor,ep044
654,it's within walking distance to the new,ep044
657,mall all the amenities Kate really wants,ep044
660,Wow beautiful,ep044
663,this is bar none the most affluent most,ep044
666,opulent building in the entire city it's,ep044
669,located right on murciélago beach you,ep044
672,have the brand new luxury shopping mall,ep044
675,brain a movie theater,ep044
678,pretty much anything you want to do you,ep044
681,can walk to that's really convenient,ep044
684,when we don't have a car it's a,ep044
687,three-bedroom three-bath,ep044
690,it's bracelet only 350 thousand dollars,ep044
693,so wait till you see this ah this is,ep044
696,amazing oh it's beautiful this kitchen,ep044
699,is so beautiful look at these granite,ep044
702,countertops step this way and you'll see,ep044
705,the bedrooms I don't think I've ever,ep044
708,seen anything like that,ep044
711,that's his so gonna be a little noisy,ep044
714,maybe without a full wall there the kids,ep044
717,may hear us and four up in the room and,ep044
720,they're downstairs or vice versa they'd,ep044
723,be okay with it I think what about,ep044
726,laundry room it's our laundry room,ep044
729,around here is a larger room it's inside,ep044
732,it's right to that door over there,ep044
735,oh nice that's convenient why don't we,ep044
738,got here yeah another beautiful guest,ep044
741,room there's still might be a little,ep044
744,noise problem from the family room to,ep044
747,this room it's beautiful room let's go,ep044
750,check out their view okay okay ah that,ep044
753,is beautiful,ep044
756,oh oh yeah this is great so close to the,ep044
759,beach the beach is right here it is a,ep044
762,nice beach it seems there are a lot of,ep044
765,people on the beach they're not quite as,ep044
768,much privacy this is actually the main,ep044
771,public beach of Murcielago,ep044
774,there's soccer games to pick up on the,ep044
777,beach so the kids can meet a lot of,ep044
780,extra people - OH,ep044
783,likes to be more to himself but I like,ep044
786,being closer to the city and around,ep044
789,people and that might be a little tricky,ep044
792,making a decision because we both want,ep044
795,to love what we choose these are cool,ep044
798,stairs yeah and then here you have a,ep044
801,really nice entertainment area for the,ep044
804,kids this is a fun little spot I'm not,ep044
807,sure that all fit they like to stretch,ep044
810,out Kate likes the property a lot but,ep044
813,the truth of the matter is our kids,ep044
816,would trash this place right here's your,ep044
819,master this is so unique that you can,ep044
822,have a balcony inside of your bedroom,ep044
825,inside of your house that's really,ep044
828,really different yeah I'm a little bit,ep044
831,concerned about the sound throughout the,ep044
834,house yeah it looks a little bit small,ep044
837,for a master about a bit yeah yeah you,ep044
840,look good in the shower,ep044
843,oh my thank you everybody likes the,ep044
846,bathrooms but Kate's the first client,ep044
849,we've had that's actually gotten into,ep044
852,the shower now is this gonna be big,ep044
855,enough for the kids yeah handle this,ep044
858,that's a great spot also with this,ep044
861,condominium you have a private gym here,ep044
864,you have a very big Jacuzzi here that's,ep044
867,great,ep044
870,all right here and you know it's so nice,ep044
873,that it's right here in town the kids,ep044
876,can meet a lot of people around here,ep044
879,luxurious more it might be a little too,ep044
882,much I don't know we can be kind of hard,ep044
885,on properties the unit feels a little,ep044
888,bit small it's not a private pool we are,ep044
891,close to the public beach so I worry a,ep044
894,little bit about the privacy there yeah,ep044
897,but I really like,ep044
900,finally some middle ground that's a nice,ep044
903,laundry room that's great with a family,ep044
906,of six I think we can jump off the,ep044
909,balcony into the pool what does the,ep044
912,compromise miss the mark is it a duplex,ep044
915,it is a duplex yes you do have a,ep044
918,neighbor right next door and can someone,ep044
921,else build right in front of us obstruct,ep044
924,the view there we go crazy and hoist the,ep044
927,main ever since Kate Paul and the kids,ep044
930,sailed the Caribbean,ep044
933,they've been itching to get back to,ep044
936,paradise remember when we would have,ep044
939,dolphins following us when they're,ep044
942,jumping off the bow Paul's a little more,ep044
945,impulsive I might think it through a,ep044
948,little bit more but I think he helps me,ep044
951,get out of my comfort zone Balan cater,ep044
954,definitely the adventure-seeking couple,ep044
957,almost to the point of they want to jump,ep044
960,before they actually looked at,ep044
963,everything their wish list is is a,ep044
966,pretty big one they really want the best,ep044
969,of everything oh wow you can see all the,ep044
972,way up to beach is that a whale out,ep044
975,there I think it might be yeah I like,ep044
978,this we're kind of far from the city,ep044
981,though yeah you're about 15 20 minutes,ep044
984,outside of town there are aspects of,ep044
987,this house that are no-win situation,ep044
990,mainly being that it's away from the,ep044
993,city nice for the kids to have a lot of,ep044
996,options to do,ep044
999,so this brings back some memories some,ep044
1002,good ones and some not so when it comes,ep044
1005,right down to it I think that Paul being,ep044
1008,such a gentleman I think he might just,ep044
1011,let Kate have her wish this is bar none,ep044
1014,the most affluent most opulent building,ep044
1017,in the entire city pretty much anything,ep044
1020,you want to do you can walk to and,ep044
1023,that's really convenient when we don't,ep044
1026,have a car I don't necessarily want to,ep044
1029,live in a condo complex I just feel like,ep044
1032,I'm too close to everybody right here,ep044
1035,I think if Paul were here on his own he,ep044
1038,probably would not buy this home he does,ep044
1041,have a few concerns with the privacy,ep044
1044,issues but I really like this house for,ep044
1047,the next home our strategy is gonna be,ep044
1050,to find a home close to town but not too,ep044
1053,far out beach access and it's gonna be,ep044
1056,perfect for them this is a larger,ep044
1059,development it has a ton of amenities as,ep044
1062,well not only do you have your own,ep044
1065,private pool but you also have a,ep044
1068,clubhouse area with multiple pools sauna,ep044
1071,and then for the kids has anything from,ep044
1074,a skate park ramp mountain biking,ep044
1077,walking trails tennis soccer oh you name,ep044
1080,it family kids would have plenty to run,ep044
1083,around and do is it a duplex it is a,ep044
1086,duplex yes you do have a neighbor right,ep044
1089,next door this is three bedrooms three,ep044
1092,and a half baths and what's the price,ep044
1095,for this one this is under your budget,ep044
1098,at just three hundred and thirty five,ep044
1101,thousand okay Wow that sounds good oh,ep044
1104,wow yeah this is of course the main,ep044
1107,focal point of the home you have a,ep044
1110,floating staircase encased in bamboo,ep044
1113,with a cork accent wall and if you look,ep044
1116,up there's a huge skylight up there that,ep044
1119,lets all the natural light flow through,ep044
1122,the home that's all right so this is,ep044
1125,your master suite,ep044
1128,get the recessed lighting but the LEDs,ep044
1131,are actually toggle so you can actually,ep044
1134,position them and then of course you're,ep044
1137,waking up to this beautiful view yet,ep044
1140,again,ep044
1143,the beach likes a little further away,ep044
1146,how do you get to the beach from here,ep044
1149,you don't have direct beach access but,ep044
1152,it's a pretty easy walk just write down,ep044
1155,those steps and you're on your way and,ep044
1158,can someone else build right in front of,ep044
1161,us at obstruct the view yes thank you,ep044
1164,really it is a concern if it might my,ep044
1167,block of view and there is one other,ep044
1170,cool thing about this balcony it leads,ep044
1173,right into your master bathroom,ep044
1176,oh nice you can get to the balcony from,ep044
1179,the bathroom that's interesting,ep044
1182,oh the shower is beautiful and then you,ep044
1185,turn around and you have your,ep044
1188,his-and-hers double sinks that's good,ep044
1191,this part of the staircase leads up to,ep044
1194,the guest floor and then here is the,ep044
1197,kids shared bathroom okay so one baths,ep044
1200,are on this level right I don't know,ep044
1203,about this bathroom it's not very big to,ep044
1206,begin with it's gonna be difficult for,ep044
1209,four kids to share one bathroom sure and,ep044
1212,then this is the first kids bedroom yes,ep044
1215,yeah when they're all here two of them,ep044
1218,will have to share this room they have a,ep044
1221,great ocean view and down here is your,ep044
1224,main living space okay that's pretty,ep044
1227,yeah that's a nice laundry room,ep044
1230,that's great with a family of six I love,ep044
1233,that Kate was most excited that the,ep044
1236,washer and dryer was inside the home,ep044
1239,this time so she didn't have to go,ep044
1242,outside and get her hair wet it seems a,ep044
1245,little bit confined what about a,ep044
1248,bathroom on this level there's actually,ep044
1251,a bathroom outside it's for the pool,ep044
1254,area in this level or social bathroom is,ep044
1257,on the second level okay so the place I,ep044
1260,think we would hang out the most is the,ep044
1263,family Diana we would like to have both,ep044
1266,a laundry room and a bathroom indoors,ep044
1269,crazy but yes it's a cute little pool,ep044
1272,for the two of us I think we'd get jump,ep044
1275,off the balcony into the pool,ep044
1278,yikes somebody might get hurt I'm sure,ep044
1281,the kids will try it at least once or,ep044
1284,twice but it's better than a kick in the,ep044
1287,pants true that point I don't know about,ep044
1290,the three levels and it feels a little,ep044
1293,tight down here on the main living level,ep044
1296,I think you'll be spending majority more,ep044
1299,time yeah probably down the beach yeah I,ep044
1302,like,ep044
1305,this community the kids have a lot of,ep044
1308,things they could do around here but,ep044
1311,there were a lot of neighbors a lot of,ep044
1314,neighboring properties it may not be,ep044
1317,quite as far out of town as I might like,ep044
1320,I think in the next I'm coping your ears,ep044
1323,I was thinking all wants his privacy out,ep044
1326,of town so the standalone house has a,ep044
1329,lot of privacy it has a direct beach,ep044
1332,access,ep044
1335,well Kate's comfort zone is in the city,ep044
1338,center but the condo it's right in the,ep044
1341,city we can get anywhere we want to just,ep044
1344,by walking I really don't know which one,ep044
1347,to pick,ep044
1350,I can't believe we're really here Kate,ep044
1353,and Paul are looking for the perfect,ep044
1356,home in paradise my concern is that,ep044
1359,we're not going to be able to find all,ep044
1362,the things we want in one property we,ep044
1365,would love to be close to the ocean,ep044
1368,close to the beach I would like to be,ep044
1371,right on the beach,ep044
1374,I don't really want to compromise too,ep044
1377,much in that and a final decision could,ep044
1380,come down to location do you think the,ep044
1383,kids are ready for something like this,ep044
1386,again I think they would love it it'll,ep044
1389,be a bit of a battle but when it comes,ep044
1392,right down to it I think that Paul being,ep044
1395,such a gentleman I think he might just,ep044
1398,let Kate have her wish spacious house,ep044
1401,one puts Paul right where he wants to be,ep044
1404,it has a lot of privacy we have four,ep044
1407,bedrooms seven bathrooms oh that really,ep044
1410,surprises me it has a direct beach,ep044
1413,access so I don't whale up there but I,ep044
1416,didn't love that the laundry was outside,ep044
1419,and you know it's a little bit further,ep044
1422,away from the city like 15 minute drive,ep044
1425,the condo right in town we don't have a,ep044
1428,car pretty much anything you want to do,ep044
1431,you can walk to it has a pool but it's,ep044
1434,not a private pool,ep044
1437,and I worry a little bit about the,ep044
1440,privacy there and also there the noise,ep044
1443,concerns in the condo yeah but I really,ep044
1446,like this house under budget house three,ep044
1449,bridges the gap but will it be enough,ep044
1452,this is a larger development it has a,ep044
1455,ton of amenities as well kids would have,ep044
1458,plenty to run around and do,ep044
1461,that's a nice laundry room but I think,ep044
1464,it's a little bit small for a family of,ep044
1467,six we could jump off the balcony into,ep044
1470,the pool yes I think you'll be spending,ep044
1473,majority of your time probably down the,ep044
1476,beach,ep044
1479,[Music],ep044
1482,if I was to eliminate one I think it,ep044
1485,would be the duplex,ep044
1488,I mean it's under budget but for kids in,ep044
1491,my bathroom when they're here it would,ep044
1494,be a little tight yeah someone could,ep044
1497,build and block the ocean view right you,ep044
1500,just don't know right you know that,ep044
1503,condo it's so stunning and so unique,ep044
1506,it's nice for the kids to have a lot of,ep044
1509,options and things to do but the condo,ep044
1512,doesn't have private beach access and it,ep044
1515,has a pool but it's a community pool so,ep044
1518,the standalone it had four bedrooms,ep044
1521,seven bathrooms there's a private pool,ep044
1524,good sized private full and I think it,ep044
1527,has a lot of room for us to stretch out,ep044
1530,and really you know kind of enjoy,ep044
1533,ourselves as a family but you know I,ep044
1536,didn't love that the laundry was outside,ep044
1539,it's kind of odd and was over budget at,ep044
1542,"360,000 now the condo it's a beautiful",ep044
1545,place right on budget it's right in the,ep044
1548,city we can get anywhere we want to just,ep044
1551,by walking I knew that would be a big,ep044
1554,positive yeah I just felt like it was a,ep044
1557,little bit small yeah it was do you,ep044
1560,think you'd be willing to move a little,ep044
1563,bit further away from the city for four,ep044
1566,bedrooms seven bathrooms,ep044
1569,you know it might be worth it and that,ep044
1572,house is beautiful I love it how do you,ep044
1575,feel what's good the kids are gonna love,ep044
1578,it all right we have a lot of fun here,ep044
1581,the kids are loving it the beach is,ep044
1584,great the pool is great there's a lot of,ep044
1587,sand in the house all the time and it's,ep044
1590,hard to keep clean that's true,ep044
1593,I thought the laundry might be a problem,ep044
1596,you know Thoreau said it really is not,ep044
1599,that a big deal at all,ep044
1602,nice throw jack where'd it go and unlike,ep044
1605,some of our past adventures this is a,ep044
1608,little bit more of an adjustment for the,ep044
1611,kids just because of the language,ep044
1614,barrier we've never seen anything like,ep044
1617,this before yeah it's called a yellow,ep044
1620,pattaya we do have to kind of plan ahead,ep044
1623,to call a taxi when we need to get to,ep044
1626,town but it actually hasn't been too bad,ep044
1629,this home purchase has satisfied our,ep044
1632,need for adventure right now,ep044
1635,[Music],ep044
12,Oh Shea Hillenbrand has more hustle than,ep045
15,ever,ep045
18,I played seven years in the major,ep045
21,leagues I was a two-time all-star and,ep045
24,currently I have a nonprofit foundation,ep045
27,we're establishing a baseball academy in,ep045
30,parts of India ASCO Mexico nice Shea and,ep045
33,his wife Kristin want to help dreams,ep045
36,come true on the field and realize their,ep045
39,own pleasant dreams,ep045
42,near the beach Edward is hideous but,ep045
45,that's Mexico right there I want to go,ep045
48,biggest and best around I got the goose,ep045
51,bumps right now John amazing I love this,ep045
54,he's the visionary he always wants to,ep045
57,shoot for the skies and I'm the one who,ep045
60,always has to reel and back and say no,ep045
63,we're stretching the budget a little bit,ep045
66,but I think you'll see the value of it,ep045
69,it's not that far over budget it's over,ep045
72,budget,ep045
75,[Music],ep045
78,this place has come a long ways and I,ep045
81,was younger this was just all dirt and,ep045
84,these were like little shacks or people,ep045
87,were selling stuff I love Puerto,ep045
90,peñasco I started going there when I,ep045
93,was about 12 years old with one of my,ep045
96,best friends now it's rodeo driver Dale,ep045
99,a drive just like Beverly Hills yes,ep045
102,Kristen drugged me down there I mean for,ep045
105,months she kept bugging me to go and,ep045
108,then the first trip going down to Puerto,ep045
111,peñasco we crossed the border and I,ep045
114,look over to my left and saw a baseball,ep045
117,stadium and I instantly had this vision,ep045
120,of I want to help the kids total okay,ep045
123,being a professional athlete and being,ep045
126,able to live my dreams what I found out,ep045
129,is the majority of people don't get to,ep045
132,live their dreams so we made contact,ep045
135,with the right people at the right time,ep045
138,and and now it's a really exciting,ep045
141,adventure to be able to give back,ep045
144,watching che doing this has really,ep045
147,taught me what a great role model we can,ep045
150,be for our kids we have our own kids,ep045
153,from different colleges and I'd really,ep045
156,want to make sure that we can take them,ep045
159,with us and build those memories in,ep045
162,Mexico just learning to give back Porto,ep045
165,piñas goes about three and a half hours,ep045
168,south of Phoenix it's on the Sea of,ep045
171,Cortez it's also known by Americans as,ep045
174,Rocky Point we love the beach the,ep045
177,laid-back lifestyle the culture they're,ep045
180,very loving people there and there's a,ep045
183,huge market for rentals down there so,ep045
186,I'm looking at this as an investment we,ep045
189,have to tap into our savings and it has,ep045
192,to make financial sense if we're going,ep045
195,to make the move so tell me a little bit,ep045
198,about what you're looking for well we,ep045
201,definitely have to have two bedrooms two,ep045
204,bathrooms,ep045
207,I prefer three bedrooms but we could,ep045
210,deal with two okay outdoor space is,ep045
213,really important to both of us,ep045
216,definitely I would love to have a big,ep045
219,Terrace a big outdoor space right we,ep045
222,have to have an ocean view that's my,ep045
225,number one priority so I would like to,ep045
228,be as close to the ocean as possible,ep045
231,okay and I personally prefer light,ep045
234,bright and modern I know that's tough to,ep045
237,find in Mexico yeah that is so tell me,ep045
240,more about your budget what are you,ep045
243,trying to achieve there I would like to,ep045
246,"stay at $300,000",ep045
249,she's the conservative one I'm the more,ep045
252,boisterous one an ad aspect and if we,ep045
255,have to go over that to get what we need,ep045
258,I'm willing to do that I just like,ep045
261,having a lot of space,ep045
264,okay so Shay with his past he has no,ep045
267,concept of money if Shay was in charge I,ep045
270,know we would end up with a,ep045
273,multi-million dollar penthouse with a,ep045
276,helicopter pad so I really have to work,ep045
279,hard to reel him in Shay and Kristen are,ep045
282,a little bit mixed on their budget and,ep045
285,although that's a good budget it still,ep045
288,will be a challenge because we're trying,ep045
291,to get them the best locations possible,ep045
294,and of course the size is very important,ep045
297,to them to accommodate their family,ep045
300,sensing some budget flexibility from,ep045
303,Shay John tests the possibilities with a,ep045
306,free-standing house that's ultra plush,ep045
309,and has plenty of space welcome to Casa,ep045
312,de tortuga guys Tortuga,ep045
315,turtle this is a three-bedroom,ep045
318,three-bath full custom home great,ep045
321,finishes wonderful views of the water it,ep045
324,has a great yard in the back set up for,ep045
327,a barbecue grill Plus on top of the,ep045
330,house is a beautiful margarita deck,ep045
333,perfect we're stretching the budget a,ep045
336,little bit at the price is 370 but I,ep045
339,think you'll see the value when we go,ep045
342,through it okay we're willing to take a,ep045
345,look let's take a look it concerns me,ep045
348,that the house is so far over budget,ep045
351,it's not that far over budget it's over,ep045
354,budget oh wow,ep045
357,amazing house huh look at these,ep045
360,absolutely huge sweeping ceilings I've,ep045
363,never seen a ceiling like that it's,ep045
366,beautiful these are all custom built all,ep045
369,backlighting in it so really is a,ep045
372,beautiful look at night this is awesome,ep045
375,I think that dome ceiling was absolutely,ep045
378,breathtaking overtaking the whole main,ep045
381,living area I do love the dome ceiling,ep045
384,as well I like the custom aspect of it a,ep045
387,spacious open kitchen the colors aren't,ep045
390,my favorite but you can tell those are,ep045
393,expensive cabinets and the granite is a,ep045
396,high-end granite I think this is perfect,ep045
399,I got the goose bumps right now job,ep045
402,right,ep045
405,I love this good I think Shay and I both,ep045
408,agree that we love the custom feel of,ep045
411,the home,ep045
414,however Shay doesn't mind going over the,ep045
417,budget I'm the numbers person and it has,ep045
420,to make financial sense the master,ep045
423,bedroom is right over here Wow,ep045
426,I do like the dome but that headboard is,ep045
429,hideous,ep045
432,that can come right off that is a built,ep045
435,in plaster Mexico right there that is,ep045
438,exactly what we need in Mexico all right,ep045
441,I'm not sleeping with a palm tree behind,ep045
444,my head but I love this I mean I didn't,ep045
447,think even expect a dome in here that's,ep045
450,amazing,ep045
453,a great view is wakin up again to the,ep045
456,water oh yeah that is beautiful,ep045
459,I absolutely love the master bedroom how,ep045
462,it opens up into the terrace out back,ep045
465,it's layered outdoor space out back,ep045
468,plenty of room for the barbecue,ep045
471,absolutely breathtaking I believe,ep045
474,Kristen likes this property overall with,ep045
477,the space that has three bedrooms two of,ep045
480,the bedrooms have ocean views and that,ep045
483,third bedroom has double bunk beds where,ep045
486,we could fit all the kids in one room I,ep045
489,do like all this custom work in here I,ep045
492,know she's concerned about the budget,ep045
495,but with the ideal property I don't even,ep045
498,think that should be even thought about,ep045
501,so here's your margarita deck look at,ep045
504,these views from here wow this is,ep045
507,amazing,ep045
510,it is beautiful absolutely really opens,ep045
513,it up once you get up here it looks like,ep045
516,there's some construction over here,ep045
519,there is construction going on so you,ep045
522,will lose this view point from here but,ep045
525,this will never change that's good to,ep045
528,know,ep045
531,man John this house is really really a,ep045
534,everything hit my wish list,ep045
537,I love the spacious inside it gives me,ep045
540,the Mexican feel I love how the dome,ep045
543,ceilings are has plenty of space to fit,ep045
546,the kids and right now the views are,ep045
549,great but what the building next door,ep045
552,that's like disappointing I can't,ep045
555,believe that because having those,ep045
558,oceanfront views is absolutely a must,ep045
561,for us absolutely well unfortunately,ep045
564,that's something that we can't control,ep045
567,and it's going to be a real deal we,ep045
570,don't know when it will be starting yeah,ep045
573,I do like an actual home versus the,ep045
576,condo complex but I would really like to,ep045
579,see a home that's closer to our budget,ep045
582,and I would like to be closer to the,ep045
585,ocean,ep045
588,welcome to the Sonoran spa resort,ep045
591,sitting right in the middle of sandy,ep045
594,beach so a great location here first,ep045
597,they're getting closer on price and,ep045
600,closer to the beach but will it be,ep045
603,enough this is a little bit over your,ep045
606,budget but I think you'll see the value,ep045
609,in it will be all right if we go over,ep045
612,budget she's such a stickler with the,ep045
615,numbers and I wish she would be able to,ep045
618,understand where I'm coming from,ep045
621,[Music],ep045
624,it's amazing the hill and brands are in,ep045
627,Kristin's childhood getaway of Puerto,ep045
630,Penasco Mexico to bring Jays baseball,ep045
633,philanthropy to life,ep045
636,this is Melek on the old port with all,ep045
639,the shopping I love that area and then,ep045
642,in the distance you can see sandy beach,ep045
645,Shae and Kristin are just absolutely the,ep045
648,type of people that we long to see come,ep045
651,in invest in Puerto peñasco which ones,ep045
654,you like Kristin came here when she was,ep045
657,younger and they are now focusing on,ep045
660,doing community service which is just,ep045
663,absolutely amazing like this one here,ep045
666,Shae is a very loving kind-hearted,ep045
669,person he loves giving but he has no,ep045
672,concept of finance well how about a,ep045
675,monkey since I played major league,ep045
678,baseball I still have a little bit of,ep045
681,that mindset that where whatever you put,ep045
684,your eyes on you can purchase I have a,ep045
687,thinking background and it's very,ep045
690,important to me and I want to make sure,ep045
693,we're in a good financial position we're,ep045
696,able to afford what we purchase oh wow,ep045
699,house 1 is the kind of luxurious digs,ep045
702,that Shay can't resist I've got the,ep045
705,goose bumps right now John they're,ep045
708,amazing I love this what the price makes,ep045
711,Kristen ball and there's trouble on the,ep045
714,horizon it looks like there's some,ep045
717,construction over here there is,ep045
720,construction going on so you will lose,ep045
723,this view point from here but,ep045
726,unfortunately that's something that we,ep045
729,can't control to get them closer to,ep045
732,everything they've been dreaming of John,ep045
735,takes them right to the water's edge but,ep045
738,the properties there don't come cheap,ep045
741,either,ep045
744,well welcome to the Sonoran fire resort,ep045
747,and right in the middle of sandy beach,ep045
750,so a great location here so what we have,ep045
753,here is a 2-bedroom 2-bath penthouse,ep045
756,suite and it has a huge outdoor patio,ep045
759,that you guys will just love for,ep045
762,entertaining,ep045
765,perfect this is priced at three hundred,ep045
768,and twenty thousand dollars a little bit,ep045
771,over your budget but I think when you,ep045
774,see the beautiful renovation that they,ep045
777,did I think you'll see the value in it,ep045
780,okay Shane I would disagree over the,ep045
783,price on this one he thinks we can go,ep045
786,over because it's right in the heart of,ep045
789,Sandy Beach but once again I don't love,ep045
792,that it's over budget Wow look at how,ep045
795,the views amazing I knew you'd love the,ep045
798,views and look at the colors that I,ep045
801,think you guys love it's white but it's,ep045
804,not quite finished not quite finished,ep045
807,but there's not much to go you have,ep045
810,brand new quartz countertops all new,ep045
813,flooring it's just absolutely beautiful,ep045
816,I don't like that it's not totally,ep045
819,finished it still has some work to be,ep045
822,done okay let's look into the open,ep045
825,living room here I don't know what John,ep045
828,this looks pretty tight well they do,ep045
831,have some very large furniture in here,ep045
834,and I think someday you could downsize,ep045
837,the furniture and you'll notice that,ep045
840,full wall of mirrors here it really,ep045
843,opens up this living space,ep045
846,most of our buyers here in Puerto,ep045
849,peñasco they live outdoors they enjoy,ep045
852,the outdoor space and key amenities,ep045
855,amazing pools restaurants ocean views I,ep045
858,mean it's really about that outdoor,ep045
861,space,ep045
864,Wow and look at this look at holy that,ep045
867,tide comes in it's beautiful and check,ep045
870,out the pool the grounds are spectacular,ep045
873,the view was absolutely breathtaking,ep045
876,being able to walked in and see the,ep045
879,ocean was that absolutely what we're,ep045
882,looking for,ep045
885,oh wow this is a nice master very Airy,ep045
888,again beachy look master bath there's no,ep045
891,mirrors in here John there's no mirrors,ep045
894,and there's no door or a door around the,ep045
897,toilet that's a good point,ep045
900,luckily there's plenty of room here to,ep045
903,put a door frame and a new door in here,ep045
906,I do like that it's two bedrooms and,ep045
909,it's two baths it is pretty much,ep045
912,furnished and there's ample outdoor,ep045
915,space check this out holy cow you,ep045
918,weren't joke and this thing is massive I,ep045
921,know this is just such a great,ep045
924,entertaining space well and it's got a,ep045
927,barbecue over here too this is what I,ep045
930,want absolutely that's what I wanted to,ep045
933,point out to you I think she loves this,ep045
936,property because it has his outdoor,ep045
939,space and you can't get closer to the,ep045
942,ocean than this I know he doesn't care,ep045
945,that it's over budget I know he's going,ep045
948,to say we can work with it it'll be,ep045
951,doable but I would really like to see,ep045
954,something under budget well I'm curious,ep045
957,this is a lot of condo here a lot of,ep045
960,great amenities what's your thoughts I,ep045
963,really love the outside Terrace I love,ep045
966,the barbecue that's my dream right there,ep045
969,the not just a barbecue but a full,ep045
972,kitchen I love that well I love the,ep045
975,modern finishes John but there is a lot,ep045
978,of work that needs to be done still,ep045
981,though they didn't quite finish it so,ep045
984,we'll have to take that on and it's,ep045
987,already over budget I know there's some,ep045
990,finishing touches that need to be put on,ep045
993,this condo but again that's gonna give,ep045
996,you more of a customization and I think,ep045
999,you guys will be really happy but let's,ep045
1002,uh let's take off and we'll take a look,ep045
1005,at the other property and let's do some,ep045
1008,comparisons all right okay sounds good,ep045
1011,John this is great it's a well thought,ep045
1014,over master plan community with amazing,ep045
1017,amenities I know Kristen loves being,ep045
1020,able to look at houses she loves to be,ep045
1023,able to number crunch but boy I'm,ep045
1026,getting tired of this let's just pick a,ep045
1029,place,ep045
1032,the mayor playing catch I just saw,ep045
1035,hundred right now retired Major League,ep045
1038,all-star Shea Hillenbrand and his wife,ep045
1041,Kristen are realizing his dream of,ep045
1044,giving back to the burgeoning beachfront,ep045
1047,community of Puerto Penasco Mexico like,ep045
1050,I envisioned it right now like a ton of,ep045
1053,kids out here and when you finish,ep045
1056,playing a professional sport the hardest,ep045
1059,thing to do is fill that competitive,ep045
1062,niche with something when we first,ep045
1065,visited Berta Penasco the thoughts that,ep045
1068,I had were we're wanting to give back to,ep045
1071,the kids and how I could help and how we,ep045
1074,could help as a team we're just really,ep045
1077,excited to be out here we truly,ep045
1080,appreciate it as you know the eastern,ep045
1083,side of Puerto peñasco or Rocky Point,ep045
1086,is not old but not new either as you can,ep045
1089,see around the neighborhood the,ep045
1092,infrastructure the the sports,ep045
1095,infrastructure is well not up to date if,ep045
1098,we want to call it something,ep045
1101,however our young population it's keep,ep045
1104,increasing its growing and I'm convinced,ep045
1107,that this feel whenever it's done is,ep045
1110,going to keep the children focused and,ep045
1113,who knows maybe eventually we're gonna,ep045
1116,be asking them for the autographs while,ep045
1119,they're in the major leagues yeah that'd,ep045
1122,be great,ep045
1125,but it'll be tough to help others,ep045
1128,without a home base of their own look at,ep045
1131,these views from here wow this is,ep045
1134,amazing house 1 is a luxury property,ep045
1137,that Shay loves with a price tag to,ep045
1140,match Shay doesn't understand from his,ep045
1143,previous life that budget is important,ep045
1146,check this out holy cow he's got a,ep045
1149,barbecue over here too this is what I,ep045
1152,want absolutely Wow,ep045
1155,he doesn't pay close attention to the,ep045
1158,dollars however I do and it needs to,ep045
1161,make financial sense for us,ep045
1164,there's just a lot of work that needs to,ep045
1167,be done still though they didn't quite,ep045
1170,finish it son and it's already over,ep045
1173,budget John knows that they both love,ep045
1176,the beach so he keeps to the resort area,ep045
1179,but to finally bring the price down for,ep045
1182,Kristen something will have to go this,ep045
1185,is great it's a well thought over master,ep045
1188,plan community with absolutely amazing,ep045
1191,amenities the unit that I'm showing you,ep045
1194,is a two-bedroom two-bath beachfront,ep045
1197,open plan and I think you're gonna like,ep045
1200,this on it's listed for 290 thousand,ep045
1203,just a little bit under your budget okay,ep045
1206,that sounds good knew that you would be,ep045
1209,pleased with that yes let's do it,ep045
1212,pretty cool nice I love the view so you,ep045
1215,can see this condo is immaculate granite,ep045
1218,countertops upgraded I like the,ep045
1221,appliances but I don't know about the,ep045
1224,color of everything they actually had,ep045
1227,this custom finished and I think they,ep045
1230,choose some very warm colors I like the,ep045
1233,colors it's like Mexico Mexico theme,ep045
1236,well I hate it,ep045
1239,its standard Mexico colors you know like,ep045
1242,it's pretty common for what you would,ep045
1245,see here so here's the master suite you,ep045
1248,can see great views of the water I love,ep045
1251,that you can lay in bed and look at the,ep045
1254,ocean it's pretty tight in here though,ep045
1257,well it's cozy I think if you lighten up,ep045
1260,the colors it would feel much more,ep045
1263,spacious as well I do like the colors,ep045
1266,myself that burgundy and the gold it's a,ep045
1269,manly color well you guys can work that,ep045
1272,out let's take a look at the master bath,ep045
1275,even though the property technically is,ep045
1278,turnkey it's under budget and that will,ep045
1281,give me a little bit of wiggle room to,ep045
1284,make the changes that I want to make Oh,ep045
1287,the shower is looking at the toilet you,ep045
1290,can go the bathroom and watch me take a,ep045
1293,shower there you go,ep045
1296,I don't know what's in Kristen's mind I,ep045
1299,don't know what she likes it I know she,ep045
1302,loves being able to look at houses she,ep045
1305,loves to be able to number crunch but,ep045
1308,boy I'm getting tired of this I'm,ep045
1311,getting tired of all the pros and cons,ep045
1314,and picking every place apart let's just,ep045
1317,pick a place so here's the views this,ep045
1320,view is exactly what we're looking for,ep045
1323,done love it yeah but I don't know if I,ep045
1326,want to be looking at Spring Breakers,ep045
1329,partying in the pool bar when I'm,ep045
1332,sitting on my balcony with my kids well,ep045
1335,that is a temporary season thank,ep045
1338,goodness so the outdoor space seems a,ep045
1341,little limited there's no area for me to,ep045
1344,barbeque right here on the patio with,ep045
1347,the kids that's correct but they do have,ep045
1350,some really nice facilities for,ep045
1353,barbecuing on the ground floor well I,ep045
1356,love it it's right there on the water it,ep045
1359,is 2 bedroom 2 bath and I love that it's,ep045
1362,under budget well the fact that it's,ep045
1365,under budget leaves you some extra money,ep045
1368,to decide what works the best yeah all,ep045
1371,right,ep045
1374,bold swings or conservative compromises,ep045
1377,and I don't know what decision is the,ep045
1380,right decision yeah I'm super torn it's,ep045
1383,gonna be a tough one for us drinks look,ep045
1386,amazing Kristen and Shay who come to,ep045
1389,Puerto peñasco so they can give back,ep045
1392,but they'll have to decide what kind of,ep045
1395,life they can afford to take on to do it,ep045
1398,let's go all right let's make a decision,ep045
1401,so the first one we looked at was the,ep045
1404,villa you really liked it it was pretty,ep045
1407,breathtaking,ep045
1410,with the domed ceilings the,ep045
1413,three-bedroom it has the outdoor area,ep045
1416,for me to be able to have my barbecue,ep045
1419,"yeah however it was $70,000 over budget",ep045
1422,yeah and they're building a condo,ep045
1425,complex and your back door basically,ep045
1428,right in the 2-bedroom 2-bath that was,ep045
1431,absolutely amazing,ep045
1434,but it was over budget and it wasn't,ep045
1437,totally finished there are still some,ep045
1440,things we needed to do and then the cozy,ep045
1443,condo this does have the same ocean,ep045
1446,views a kind of aha factor when you walk,ep045
1449,in the main door yeah that wasn't we,ep045
1452,were looking for but it didn't had,ep045
1455,around for the barbecue but it was under,ep045
1458,budget it was the only unit we saw that,ep045
1461,was under budget exactly right,ep045
1464,[Music],ep045
1467,I think we have to eliminate the villa,ep045
1470,because it's so far over budget and it,ep045
1473,doesn't have the ocean view that we're,ep045
1476,looking for it's it's my dream to be,ep045
1479,able to have something like that but,ep045
1482,that condo complex we don't know when,ep045
1485,it's gonna go in it might be 10 years,ep045
1488,might be whatever I will definitely Bend,ep045
1491,on that one for you thank you I'm,ep045
1494,leaning towards that penthouse I really,ep045
1497,like that the feel we got when we walked,ep045
1500,in the front door you'd have to agree,ep045
1503,with that,ep045
1506,it was pretty impressed taking but it's,ep045
1509,so far over budget and it's not finished,ep045
1512,we still have to do new appliances,ep045
1515,mirrors in the master bath there's no,ep045
1518,door in the master bathroom there's so,ep045
1521,much work to be done on that but that,ep045
1524,cozy condo it has the same ocean view I,ep045
1527,know it's a little bit tighter but it's,ep045
1530,under budget it's turnkey we can just,ep045
1533,come down here and start vacationing,ep045
1536,yeah you're right about that but I just,ep045
1539,want you to hear me out with this I love,ep045
1542,that Terrace that terrorist is,ep045
1545,absolutely amazing it's a family thing,ep045
1548,we're gonna spend a lot of time outside,ep045
1551,so having that huge Terrace that we,ep045
1554,didn't even know was gonna be a part of,ep045
1557,that condo with not only the barbecue,ep045
1560,outside built-in that I want but that,ep045
1563,white kitchen you know you like that,ep045
1566,white kitchen that's the white kitchen,ep045
1569,of your dreams coming down to Mexico,ep045
1572,coming down the birthda Penasco this is,ep045
1575,what the whole thing is about for us to,ep045

1587,like the terrace so let's do the path,ep045
1590,all right let's do it,ep045
1593,cheers Cheers to the calm to the pit,ep045
1596,house frosty over here but let's,ep045
1599,complain since we purchased the condo,ep045

15,friends for Floridians Jose and Amanda,ep046
18,the beach is like just about six blocks,ep046
21,from the ocean oh that's awesome,ep046
24,but while Jose dreams of a fixer-upper,ep046
27,by the ocean maybe tick down that wall,ep046
30,and we're gonna have that open floor,ep046
33,plan that I've always wanted now you,ep046
36,want to teach down walls all I hear are,ep046
39,dollar signs and having to live in a,ep046
42,construction zone Amanda's seat storage,ep046

93,into him at a bar and he was celebrating,ep046
96,that he had just gotten a job as a,ep046
99,firefighter and then it just kind of,ep046
102,became this moment where everything,ep046
105,around us just stopped and we were just,ep046
108,really consumed with each other and,ep046
111,really launched into where we are now we,ep046
114,just take the same way become best,ep046
117,friends,ep046
120,I came up to Jacksonville Beach for work,ep046
123,and I really fell in love with the,ep046
126,culture and the people this really nice,ep046
129,having the beach right at the backyard,ep046
132,Jose loves to surf and be out in the,ep046
135,water and I'll come out sometimes to the,ep046
138,air I just feel like it's kind of this,ep046
141,little like gem that hasn't really been,ep046
144,discovered yet but you have to get rid,ep046
147,of one surfboard what you bring one in,ep046
150,you gotta throw one out we live in 630,ep046
153,square feet of a little beach apartment,ep046
156,I think we've really outgrown it we're,ep046
159,looking for a two to three bedroom house,ep046
162,definitely two bathrooms our budgets,ep046
165,"$230,000 living inland is a",ep046
168,non-negotiable for me I've always wanted,ep046
171,something that near the water what I,ep046
174,love about being so close here to the,ep046
177,beach is that sometimes before work I,ep046
180,can go for a run before the Sun comes up,ep046
183,or work out when a Sun Goes Down and,ep046
186,it's just a relaxing feeling I think the,ep046
189,advantage of living inland is that you,ep046
192,could find a lot bigger homes I don't,ep046
195,want it too big I like the small little,ep046
198,living room it's just nice nice and cozy,ep046
201,well growing up my parents always move,ep046
204,from house to house and every house,ep046
207,always bigger than the last,ep046
210,and at some point house comes just so,ep046
213,big that we never really had that,ep046
216,quality family time well the style home,ep046
219,that I want is more of a beach bungalow,ep046
222,type,ep046
225,this is cute do you like so I really,ep046
228,would love to have a big Victorian house,ep046
231,really loves the character behind it but,ep046
234,crown molding the little doorknobs and,ep046
237,hardwood floors would just be really,ep046
240,awesome to plan I really wouldn't like,ep046
243,to find spaces I want it to be open and,ep046
246,for you to be able to like look from the,ep046
249,kitchen into the living room this is,ep046
252,like move-in-ready exactly what I would,ep046
255,be looking well we could change the,ep046
258,cabinet's but the Florida great,ep046
261,everything else looks great I don't want,ep046
264,to move into somebody else's personality,ep046
267,or somebody else's character I would,ep046
270,love to take on a fixer-upper,ep046
273,if it was a major fixer-upper that would,ep046
276,be non-negotiable for me I can't imagine,ep046
279,having to be living with the two dogs in,ep046
282,a construction zone for a couple weeks,ep046
285,backyard is a little small but deck is a,ep046
288,little small I'd be hard to entertain,ep046
291,guests I really want to go backyard deck,ep046
294,I really like the white cabinets see a,ep046
297,white kitchen to me it would be ideal I,ep046
300,prefer dark cabinets and granite,ep046
303,countertops it's a nerve-racking,ep046
306,experience this movie is to be exciting,ep046
309,can happen here we are this is your,ep046
312,typical beach bungalow not very,ep046
315,Victorian know if you're gonna find,ep046
318,Victorian at the beach it's a 2-bedroom,ep046
321,1-bath one bathroom will be an issue I,ep046
324,really know I know it's just about six,ep046
327,blocks from the ocean oh that's awesome,ep046
330,it's right at 850 square feet,ep046
333,the list price 225 I mean definitely the,ep046
336,price makes me a little worried because,ep046
339,it does look like it needs a lot of work,ep046
342,but six bucks let's take a look all,ep046
345,right,ep046
348,Wow well I like small cozy little,ep046
351,smaller than its definitely really small,ep046
354,and look at these floors I mean this is,ep046
357,just,ep046
360,we'd have to rip all of this out we,ep046
363,can't say that this is definitely a,ep046
366,project the owner had started a rehab,ep046
369,and decided to settle before he finished,ep046
372,so there's a lot of undone things in,ep046
375,this place well I was excited about a,ep046
378,fixer-upper,ep046
381,but it might be a little bit bigger of a,ep046
384,project than we expected,ep046
387,I do think that Jose seems a little bit,ep046
390,more nervous and he initially did when,ep046
393,he said he wanted a fixer-upper so we've,ep046
396,got this kitchen looking decent they've,ep046
399,done some updates in here what do you,ep046
402,think I mean my my initial thought is,ep046
405,that there's really no counter space in,ep046
408,here there's a little small board I do,ep046
411,like about it is that we can actually,ep046
414,maybe tick down that wall and you have,ep046
417,that open floor plan that I've always,ep046
420,wanted now you want to take down walls,ep046
423,not that big of a deal pretty easy fix,ep046
426,and I want to show you this utility room,ep046
429,you've got a tankless hot water heater,ep046
432,and a new electrical box that's a big,ep046
435,deal and we could definitely make this,ep046
438,into a pantry closet Yeah right now I'm,ep046
441,not really seeing my cereal next to,ep046
444,these machines across the kitchen,ep046
447,there's a laundry room there's some,ep046
450,great space in here this is almost like,ep046
453,another bedroom this is huge I,ep046
456,definitely see potential in here we,ep046
459,could even make this into another,ep046
462,bathroom and you should give us the two,ep046
465,two that we were looking for turning the,ep046
468,laundry room into the bathroom it's just,ep046
471,really scary to me it seems like it's,ep046
474,gonna be a really big project and I have,ep046
477,no idea what to expect so let's take a,ep046
480,look outside I think you're really gonna,ep046
483,like this backyard,ep046
486,it's is what I'm talking about look at,ep046
489,all this space for Jackson Luna they're,ep046
492,gonna love that I could totally see them,ep046
495,having a blast out here back inside they,ep046
498,see the bungalows only bathroom is this,ep046
501,oh my gosh I mean there's no walls yes,ep046
504,but this is the empty canvas I was,ep046
507,talking about we can start from scratch,ep046
510,all I hear are dollar signs and having,ep046
513,to live in a construction zone and we,ep046
516,just wouldn't even have a bathroom for a,ep046
519,couple days or weeks around the corner,ep046
522,from the bathroom they see the first,ep046
525,bedroom kind of the big windows I'm so,ep046
528,much light I mean the floor is just,ep046
531,there's nothing empty canvas there you,ep046
534,go,ep046
537,so guys let's go check out the master,ep046
540,this is kind of small to be a master I,ep046
543,feel like we could just extend our arms,ep046
546,it is a smaller house so the rooms are,ep046
549,gonna be smaller too we can open this,ep046
552,wall up and you'll go right into that,ep046
555,bathroom that's right but then that,ep046
558,takes away wall space and now another,ep046
561,construction project I mean that just is,ep046
564,a project project this is a project,ep046
567,Karen and Jose have all these grands,ep046
570,ideas about what to do that all I hear,ep046
573,it's just more money into renovations,ep046
576,and more projects and more unknowns they,ep046
579,just are dreamers and I'm just trying to,ep046
582,be realistic so tell me what you guys,ep046
585,think of the house well it's just not a,ep046
588,Victorian it's definitely really far,ep046
591,from the style that I was looking for,ep046
594,what is a great location we're a six,ep046
597,block beach but another issue is it's,ep046
600,only one bathroom we were looking for a,ep046
603,two backing place that is huge and it's,ep046
606,also complete rehab but I do want a,ep046
609,fixer-upper but this might be a little,ep046
612,too much since Amanda wants a home with,ep046
615,character Karen has lined one up but,ep046
618,Jose sees a problem you know we're like,ep046
621,30 minutes away from the ocean I'm,ep046
624,thinking maybe 20 you really think it's,ep046
627,30,ep046
630,I know it's 30,ep046
633,like those Jose and Amanda are tired of,ep046
636,cramped apartment living so with a 230,ep046
639,thousand dollar budget they're looking,ep046
642,for a home in Jacksonville Beach with,ep046
645,space to grow into Jose thinks beachside,ep046
648,living is the best but Amanda's not,ep046
651,convinced so far they've seen an 850,ep046
654,square foot beach bungalow six blocks,ep046
657,from the water but it only had one,ep046
660,bathroom and needed massive renovations,ep046
663,so their agent Karen is hoping to move,ep046
666,inland combined with more square footage,ep046
669,will win Amanda over so this is,ep046
672,historical Springfield we're on the,ep046
675,outskirts of downtown I do really love,ep046
678,the neighborhood it's very central it's,ep046
681,a kind of everything in Jacksonville you,ep046
684,know we're like 30 minutes away from the,ep046
687,ocean I think it may be 20 you really,ep046
690,think it's 30,ep046
693,I know it's 30 by the lack of salt in,ep046
696,the air I'm open to the idea of living,ep046
699,this far out from the beach it lets us,ep046
702,explore an area that we really don't,ep046
705,know about Jacksonville so it really,ep046
708,doesn't bother me that's too far any,ep046
711,location is a huge problem I came in,ep046
714,smell of salt in the air and that just,ep046
717,depresses me this is a craftsman it's,ep046
720,not really the Victorian that you were,ep046
723,looking for but we couldn't find that in,ep046
726,your price point this is a three-bedroom,ep046
729,two-and-a-half-bath house it's about,ep046
732,"2,300 square feet a little bit over that",ep046
735,it's like basically a new construction I,ep046
738,do really love that it has an old feel,ep046
741,has a lot of character that's a big,ep046
744,house it's listed for right at 250 but,ep046
747,it's been on the market for a long time,ep046
750,so I'm pretty sure there's some,ep046
753,negotiating there that can be done why,ep046
756,don't we go take a look oh my gosh I,ep046
759,love these floors,ep046
762,Lightwood it does make a difference when,ep046
765,you come inside it does feel very new,ep046
768,there's not a lot of old charm and,ep046
771,that's one thing that I definitely want,ep046
774,is I wanted our own character in the,ep046
777,house well come look at the kitchen area,ep046
780,and maybe that will sway you a little,ep046
783,bit so over here to the left is a half,ep046
786,bath it's a really good size okay good,ep046
789,size,ep046
792,so what do you think of the kitchen wow,ep046
795,this is really nice the cabinets are,ep046
798,really nice but I didn't want those,ep046
801,white cabinet paint I love the cabinets,ep046
804,I like the dark cabinets with the dark,ep046
807,granite countertops and with the gas,ep046
810,stove it looks that much better now this,ep046
813,to me is more your style I do really,ep046
816,like this space there's a lot of light,ep046
819,that comes in like that yeah great,ep046
822,windows yeah I love that it opens the,ep046
825,kitchen opens out into it so we could be,ep046
828,cooking and still watching TV,ep046
831,I really like that this house kind of,ep046
834,reminds me of the houses I grew up in,ep046
837,too much space for for a small family,ep046
840,let's take a look outside so we have the,ep046
843,outside here I think you're really gonna,ep046
846,like this I know y'all moving outside,ep046
849,Matt this is perfect for entertaining,ep046
852,yeah the doors we have a barbecue this,ep046
855,would be perfect I like this a lot,ep046
858,the dogs would love this I like to,ep046
861,elevate a deck and how it just flows,ep046
864,into the backyard it is pretty awesome,ep046
867,like that back inside they head upstairs,ep046
870,to see two spare bedrooms that share a,ep046
873,jack-and-jill bathroom it's really nice,ep046
876,I think our guests wouldn't want to,ep046
879,leave why do you see the master Wow I,ep046
882,love these double doors here this was,ep046
885,really nice,ep046
888,the master suite is huge it's so big and,ep046
891,I could just see us having like a,ep046
894,sitting area and it being a really,ep046
897,really nice space ooh I love a big,ep046
900,closet yeah you can fit a bed in here,ep046
903,and this bathroom is almost as big as,ep046
906,this closet yo you're not gonna believe,ep046
909,it love the double doors oh man shower,ep046
912,oh I love having the dual sinks and that,ep046
915,huge shower I can see where we just,ep046
918,would not be stepping on each other's,ep046
921,toes and really have a lot of room there,ep046
924,so let's go out here and take a look at,ep046
927,the balcony right off of the master,ep046
930,bedroom oh that's a cool little spot,ep046
933,it's really cute yeah it's in my spot,ep046
936,the beach when you have a nice breeze,ep046
939,[Music],ep046
942,tell me what you guys are thinking about,ep046
945,it well it's definitely not the,ep046
948,Victorian that I was looking for but I,ep046
951,actually really like it we would be able,ep046
954,to just move right in which is really,ep046
957,nice but it's not that blank canvas,ep046
960,dandy canvas that I wanted it might be,ep046
963,too much house for just us to but I,ep046
966,definitely love the backdoor deck and,ep046
969,the backyard is really negative I know,ep046
972,it's pretty far from the beach though,ep046
975,it's not fun loading a boards and,ep046
978,driving 30 minutes yeah aiming for the,ep046
981,middle ground I think this might be a,ep046
984,compromise,ep046
987,Caryn's hit the mark for Amanda I,ep046
990,absolutely love it,ep046
993,[Music],ep046
996,oh wow,ep046
999,Jose and Amanda want to escape their,ep046
1002,small apartment for more room in,ep046
1005,Jacksonville Beach Florida,ep046
1008,surfer Luka houses kind of hard when,ep046
1011,it's such a beautiful day working with a,ep046
1014,two hundred and thirty thousand dollar,ep046
1017,budget they've seen a fixer-upper beach,ep046
1020,bungalow with the location of Jose's,ep046
1023,dreams and the renovation of Amanda's,ep046
1026,nightmares then they saw a spacious 2,ep046
1029,story craftsman that wowed Amanda with,ep046
1032,room to grow into but Jose wasn't sure,ep046
1035,he could live so far from the SIRT in,ep046
1038,the sand so now their agents taking them,ep046
1041,to a place 20 minutes from the beach but,ep046
1044,she thinks could be the perfect,ep046
1047,compromise property since that bungalow,ep046
1050,small cozy feeling that I've been,ep046
1053,looking for I absolutely love it so cute,ep046
1056,I love the front door and all the,ep046
1059,flowers the only thing is it's pretty,ep046
1062,far from the beach it is far from the,ep046
1065,beach can't bike it well twenty minutes,ep046
1068,is a big difference from walking to the,ep046
1071,dish it is this is a two-bedroom,ep046
1074,one-bath a little bit over a thousand,ep046
1077,square feet it has been rehabbed so it,ep046
1080,is move-in ready,ep046
1083,and it comes with a garage the garage is,ep046
1086,a huge plus but the one bathroom is a,ep046
1089,big issue we were definitely needing it,ep046
1092,to - I know but the price is 2:19 right,ep046
1095,now that's good let's go take a look,ep046
1098,wow I love this little entryway is so,ep046
1101,nice Oh,ep046
1104,floors these original hardwood floors,ep046
1107,Wow,ep046
1110,this is really nice pretty nice it's not,ep046
1113,quite the open floor plan that you guys,ep046
1116,were looking for but it does open up,ep046
1119,into the dining area the only thing I,ep046
1122,don't like is Ali's defined spaces kind,ep046
1125,of make me feel cramped I don't like to,ep046
1128,feel cramped at all so let's go take a,ep046
1131,look at the kitchen my way I'm not too,ep046
1134,excited with the white cabinets but I do,ep046
1137,like the dark countertops and the dark,ep046
1140,appliances contrast I absolutely love,ep046
1143,the kitchen,ep046
1146,those white cabinets are exactly what I,ep046
1149,was looking for I'm not a huge fan of,ep046
1152,the dark countertops I definitely would,ep046
1155,have wanted something a little bit more,ep046
1158,light and airy this goes into your,ep046
1161,garage Oh Oh Raj who you put all our,ep046
1164,tools all our surfboards and paddle,ep046
1167,boards this be a great space right yes,ep046
1170,and this Punk's out to this gorgeous,ep046
1173,backyard so you got a cute little deck,ep046
1176,here and we're entertaining a little bit,ep046
1179,smaller than what I expected and then,ep046
1182,you've got a really good-sized backyard,ep046
1185,out here I think I wanted a little bit,ep046
1188,more of that green lawn and have a,ep046
1191,little bit more grass than what's here,ep046
1194,back inside they see the spare bedroom,ep046
1197,and the only bathroom actually almost,ep046
1200,the same size all right so come on over,ep046
1203,here let's take a look at this huge,ep046
1206,master I really like this side to do,ep046
1209,such room a lot of light comes in,ep046
1212,absolutely if a closets gonna sell a,ep046
1215,house this one's probably gonna come,ep046
1218,close we come in here and take a look at,ep046
1221,it was happy free big yeah Oh for me,ep046
1224,what really sold that room is that,ep046
1227,closet the closet is huge I mean it,ep046
1230,would be a dream closet,ep046
1233,so you've seen the house tell me what,ep046
1236,you guys think about it well it's,ep046
1239,definitely not the Victorian I was,ep046
1242,looking for but I do love you know that,ep046
1245,huge garage I know we were done I like,ep046
1248,it the bungalow style now the big con,ep046
1251,for me is how far it is from the beach,ep046
1254,you know it's not that far we're talking,ep046
1257,20 minutes if you have to get in your,ep046
1260,car it's too far I think we just need to,ep046
1263,weigh the pros and the cons and just,ep046
1266,kind of see what makes sense for us,ep046
1269,we'll talk it over that makes a lot of,ep046
1272,sense I'm here you need me because I,ep046
1275,just let me know if you guys have any,ep046
1278,questions cool thank you,ep046
1281,now was an Amanda have to decide what's,ep046
1284,most important a beachside location a,ep046
1287,move-in-ready home or extra storage,ep046
1290,space we really need to make a decision,ep046
1293,[Music],ep046
1296,we really need to make a decision with a,ep046
1299,two hundred and thirty thousand dollar,ep046
1302,budget Jose and Amanda are eager for,ep046
1305,more space in their first home together,ep046
1308,we start with the each bunch of,ep046
1311,locations awesome that's exactly what we,ep046
1314,wanted the only thing is it needs so,ep046
1317,much work and it is already 2:25 the,ep046
1320,bathroom is just completely gutted and,ep046
1323,it's the only bathroom but it's the,ep046
1326,empty campus I mean we can make it our,ep046
1329,own but I do kind of love that it does,ep046
1332,have a little bit of character some,ep046
1335,history to it it's it's really cute we,ep046
1338,have the Craftsman at 250 a little bit,ep046
1341,more inland in Jacksonville it is over a,ep046
1344,budget but then we don't have to spend,ep046
1347,any money on renovating I love just how,ep046
1350,Airy and just big it feels in there but,ep046
1353,when we walked in it was a little bit,ep046
1356,just bland it just really was lacking,ep046
1359,that personality that I was looking for,ep046
1362,we're also a good 35 minute drive on the,ep046
1365,beach with no traffic if you have to,ep046
1368,drive to the beach the 219 renovated,ep046
1371,bungalow yeah I like the bungalow style,ep046
1374,the only thing is it is a 25-minute,ep046
1377,drive from the beach it is but it's also,ep046
1380,almost move-in ready and that garage I,ep046
1383,mean that was I love that garage but one,ep046
1386,thing I did hate it was those define,ep046
1389,spaces if you walk in you have a little,ep046
1392,room you walk five feet in and you have,ep046
1395,another room and one bathroom would be a,ep046
1398,bit of an issue for us so which one will,ep046
1401,they pick,ep046
1404,[Music],ep046
1407,so it just comes down to what are we,ep046
1410,willing to compromise think we can,ep046
1413,definitely eliminate one off the bat the,ep046
1416,renovated bungalow it's just too,ep046
1419,segmented for us the space is a way too,ep046
1422,defined I don't think that's the right,ep046
1425,house for a green so now we're down to,ep046
1428,Springfield and the beach bungalow I,ep046
1431,think we have a lot of space in,ep046
1434,Springfield opportunities to grow and,ep046
1437,it's move-in ready I think,ep046
1440,beach house is where it's at I mean we,ep046
1443,could change the front room next to the,ep046
1446,kitchen into a bathroom we could tear,ep046
1449,down that wall ice in the kitchen and,ep046
1452,I'll really open it up it will be a big,ep046
1455,project but we can totally take it on I,ep046
1458,do have to say that being six blocks,ep046
1461,from the beach sounds really nice I know,ep046
1464,so that it we're doing we chose the,ep046
1467,beach bungalow primarily because we're,ep046
1470,six blocks from the beach everything,ep046
1473,that we do all of our friends is here on,ep046
1476,the beach it is nice having the beaches,ep046
1479,your backyard and you're gonna be able,ep046
1482,to relax very relaxing the list price of,ep046
1485,this house was 225 and we instead of,ep046
1488,getting it for 218 so we closed on the,ep046
1491,house two weeks ago and we already,ep046
1494,started renovations this is where the,ep046
1497,second bathroom is gonna be the house,ep046
1500,will be ready maybe two to three weeks,ep046
1503,and that's when we move in we put the,ep046
1506,vinyl flooring in so we started over in,ep046
1509,the bedrooms and we just worked all the,ep046
1512,way through the living room we also,ep046
1515,started redoing the master bedroom we,ep046
1518,opened up a hole in this wall and gave,ep046
1521,us access to the bathroom so now we have,ep046
1524,a master bathroom I'm actually doing a,ep046
1527,lot better than I thought with the,ep046
1530,renovation,ep046
1533,look at that see it don't you like doing,ep046
1536,it yourself I do this is fun,ep046
1539,well the dogs will live here but every,ep046
1542,time you bring them by they are loving,ep046
1545,it,ep046
1548,he found a lizard we definitely realized,ep046
1551,that eventually we're gonna kind of,ep046
1554,outgrow the space and we're probably,ep046
1557,gonna need something a little bit bigger,ep046
1560,but I think for now there is a lot of,ep046
1563,opportunities to make it our own we can,ep046
1566,just customize things and that I'm,ep046
1569,really happy about I really feel like we,ep046
1572,made the right choice,ep046
1575,[Music],ep046
12,amazing okay and we live in this,ep047
15,neighborhood please Brook is bringing,ep047
18,her family back to her beloved parents,ep047
21,ever since I have known Brook she's,ep047
24,always loved friends they sold,ep047
27,everything they had and set off to find,ep047
30,their perfect Parisian apartment,ep047
33,I love Parisian charm all details every,ep047
36,client I have once,ep047
39,French charm I love the idea of having,ep047
42,French charm but I don't need it it,ep047
45,looks like movie xiv bed actually that's,ep047
48,18th century beings the apartment comes,ep047
51,modern with clean lines I'm happy well,ep047
54,what's wrong with Claire it's old it's,ep047
57,just,ep047
60,[Music],ep047
63,I came to France for the very first time,ep047
66,when I was 17 years old didn't show up,ep047
69,or not sure sure sure,ep047
72,definitely just after college I was,ep047
75,determined to move to Paris and she did,ep047
78,I'm from California and he's from New,ep047
81,York Jonas was living in California and,ep047
84,I happened to be working with Brookes,ep047
87,best friend Amity and she showed me a,ep047
90,picture of a breath and said I think you,ep047
93,two would hit it up but she lives in,ep047
96,Paris and I thought well that's not,ep047
99,gonna work well welcome to Paris thank,ep047
102,you,ep047
105,so when Brooke was home for her summer,ep047
108,holiday I invited her to a 4th of July,ep047
111,barbecue at my house and we ended up so,ep047
114,Brooke moved back to the States,ep047
117,now we have two boys I think we were,ep047
120,really missing city life and we felt,ep047
123,like it would be a good time to have a,ep047
126,new adventure they had recently started,ep047
129,their own company and working from home,ep047
132,it suddenly struck them we thought well,ep047
135,we can work from anywhere why not choose,ep047
138,somewhere where we really really love,ep047
141,and because I took her away 15 years ago,ep047
144,from Paris it was an obvious choice for,ep047
147,us to try to get back to live here the,ep047
150,time is right for us to move now our,ep047
153,boys are still young enough to go on an,ep047
156,adventure so if we're not gonna do it,ep047
159,now then we're never gonna do it,ep047
162,Wow how does one describe Paris in 25,ep047
165,words or less,ep047
168,Paris is full of life and a lot of,ep047
171,energy there's a lot of movement so many,ep047
174,different people,ep047
177,I think the architecture sort of sets,ep047
180,the stage in the city so you already,ep047
183,have this beautiful backdrop and then to,ep047
186,add all the different types of people,ep047
189,and street artists and musicians you,ep047
192,can't go down a street in Paris and not,ep047
195,sort of feel inspired or re-energized,ep047
198,about life because there's so much going,ep047
201,on and it's so beautiful and let's not,ep047
204,forget the food we're looking for a,ep047
207,2-bedroom apartment and we'd love to be,ep047
210,in the Marais if possible I lived in,ep047
213,Paris many years ago and to me that,ep047
216,place is the most beautiful and,ep047
219,inspiring do you care whether it's old,ep047
222,or new or for me the older the better I,ep047
225,love her Asian charm old details well I,ep047
228,agree with Brooke on the charm I would,ep047
231,love it to have modern appliances and,ep047
234,modern amenities we have two boys they,ep047
237,are rambunctious and very active so I,ep047
240,would love the two-bedroom to be as,ep047
243,large as possible I would love enough,ep047
246,space to have a home office you're,ep047
249,working from home yes I work from home,ep047
252,what's your budget hmm well I think we'd,ep047
255,"like to stay around $2,600 okay I'm",ep047
258,gonna really try to show them properties,ep047
261,in the Mara but I have one I'm thinking,ep047
264,is even better and that's where Adrian,ep047
267,begins the house hunt on an island in a,ep047
270,mid,ep047
273,of the same distance the Ile de la Cite,ep047
276,a and of course you're not in the Marais,ep047
279,but the Mara is really right there you,ep047
282,can see it from here so you're in the,ep047
285,heart of the city I mean this is where,ep047
288,life began in Paris Wow doesn't get more,ep047
291,historic than this it's a two-bedroom,ep047
294,apartment in this building and it's on,ep047
297,courtyard so you're not gonna hear the,ep047
300,noise of this tree this has got to be,ep047
303,way over budget no it's right on budget,ep047
306,"it's $2,600 a month yes okay come on in",ep047
309,those wood beams,ep047
312,that's look old that's 18th century,ep047
315,beings things like this I love I love,ep047
318,chandeliers I love decorative details,ep047
321,and now you've got a nice big dining,ep047
324,space mm-hmm and then you've got a full,ep047
327,kitchen and a fairly big fridge the,ep047
330,kitchen is pretty small don't forget it,ep047
333,kind of makes reverse El in a way,ep047
336,Hey,ep047
339,something about it doesn't mesh with the,ep047
342,rest of the apartment okay so and you,ep047
345,know a pretty good-sized living room,ep047
348,yeah we could fit here we could put the,ep047
351,boys on our laps for me,ep047
354,the French charm the style of kind of,ep047
357,old Paris isn't as important to me as,ep047
360,finding a comfortable apartment because,ep047
363,we have Paris all around us and then one,ep047
366,of the bedrooms is here oh wow oh wow,ep047
369,yeah so here you've got a second bedroom,ep047
372,and I actually think that in this,ep047
375,apartment it would be better to put the,ep047
378,boys in the master bedroom yeah,ep047
381,well the boys have taken out over most,ep047
384,of our lives so to me it's really,ep047
387,one-and-a-half bedrooms because that,ep047
390,second bedroom is sort of an extension,ep047
393,of the living room so this master,ep047
396,bedroom is over here very nice another,ep047
399,chandelier for you so you know this bed,ep047
402,is really twins put together which means,ep047
405,that for the boys it could make sense so,ep047
408,what I haven't seen is a space to work,ep047
411,they think that at the entry table,ep047
414,that's a spot you could put a desk in,ep047
417,also there's the corner where the TV is,ep047
420,in the living room right right I love,ep047
423,the wooden beams I love the chandeliers,ep047
426,this place uses Parisian charm and I,ep047
429,particularly love the master bedroom it,ep047
432,has everything we asked for I still feel,ep047
435,that it's a little tight this seems like,ep047
438,we kind of bouncing off the walls a,ep047
441,little bit I keep going back to the,ep047
444,Marais I would say that this,ep047
447,neighborhood doesn't quite have the same,ep047
450,energy as,ep047
453,if they gave the illu ICT a chance i,ep047
456,think they'd ultimately love it even,ep047
459,more than the moiré really in the heart,ep047
462,of the moiré whoa I love red it's a lot,ep047
465,of red actually I still don't see room,ep047
468,for a desk or even a dining room table,ep047
471,and what's wrong with America it's old,ep047
474,chair it's just,ep047
477,[Music],ep047
480,guys look this is a magic place Brooke,ep047
483,has longed to return to Paris since,ep047
486,living here 15 years ago I moved here,ep047
489,and I fell in love with the city and now,ep047
492,she's done it this time with a husband,ep047
495,and two young boys it was always just a,ep047
498,dream because it seemed like such a far,ep047
501,off goal these cards are jumping I think,ep047
504,it was our last trip that really planted,ep047
507,a seed for us because Jonas was working,ep047
510,remotely and we finally realized yeah,ep047
513,this could happen I mean I don't speak,ep047
516,French so I was a little bit intimidated,ep047
519,by the idea but because Brooke had lived,ep047
522,here before and because she knows the,ep047
525,language so well I felt comfortable can,ep047
528,I check the biggest challenge may be,ep047
531,quickly agreeing on and nabbing a place,ep047
534,in this fast-moving market a willing to,ep047
537,sacrifice a lot of things to get into a,ep047
540,place sooner for me that's more of a,ep047
543,priority than getting the perfect,ep047
546,environment that puts house one in play,ep047
549,it's on budget and it has everything we,ep047
552,asked for I still feel that it's a,ep047
555,little tight I would say that this,ep047
558,neighborhood doesn't quite have the same,ep047
561,energy as the Marais,ep047
564,Mahe means swamp and Fitz it's maze of,ep047
567,narrow streets Adrien walks them,ep047
570,straight into it for house 2 you're,ep047
573,really in the heart of the Marais and,ep047
576,this is a treasure of a street this is,ep047
579,the Rue du trésor meaning treasure,ep047
582,it's unbelievable isn't it beautiful the,ep047
585,apartment is right here on the first,ep047
588,floor this beautiful building it's two,ep047
591,bedrooms it has a big modern kitchen,ep047
594,with a big refrigerator and best of all,ep047
597,"it's right on your budget at $2,600 a",ep047
600,month so I think this street would be,ep047
603,great for the kids because it's there's,ep047
606,no cars exactly perfil decide for them,ep047
609,so let's go out okay I was surprised to,ep047
612,find a cul-de-sac in Paris all right,ep047
615,whoa this I love red that's a lot of red,ep047
618,actually Plus look Jonas look at the,ep047
621,size of that refrigerator I noticed a,ep047
624,dishwasher too nice plus it's a full,ep047
627,oven and a four-burner stove and a,ep047
630,microwave lots of storage this that's,ep047
633,what we need I love this oh there's a,ep047
636,decorative fireplace and I really like,ep047
639,this mirror it makes the room feel more,ep047
642,open plus you've got a door directly,ep047
645,into the living room okay I see I see,ep047
648,okay the other ones a decent size but I,ep047
651,still don't see kind of room for a desk,ep047
654,or even a dining room table I suggest,ep047
657,maybe adding a dining room table in this,ep047
660,corner and over there would be a good,ep047
663,nook for a desk I love this decorative,ep047
666,fireplace again and the mirror yeah well,ep047
669,what's wrong with the mirror looks like,ep047
672,it's a little dirty it's old it's just,ep047
675,old I love the idea of having French,ep047
678,charm but I don't need it and if the,ep047
681,apartment comes modern with clean lines,ep047
684,I'm happy so you see here's the second,ep047
687,bedroom that's just off the kitchen okay,ep047
690,yes it's a good-sized room for the boys,ep047
693,I am still a little concerned about the,ep047
696,bed I really wish we had twin beds maybe,ep047
699,the landlord would be willing to change,ep047
702,it out right now I'm feeling a lot of,ep047
705,pressure to find a place and not only,ep047
708,find a place but find the right place I,ep047
711,think that in terms of decorative,ep047
714,details it's got it all for me,ep047
717,I like the kitchen in general I don't,ep047
720,know how we could have people over for,ep047
723,dinner and I think if I put a desk in,ep047
726,there and we put a dining room in there,ep047
729,I'm just afraid that there's not a lot,ep047
732,of play area for the boys both Brooke,ep047
735,and Jonas are concerned that the living,ep047
738,room is not large enough to handle a,ep047
741,living room a dining room and a desk and,ep047
744,it's missing that furniture so it means,ep047
747,they'd have to add it the next apartment,ep047
750,I show them is considerably larger and,ep047
753,has,ep047
756,a lot more space with a big dining room,ep047
759,table and space for an office two full,ep047
762,bedrooms and a big plus two full,ep047
765,bathrooms,ep047
768,[Laughter],ep047
771,[Music],ep047
774,when Brooke met Jonas it eventually,ep047
777,meant that she would have to leave her,ep047
780,beloved Paris move back to the states I,ep047
783,left Paris because Jonas didn't really,ep047
786,have an opportunity to work here USA he,ep047
789,wasn't able to get working papers he,ep047
792,didn't speak French so her love for,ep047
795,Jonas took her away from Paris so I was,ep047
798,hoping that maybe one day I could make,ep047
801,it happen again,ep047
804,but now he's bringing her back out of,ep047
807,his love we just really want an,ep047
810,adventure and it's hard not to have an,ep047
813,adventure in Paris having started their,ep047
816,own company all they need now is to find,ep047
819,a place to live my top priority is space,ep047
822,house one doesn't provide that for Jonas,ep047
825,we could fit here together,ep047
828,but it's right up Brookes alley I love,ep047
831,the wooden beams I love the chandeliers,ep047
834,this place of oozes Parisian charm and I,ep047
837,particularly love the master bedroom I,ep047
840,think Brookes number one priority is,ep047
843,location house 2 hits that on the nose,ep047
846,for Brooke you're really in the heart of,ep047
849,the Marais I think this street would be,ep047
852,great for the kids because it's a,ep047
855,cul-de-sac oldest ass but still has its,ep047
858,space challenges for Jonas I still don't,ep047
861,see room for a desk or even a dining,ep047
864,room table that difference could make,ep047
867,house 3 a topic of hot debate as Adrian,ep047
870,moves away from Center to deliver enough,ep047
873,space for Jonas so right now we're on,ep047
876,Rue de fée Ducal there okay this is the,ep047
879,northern moiré it's a little more,ep047
882,residential because it's not as touristy,ep047
885,and it's in this building right here so,ep047
888,how many bedrooms two bedrooms but it,ep047
891,has two bathrooms in our budget it's a,ep047
894,little over your budget at 2750 per,ep047
897,month,ep047
900,it's not to much over we'll have to see,ep047
903,so come on in opulence that's just good,ep047
906,word for it I mean look at the gold,ep047
909,detail on the fireplace incredible this,ep047
912,is stunning oh and let's talk about this,ep047
915,part table c8 Thanksgiving dinner no,ep047
918,problem well I'm seeing a lot of,ep047
921,beautiful things and we have some little,ep047
924,hands that would like to touch all these,ep047
927,beautiful things just makes me a little,ep047
930,nervous this place is unbelievable it,ep047
933,has so many of those details that catch,ep047
936,my eye,ep047
939,this kitchen is beautiful I know I asked,ep047
942,for modern appliances but this is the,ep047
945,best of both worlds it's got French,ep047
948,character and it looks like it's pretty,ep047
951,new it's all new the only caveat is that,ep047
954,the fruit little French that is Wow,ep047
957,but you know we shop here every day not,ep047
960,every week this is the only detail,ep047
963,that's missing so come see the master,ep047
966,bedroom,ep047
969,all right when we first arrived I was,ep047
972,thinking that Jonah's would be,ep047
975,overwhelmed by the opulence of this,ep047
978,place but in fact he actually,ep047
981,appreciates it and enjoys it so that,ep047
984,makes me happy okay there are no words,ep047
987,I'm kind of speechless yeah it looks,ep047
990,like Louie the fourteenth bed actually,ep047
993,Jonas look that's a desk that is great,ep047
996,yeah you got your home office yeah,ep047
999,problem is I'm afraid if I'm doing a,ep047
1002,video chat my clients might see this bed,ep047
1005,and think they'd make me pay me a little,ep047
1008,too much and it's a second bedroom yeah,ep047
1011,it has two beds that's what we asked for,ep047
1014,and did you notice turnaround yeah a,ep047
1017,shower in the boys room wait what yeah,ep047
1020,there's also I think here you see you're,ep047
1023,making it sound like this is a good,ep047
1026,thing I'm just not sure about them,ep047
1029,opening and closing and a running into,ep047
1032,it although it is two bathrooms it's a,ep047
1035,very strange two bathrooms,ep047
1038,yeah I'm not thrilled about the shower I,ep047
1041,don't want anything to happen apartment,ep047
1044,has a desk in the bedroom so I can shut,ep047
1047,the door and have the privacy I need to,ep047
1050,do work I love the kitchen,ep047
1053,the only problem though is that fridge,ep047
1056,is really small the kids rooms I'm not,ep047
1059,so thrilled with it's just not a,ep047
1062,child-friendly room this apartment might,ep047
1065,be the best compromise until you factor,ep047
1068,in our kids and I have no idea what,ep047
1071,they're gonna do to this place you,ep047
1074,really need to make a decision very,ep047
1077,quickly because these apartments will,ep047
1080,not stay on the market long I have no,ep047
1083,idea which apartment I want I know,ep047
1086,you're concerned with all the statues,ep047
1089,and decorations but I think we can get,ep047
1092,rid of those and make it a little more,ep047
1095,child-friendly that thing we cannot,ep047
1098,change is that shower and the sink in,ep047
1101,the boys room what's wrong with that I,ep047
1104,mean have you been,ep047
1107,I know you don't like making quick,ep047
1110,decisions but we do have a few hours to,ep047
1113,make the decision after moving the,ep047
1116,family all the way from California to,ep047
1119,Paris,ep047
1122,with the freedom of having their own,ep047
1125,business Brooke and Jonas must figure,ep047
1128,out which apartment they're going to,ep047
1131,live and work in matching that French,ep047
1134,charm with the conveniences of modern,ep047
1137,appliances and space for our kids that's,ep047
1140,gonna be tricky,ep047
1143,house one on the eve the last day is on,ep047
1146,"budget $2,600 mud Wow",ep047
1149,right on the send and has a lot of,ep047
1152,Parisian charm beans I actually thought,ep047
1155,the entire apartment was beautiful,ep047
1158,except for the kitchen yeah the second,ep047
1161,bedroom to me wasn't really a second,ep047
1164,bedroom it was an extension of the,ep047
1167,living room there just wouldn't be,ep047
1170,comfortable it's being a comfortable,ep047
1173,filling room we didn't really have a lot,ep047
1176,of space to sit around on her lap I,ep047
1179,don't know how that's gonna work how,ep047
1182,about that Ruby trays are with the,ep047
1185,cul-de-sac I couldn't believe that there,ep047
1188,was an apartment in our price range on a,ep047
1191,pedestrian street with no traffic in the,ep047
1194,heart of the moiré that one was nice,ep047
1197,there's a decorative fireplace I love,ep047
1200,this it made me a little sad that there,ep047
1203,wasn't an actual dining room there who,ep047
1206,ever wanted to have people over that,ep047
1209,would be a problem house three in the,ep047
1212,upper money as a certain Genesee club,ep047
1215,what was the word you used popular not,ep047
1218,only was it bigger that was a great,ep047
1221,dining room for a party the living room,ep047
1224,was large and it had a workspace for me,ep047
1227,in the bedroom a desk which none of the,ep047
1230,other places had in that kitchen I,ep047
1233,really loved it but then she opened the,ep047
1236,fridge deflated,ep047
1239,[Music],ep047
1242,I would eliminate the one right near the,ep047
1245,Sun on the other less you'd say I think,ep047
1248,I'm in agreement with you I couldn't get,ep047
1251,over the size it didn't feel like a true,ep047
1254,two-bedroom I feel like we were getting,ep047
1257,one and a half bedrooms I know you said,ep047
1260,that you had one in mind already I,ep047
1263,thought that the best place for us was,ep047
1266,the northern moiré because it was so,ep047
1269,big the second bedroom for the boys has,ep047
1272,two separate beds which is what we,ep047
1275,wanted I know you're concerned with all,ep047
1278,the statues and decorations but I think,ep047
1281,we can get rid of those and make it a,ep047
1284,little more child-friendly the thing we,ep047
1287,cannot change is that shower and the,ep047
1290,sink in the boys room what's wrong with,ep047
1293,that I mean have you been so what did,ep047
1296,you like about the Buddha trades or I,ep047
1299,really just felt like it was kind of the,ep047
1302,best of both worlds with all the nice,ep047
1305,Parisian decorative details and charm,ep047
1308,but then also a really awesome kitchen,ep047
1311,our own bedrooms doors closing it seemed,ep047
1314,like a good layout for us and I know how,ep047
1317,much you wanted a home office but it,ep047
1320,might make more sense to try to find a,ep047
1323,workspace somewhere else they'd already,ep047
1326,be saving money on rent every month so,ep047
1329,maybe we could use some of that money,ep047
1332,towards finding an office space for you,ep047
1335,I think I'm coming around a little bit,ep047
1338,to saying that maybe that's better for,ep047
1341,the family yeah I think I would pick the,ep047
1344,British phrase or I would - awesome,ep047
1347,[Music],ep047
1350,I still can't believe we're here which,ep047
1353,one you want rocky our kids fell in love,ep047
1356,with friends because they equate it with,ep047
1359,pastries I got all different flavors,ep047
1362,they think that French people holy,ep047
1365,desserts if we can get five more,ep047
1368,interviews I think we'll be good this,ep047
1371,week when we moved into this apartment I,ep047
1374,didn't know where I was gonna work where,ep047
1377,I would have a workspace but it turns,ep047
1380,out right down the street is a cafe they,ep047
1383,have great Wi-Fi I would actually move,ep047
1386,this sentence it's time for Brooke to,ep047
1389,come help me she comes and we work,ep047
1392,together the street outside was one of,ep047
1395,the biggest selling points and it's,ep047
1398,lived up to every expectation I would,ep047
1401,just say hearing Brookes make French,ep047
1404,every day has really really ignited our,ep047
1407,relationship,ep047
1410,[Music],ep047
1413,[Laughter],ep047
12,[Music],ep048
15,this is for your backyard Tim and,ep048
18,kseniya are looking for a vacation home,ep048
21,in Destin Florida but they have,ep048
24,different visions of what the home,ep048
27,should be what I'm really looking for is,ep048
30,nice a single-family home a nice,ep048
33,backyard at least this house has a pool,ep048
36,this doesn't scream tropical paradise,ep048
39,right now to me but for her it's all,ep048
42,about the views we work real hard I see,ep048
45,it it's just yep right there Ksenia see,ep048
48,that the peekaboo ocean view that's not,ep048
51,what I wanted she wants to be right on,ep048
54,the water with the beach at her doorstep,ep048
57,yes that's what I want to see out of my,ep048
60,window will Tim be convinced I mean,ep048
63,there's only so much beach to buy,ep048
66,thinking this could really work I guess,ep048
69,I'm the only holdout,ep048
72,[Music],ep048
75,they making food they make him tell Nene,ep048
78,my name is Tim I'm 43 years old I'm an,ep048
81,investor and I do internet marketing,ep048
84,my name is Ksenia I'm 30 years old I'm,ep048
87,stay-at-home mom we have our two,ep048
90,children Sophia she's eight years old,ep048
93,and Michael he's just turned one and we,ep048
96,have a mother-in-law that lives with us,ep048
99,and a father-in-law sometimes a grandma,ep048
102,Seba Lucy to help Jimmy,ep048
105,we met 11 years ago in Russia,ep048
108,Novosibirsk I was doing business in,ep048
111,Russia and met her on a blind date and,ep048
114,it's been a bliss ever since tim is a,ep048
117,greatest man unbelievable father and a,ep048
120,great husband he has an interesting,ep048
123,combination of very cautious yet very,ep048
126,adventurous,ep048
129,Kirstin he was incredible she's easy to,ep048
132,be around and she's very good at getting,ep048
135,what she wants she zeroes in on what she,ep048
138,wants then she's gonna really fight hard,ep048
141,for it,ep048
144,and she's perfect since Jim's job allows,ep048
147,them to be mobile they split their time,ep048
150,between their various properties,ep048
153,including a place in Colorado where Tim,ep048
156,is from and a house down in Nicaragua,ep048
159,but when they really want to take a,ep048
162,break they had here to Destin a Florida,ep048
165,resort town they discovered when their,ep048
168,daughter was a baby they put her on the,ep048
171,sand and took a picture and sent it to,ep048
174,my mom and my mom was furious as me she,ep048
177,said why do you put baby on the snow but,ep048
180,that just describes how beautiful the,ep048
183,sand is here it's pure powder white it,ep048
186,looks just like snow we love the beach,ep048
189,we love the weather we love the southern,ep048
192,hospitality and we just always wanted to,ep048
195,spend at least part of the year in this,ep048
198,area he's born to play in the sand oh my,ep048
201,goodness now they just like to upgrade,ep048
204,from their condo to a larger place I,ep048
207,don't like sharing a well with a,ep048
210,neighbor I like to take my kids out to,ep048
213,the backyard to play I want to feel more,ep048
216,comfortable when I come here I want to,ep048
219,spend time and enjoy it,ep048
222,so they're on the hunt they just have to,ep048
225,decide what makes sense price-wise for,ep048
228,the home which they also hope to run out,ep048
231,when they're not using it we totally,ep048
234,disagree on the budget my budgets 1.2,ep048
237,million I'm happy anywhere within that,ep048
240,range as long as we can make some of,ep048
243,that money back on rental and if it,ep048
246,makes sense and if I can have a nicer,ep048
249,house for the kids then I'll spend the,ep048
252,money to get that I prefer to spend less,ep048
255,money and if house needs renovations,ep048
258,that's fine with me that's something I,ep048
261,do with my dad we remodeled quite a few,ep048
264,homes before I would prefer to have it,ep048
267,move-in ready but there's money to be,ep048
270,made by fixing it up I can see that too,ep048
273,are there any Mediterranean sell homes,ep048
276,in this neighborhood or is it almost,ep048
279,like a beach cottage style or no I mean,ep048
282,there's a good mix up and of course,ep048
285,beach cottage is probably your number,ep048
288,one look the style for our home here is,ep048
291,gonna be totally different than the,ep048
294,Nicaragua house to Nicaragua house is,ep048
297,modern we're looking for more of a beach,ep048
300,house more of a Mediterranean style,ep048
303,house something beachy and light would,ep048
306,be nice I would like it for it to be,ep048
309,five or six bedrooms because first of,ep048
312,all fits our family better and second it,ep048
315,that fifth or sixth bedroom here means a,ep048
318,lot more on rental return I don't think,ep048
321,we need a huge house I would rather have,ep048
324,something small cozy what do you mean by,ep048
327,small like four bedrooms or yeah smaller,ep048
330,four bedroom how far away away from the,ep048
333,beach I mean really only about a block,ep048
336,this feels like a long walk I wanted to,ep048
339,be on the beach I want to open my,ep048
342,balcony door and have my morning cup of,ep048
345,tea and watch my kids build sandcastles,ep048
348,sounds like Nicaragua we own it if we,ep048
351,get something on a beach it's gonna have,ep048
354,to be a townhouse because of a house on,ep048
357,the beach and Dustin cost three or five,ep048
360,million dollars I don't mind living in,ep048
363,townhome I want to have more space than,ep048
366,a townhome and I'm tired of sharing a,ep048
369,wall with the neighbor how big are the,ep048
372,backyards for these homes most of the,ep048
375,Lots around 50 about 150 d tim also,ep048
378,wants a large backyard with a pool and,ep048
381,tall ceilings Ksenia is focused on the,ep048
384,kitchen I would prefer to have white,ep048
387,kitchen something beachy big dining,ep048
390,table to hold every family member that,ep048
393,might want to come yes very important,ep048
396,Emily's very,ep048
399,I'll toast to that to the house,ep048
402,and I just drank some tequila first up,ep048
405,is a cape cod-style three blocks from,ep048
408,the beach I don't like the fact that,ep048
411,it's not a Mediterranean and it's not,ep048
414,townhouse on the beach I knew I took a,ep048
417,chance on bringing them to this home but,ep048
420,the market taught here in Destin now,ep048
423,there's not a lot of inventory things,ep048
426,are not staying on the market long at,ep048
429,all,ep048
432,I mean sometimes days maybe weeks we're,ep048
435,not on the beach huh we're not on the,ep048
438,beach but price is $7.99 way into my,ep048
441,budget yeah now it's three bedroom three,ep048
444,and a half bath but there's lots of,ep048
447,potential for extra bedrooms here okay,ep048
450,now house Islands,ep048
453,I love the tall ceilings I do like the,ep048
456,size now this is not actually one of the,ep048
459,bedrooms here but it can be this wall,ep048
462,here can be opened up into it this,ep048
465,closet and that car you can make this,ep048
468,already a fourth bedroom which would be,ep048
471,good from rental and if I want to keep,ep048
474,it as an office we can do that too and,ep048
477,there's another bedroom right here,ep048
480,across the hall oh I like the double,ep048
483,doors and the living rooms right here to,ep048
486,your left,ep048
489,oh wow I'd love this living room does it,ep048
492,come furnished it does this is a really,ep048
495,nice home but not exactly what I was,ep048
498,looking for the furnishings are little,ep048
501,too traditional and it will require work,ep048
504,and quite a bit of work to get it where,ep048
507,I want it to be it's not very beachy now,ep048
510,but with a little bit of work I think we,ep048
513,can make it nice I think the layout is,ep048
516,really nice is this the only dining,ep048
519,table it is wow man this isn't even big,ep048
522,enough for a family much less if we,ep048
525,decide to rent the place well I mean,ep048
528,it's nice cuz it's open to this very,ep048
531,large kitchen here this is nice cabinets,ep048
534,but I was hoping for something lighter,ep048
537,for the beach house I mean we paint the,ep048
540,cabinet's easily I like the fact that a,ep048
543,stainless steel appliances appliance is,ep048
546,a nice let's take a look at the master,ep048
549,bedroom okay this is a great-sized room,ep048
552,what do you think about the furnishings,ep048
555,looks a little bulky a little too big,ep048
558,for the room and it doesn't look very,ep048
561,beachy but you know you could easily,ep048
564,change out the comforter or maybe some,ep048
567,pillows or make it a lot feature look at,ep048
570,that's a nice big room it's a good,ep048
573,master,ep048
576,you've got jetted tub the tub looks a,ep048
579,little old well so does the shower and,ep048
582,so does the pain but this is some stuff,ep048
585,that you'd add context this double,ep048
588,vanity,ep048
591,yeah it's a dual identity at least,ep048
594,you've got the tall cabinets which is,ep048
597,great nice sounds master bath again with,ep048
600,some work it's gonna be great I do like,ep048
603,the fact that there's a nice long,ep048
606,driveway it's good for us and the fact,ep048
609,that renters can park as many cars as,ep048
612,they want but you're not gonna have pool,ep048
615,I think we can make it work all of this,ep048
618,driveway space you probably could cut,ep048
621,off some but it could be done to make,ep048
624,this house work I obviously need to put,ep048
627,a pool in the dust within my budget for,ep048
630,the most part I really like the feel of,ep048
633,this house back inside they head,ep048
636,upstairs to see the remaining bedroom,ep048
639,spaces this actually used to be two,ep048
642,bedrooms and they actually opened it up,ep048
645,to one so it could easily be back two,ep048
648,bedroom yeah we know we can switch it,ep048
651,back if we need to this is a nice,ep048
654,upstairs I have a surprise for y'all oh,ep048
657,look around when I saw the potential in,ep048
660,extra space upstairs to let my,ep048
663,creativity shine I got a little excited,ep048
666,I see insulation I see sawdust and a lot,ep048
669,of work the house had to start from,ep048
672,insulation in sawdust okay if we think,ep048
675,we need more space at least we have an,ep048
678,option yeah yeah there was a challenge,ep048
681,to me because it doesn't have a pool my,ep048
684,family does really need a pool but when,ep048
687,I walked up to the house the curb appeal,ep048
690,was nice it wasn't the Mediterranean,ep048
693,house that I was looking for but it,ep048
696,looked good to me so when I walked in,ep048
699,the door I was really happy and it felt,ep048
702,like home I really liked the idea of,ep048
705,working upstairs and creating our own,ep048
708,space and the price is right but the,ep048
711,location is just not working for me you,ep048
714,know where my heart is,ep048
717,I really want to see something on the,ep048
720,beach hearts at the beach,ep048
723,so Destin arranges for her colleague to,ep048
726,line up an oceanfront property for them,ep048
729,to see that's the price it's a million,ep048
732,195 that's the cost we lived at the,ep048
735,beach Taman Ksenia are on the hunt for a,ep048
738,big vacation home for their extended,ep048
741,family in Destin Florida working with a,ep048
744,budget of up to 1.2 million they've seen,ep048
747,a 3-bedroom Cape Cod at a low price they,ep048
750,liked that there was plenty of space to,ep048
753,add bedrooms and Tim thought they could,ep048
756,even squeeze in a pool but it just,ep048
759,wasn't close enough to the beach for,ep048
762,Ksenia so today they're meeting their,ep048
765,agent scoler at a property that should,ep048
768,appeal to Ksenia so I'm guessing this is,ep048
771,on the water you're right it sure is I'm,ep048
774,excited this is not a townhome or a,ep048
777,detached single-family but it is a,ep048
780,low-density condo this is a penthouse,ep048
783,four bedrooms four baths the square,ep048
786,footage is 2180,ep048
789,so that's the price it's a million 195,ep048
792,"it was just reduced $200,000 that's in",ep048
795,my budget but that's a little low for,ep048
798,what I would like to spend that's the,ep048
801,cost of living at the beach let's see,ep048
804,the view let's go look at the view,ep048
807,[Music],ep048
810,okay we have two bedrooms and two baths,ep048
813,here okay I'm really excited to show you,ep048
816,why I brought you here oh that is,ep048
819,amazing I'm having goose bones just,ep048
822,looking at this why do you think it's,ep048
825,worth stretching your budget for this,ep048
828,Don I think I'm in trouble I think I may,ep048
831,agree with you on that okay I like the,ep048
834,double high ceiling I do like Ojai the,ep048
837,ceilings are done and I like the fact,ep048
840,that they're skylights there is a lot of,ep048
843,natural it's a very open room does it,ep048
846,come furnished it does come furnished,ep048
849,yet do you even want to keep this,ep048
852,furniture not really that's not really,ep048
855,my style,ep048
858,dining table it's nice and big it is a,ep048
861,nice time a dining table this Greg I,ep048
864,like the kitchen that's nice and big,ep048
867,cabinets a little dated huh yeah,ep048
870,the hardware's looks a little strange to,ep048
873,me do you like this kitchen I mean,ep048
876,overall I think I could live with it but,ep048
879,update maybe put a nice backsplash new,ep048
882,hardware we can make it work I mean the,ep048
885,key to this house since the price point,ep048
888,so high is to be able to change things,ep048
891,expensively is this something your dad,ep048
894,can do yes he can certainly no that's a,ep048
897,great idea,ep048
900,it'll look a lot better take you guys,ep048
903,into the master great views here look at,ep048
906,this you have a lot of people getting,ep048
909,wake up to this via Tim you know it,ep048
912,would be nice though in the master as if,ep048
915,it actually had a balcony the views nice,ep048
918,but it's nice to step out well the,ep048
921,balconies only a couple steps away,ep048
924,that's true the master bath has been,ep048
927,completely renovated oh wow this is nice,ep048
930,oh this is perfect,ep048
933,I like the fact there's two things it's,ep048
936,two sinks that's a plus and a shower,ep048
939,nice and big this is a nice master bath,ep048
942,it's beautiful huh I think it's great,ep048
945,they head upstairs to look in on the,ep048
948,last bedroom a loft space there's not a,ep048
951,lot of privacy for this venture now you,ep048
954,can talk your mom into believe the hair,ep048
957,go for it there's a lot of problems with,ep048
960,the house there's a problem with the,ep048
963,space and everything isn't perfect and,ep048
966,it should be for this price point I know,ep048
969,Tim wants a bigger house but I actually,ep048
972,prefer a smaller space it's easier to,ep048
975,maintain and yet big enough for our,ep048
978,family they head downstairs and outside,ep048
981,to the bill,ep048
984,beach access this will be your backyard,ep048
987,this is a perfect backyard for me,ep048
990,I'd like the view obviously I like the,ep048
993,master bedroom I like the high ceilings,ep048
996,but I mean what I'm really looking for,ep048
999,is a nice single-family home and more,ep048
1002,bedrooms a nice backyard but everything,ep048
1005,else is pretty much perfect in this,ep048
1008,condo isn't it,ep048
1011,with a little bit of work this kitchen,ep048
1014,will be perfect the dining room is big,ep048
1017,enough that you'll love the location I,ep048
1020,am nervous about the price but keep in,ep048
1023,mind you're paying for this yeah who,ep048
1026,doesn't what you're gonna pay a little,ep048
1029,more when you will have a higher return,ep048
1032,on your investment I mean there's only,ep048
1035,so much beach to buy,ep048
1038,well that's hard to argue with these,ep048
1041,views I think this could really work I,ep048
1044,guess I'm the only holdout because Tim's,ep048
1047,not sure they found the one they head,ep048
1050,out to see another option so this isn't,ep048
1053,a Mediterranean house this is a beach,ep048
1056,house I like it we're only missing the,ep048
1059,beach though I tried to find the best,ep048
1062,compromise house for them and I'm still,ep048
1065,not sure that this is gonna work,ep048
1068,[Music],ep048
1071,imagine if we had a backyard it could be,ep048
1074,doing a lot more than us enough with the,ep048
1077,fighting already can't we just decide,ep048
1080,Ksenia and husband Tim are eager to,ep048
1083,trade their small condo for a larger,ep048
1086,place here in Destin Florida with up to,ep048
1089,1.2 million to spend tim is targeting,ep048
1092,five to six bedrooms single-family,ep048
1095,houses a few blocks from the ocean but,ep048
1098,kseniya thinks living right on the water,ep048
1101,is crucial so far they've seen a,ep048
1104,single-family home about a five-minute,ep048
1107,walk from the water it had a low price,ep048
1110,and space to add all the bedrooms he,ep048
1113,wants then their agents colleague showed,ep048
1116,them a four-bedroom penthouse right on,ep048
1119,the beach and right at the top of their,ep048
1122,budget she was smitten,ep048
1125,but he wasn't sold now their agents,ep048
1128,lined up another option I don't see any,ep048
1131,sand Destin you're about a block from,ep048
1134,the beach you're not far at all here so,ep048
1137,this isn't a Mediterranean house this is,ep048
1140,a beach house I like it so what's the,ep048
1143,"price 835,000 we're only missing the",ep048
1146,beach though I tried to find the best,ep048
1149,compromise house for them and I'm still,ep048
1152,not sure that this is gonna work Wow,ep048
1155,it's a nice room,ep048
1158,I think the ceilings a little low if I,ep048
1161,can touch it you are enclosed what about,ep048
1164,these birds over here I don't know if I,ep048
1167,like the birds,ep048
1170,very neat I've never had them birds in,ep048
1173,our house before seems like a lot of,ep048
1176,work went into making them this is a big,ep048
1179,table does this come furnished with this,ep048
1182,partially furnished so will this table,ep048
1185,come with it yes,ep048
1188,it's a great table I love the size of,ep048
1191,this table this is a big kitchen dryness,ep048
1194,is nice what do you think of that think,ep048
1197,I hate this sinking can this thing be,ep048
1200,older than the house,ep048
1203,the light is a little dated but at least,ep048
1206,it's not dark kitchen I think we can get,ep048
1209,away with just putting a new backsplash,ep048
1212,and definitely the things got to go and,ep048
1215,that's something that your dad can do I,ep048
1218,think yes,ep048
1221,well that'll be fun then they head down,ep048
1224,the hall to see a first-floor guest room,ep048
1227,and bath then it's upstairs to the,ep048
1230,master suite it's missing the master,ep048
1233,you isn't it it is missing the golf for,ep048
1236,you but just a little bit of a peek you,ep048
1239,have a balcony something this is what a,ep048
1242,pic of your view is yes check it out I,ep048
1245,see it,ep048
1248,yep right there Ksenia see that peekaboo,ep048
1251,ocean view means I have to really search,ep048
1254,for it to find it and that's not what I,ep048
1257,wanted I wanted a full ocean view right,ep048
1260,outside of my window Wow don't wanna,ep048
1263,shower for you oh that's nice but it's a,ep048
1266,single vanity single sink there's enough,ep048
1269,room here though I think if we wanted to,ep048
1272,change that out we probably could they,ep048
1275,look in on another bedroom upstairs and,ep048
1278,bonus room before making their way to,ep048
1281,the back yard for a surprise,ep048
1284,look it's a clean slate if somebody,ep048
1287,choices of what to do here at least this,ep048
1290,house has a pool well sweetheart I told,ep048
1293,you I was gonna build Mikey a sandbox,ep048
1296,and it looks like Destin's already built,ep048
1299,it for us,ep048
1302,this is a lot of work that's a lot of,ep048
1305,work this doesn't scream tropical,ep048
1308,paradise right now to me Destin leads,ep048
1311,them to a guest suite with a separate,ep048
1314,entrance two bedrooms and two baths wow,ep048
1317,this is great I think the house has a,ep048
1320,great rental potential and it will fit a,ep048
1323,family very nicely there's a lot of big,ep048
1326,rooms upstairs I didn't like the young,ep048
1329,the ceilings are a little bit too low,ep048
1332,and as much as I give you our time about,ep048
1335,the backyard it doesn't give us the,ep048
1338,potential to to make it the way we want,ep048
1341,what I didn't like that it's not on the,ep048
1344,goal here and we're not seeing the,ep048
1347,whites and price being already at 8:35,ep048
1350,how much more money we'll need to put,ep048
1353,into the backyard to get it where it,ep048
1356,needs to be I'm getting a little nervous,ep048
1359,about our budgets we're just gonna have,ep048
1362,to run some numbers okay since none of,ep048
1365,the homes are exactly what either of,ep048
1368,them wants their decision may come down,ep048
1371,to whether being on the water is worth,ep048
1374,the extra money the beach was my,ep048
1377,backyard it doesn't get any better than,ep048
1380,that,ep048
1383,[Music],ep048
1386,some beachy stuff okay,ep048
1389,chairman Ksenia are on the hunt for a,ep048
1392,home for their kids in Destin Florida,ep048
1395,with their 1.2 million dollar max budget,ep048
1398,they've seen their options and now it's,ep048
1401,time to decide let's think about the,ep048
1404,first one we saw the Cape Cod what do,ep048
1407,you think of that one,ep048
1410,Paul the price was $7.99 definitely,ep048
1413,within my budget was also within yours I,ep048
1416,like the way it looks from the front but,ep048
1419,I did not like how far it was from the,ep048
1422,beach you know that was very important,ep048
1425,to me yeah the thing that concern me the,ep048
1428,most is that it didn't have a pool and,ep048
1431,it right now it's only three bedrooms to,ep048
1434,make it more it'll require a lot of more,ep048
1437,work I love the amount of parking I like,ep048
1440,that the rooms were spacious let's talk,ep048
1443,about that condo that you liked so much,ep048
1446,you know I love those views it wasn't a,ep048
1449,townhouse like I was hoping for but that,ep048
1452,was the closest to my wish list all the,ep048
1455,space we need they had the four bedrooms,ep048
1458,but what scares me is price being a,ep048
1461,"million 185,000 already how much we can",ep048
1464,get some of that back on rental it won't,ep048
1467,be that bad I mean Don was right it's a,ep048
1470,good place to invest on the beach,ep048
1473,those views are what we hear but I mean,ep048
1476,the other reason is is to have a nice,ep048
1479,backyard to have family here,ep048
1482,the beach was my backyard it doesn't get,ep048
1485,any better than that,ep048
1488,what did you think about the beach,ep048
1491,cottage there were so many things I,ep048
1494,liked about that beach cottage first of,ep048
1497,"all the price was 835,000 it was only a",ep048
1500,half a block from the beach and it,ep048
1503,actually already had a pool yeah but,ep048
1506,let's talk about that yard it was dirt,ep048
1509,yeah actually it is dirt and let's not,ep048
1512,forget it wasn't really on the sand like,ep048
1515,I was hoping,ep048
1518,no it wasn't on the sand okay so what do,ep048
1521,you want to do,ep048
1524,[Music],ep048
1527,that beach cottage I think it works for,ep048
1530,me and I think it could also work with,ep048
1533,you it already has a pool in place and,ep048
1536,we can make that backyard around I'm,ep048
1539,totally comfortable with the price even,ep048
1542,with the stuff that we still need to do,ep048
1545,in the end it's only three homes down,ep048
1548,from the beach the walk isn't that far I,ep048
1551,think I'll be really happy in this house,ep048
1554,great so you're talking about putting,ep048
1557,the Black Rock around the border and,ep048
1560,then the white in between shortly but,ep048
1563,meeting me throw ideally the pool is,ep048
1566,pretty much considered evening it feels,ep048
1569,wonderful to be in this new vacation,ep048
1572,home I'm very happy it wasn't a love at,ep048
1575,first sight but the more time I spend,ep048
1578,here the happier I get we don't want to,ep048
1581,be giving him too much there's a lot of,ep048
1584,projects in this house Jennifer Stan,ep048
1587,what about the disparity of practice,ep048
1590,mogoblin DOMA yeah we just a house was,ep048
1593,listed for eight hundred and thirty five,ep048
1596,thousand and negotiated a little bit,ep048
1599,with Destin we got a really good deal we,ep048
1602,think an eight hundred thousand put an,ep048
1605,offer in two months ago we closed about,ep048
1608,three weeks ago and we got the keys,ep048
1611,about a week ago it is a work in,ep048
1614,progress,ep048
1617,but we already got some things started,ep048
1620,started painting the house and doing,ep048
1623,extra other things to the backyard it's,ep048
1626,looking better every day,ep048
1629,I like the plants that you chose do you,ep048
1632,know what they are you know I have no,ep048
1635,clue the biggest challenge is trying to,ep048
1638,find a place that would look for both of,ep048
1641,us,ep048
1644,I mean she wanted to be on the beach I,ep048
1647,wanted to have a family home but I think,ep048
1650,this is close enough to the beach and it,ep048
1653,gives us that family-friendly home that,ep048
1656,we were looking for and all the space we,ep048
1659,need right now we have both parents with,ep048
1662,us and there's plenty of room for the,ep048
1665,whole family,ep048
1668,I don't think we could have done that in,ep048
1671,a condo,ep048
1674,[Music],ep048
1677,the vision of the backyard is for a,ep048
1680,great place for a family to play you,ep048
1683,know from Mikey to play on the grass,ep048
1686,first if you get to be in swimming pool,ep048
1689,so that's what I hope to get when we're,ep048
1692,all done and we're just super excited to,ep048
1695,actually enjoy this home and have our,ep048
1698,first family function here first pool,ep048
1701,party at the house how do you say,ep048

81,first time in 37 years that we are gonna,ep049
84,be living together full-time not a,ep049
87,professional dog show handler it was,ep049
90,nothing for me to be gone a week or two,ep049
93,at a time we realized we were in a real,ep049
96,rut we didn't even know what to say to,ep049
99,each other half the time it was like how,ep049
102,was your day fine how was your day fine,ep049
105,and that was it in Belize we'll never be,ep049
108,more than four or five hours that we'll,ep049
111,be apart from each other oh boy are you,ep049
114,excited to be perfectly honest with you,ep049
117,absolutely we don't kill each other we,ep049
120,started going to Belize about three,ep049
123,years ago it just grabbed our hearts the,ep049
126,people are friendly and it's warm all,ep049
129,year long well as you can tell from what,ep049
132,I'm going right now I have no rhythm and,ep049
135,we're taking our four-legged furry kids,ep049
138,with us dolly and Hunter and Lisa,ep049
141,they're a big part of our lives they're,ep049
144,like our children you think we're crazy,ep049
147,for doing this,ep049
150,I think we're crazy good for doing this,ep049
153,my biggest fear of going to Belize is,ep049
156,living off of our savings but we can,ep049
159,grab life by the horns down there and,ep049

174,for its laid-back lifestyle friendly,ep049
177,locals and questionable roads the roads,ep049
180,are generally not great and when,ep049
183,traveling in a golf cart that can be,ep049
186,bumpy and not always fun the real-estate,ep049
189,market on ambergris Key is quite strong,ep049
192,but our inventories are dwindling,ep049
195,quickly we're very different from a,ep049
198,personality standpoint I'm more just,ep049
201,scoping things out first before I make a,ep049
204,decision where she'll jump right at a,ep049
207,decision right away and she decided we,ep049
210,should go to Belize it was a hundred and,ep049
213,ten percent we're looking for two,ep049
216,bedrooms two baths we want to be south,ep049
219,of town,ep049
222,we want to be close to town okay one of,ep049
225,the main things for me,ep049
228,is this beautiful view I want to wake up,ep049
231,every morning and see that view well,ep049
234,that sounds like you got your head on,ep049
237,straight then that's perfect and if,ep049
240,possible I really like to keep the,ep049
243,density of the complex smaller okay so,ep049
246,not necessarily a resort style program,ep049
249,okay it has to be pet friendly so we,ep049
252,brought three dogs with us tell me the,ep049
255,most important question what's the,ep049
258,budget it's really important that we,ep049
261,"stay within $400,000 well keep in mind",ep049
264,that's his budget I don't have problem,ep049
267,spending more money I never have,ep049
270,all right well based on the budget we're,ep049
273,gonna have trouble finding some,ep049
276,properties for you to look at no,ep049
279,pressure,ep049
282,we're gonna be living off our savings,ep049
285,and they're gonna have to keep it on the,ep049
288,budget but for me we're ready to blow it,ep049
291,out the water with properties at a,ep049
294,premium Josh decides to kick things off,ep049
297,with the wow factor he knows Susan will,ep049
300,appreciate but we are located about 3.5,ep049
303,miles south of town here and about a,ep049
306,mile and a half off the paved road,ep049
309,okay well it's a little bit further,ep049
312,south of town than we wanted to be so,ep049
315,this is a small complex only nine units,ep049
318,three-bedroom three and a half baths Wow,ep049
321,it's a big one so it's the price go a,ep049
324,little higher the list price of the,ep049
327,property is five hundred and twenty-five,ep049
330,thousand dollars oh wow that's like way,ep049
333,over the budget yeah this is gorgeous,ep049
336,oh dear God the kitchen I don't know,ep049
339,where to look first the view the kitchen,ep049
342,take a look at the ceiling i lo glass,ep049
345,tile backsplash vented microwave,ep049
348,dishwasher Wow screen also these are no,ep049
351,slam cabinet doors and drawers well,ep049
354,that's no fun would I get mad,ep049
357,Wow absolutely gorgeous huh you've got,ep049
360,the pool over on the side here you'll,ep049
363,get sunrises and sunsets from the,ep049
366,veranda,ep049
369,that's wonderful love it love it love it,ep049
372,but there is a concern with the dogs,ep049
375,being able to run out one to the beach,ep049
378,and not be in contain look at the curved,ep049
381,wall Randy yeah Wow in each of the rooms,ep049
384,there's an individual split unit a/c so,ep049
387,you can cool only the rooms that you,ep049
390,need to and that will save you money,ep049
393,that's for sure oh my gosh look at this,ep049
396,I don't know about this family they just,ep049
399,glide gonna give me a haircut what are,ep049
402,those fans meant to do,ep049
405,I just can't figure it out at all this,ep049
408,is a nice big second room you know this,ep049
411,would make a good office because you're,ep049
414,gonna have to keep working you into it,ep049
417,that wasn't part of the plan,ep049
420,well you know plans change you can do it,ep049
423,boob for me huh come on,ep049
426,okay thanks oh this is really nice this,ep049
429,would make a great kennel room for the,ep049
432,dogs there's an ensuite and we could,ep049
435,convert that into a dog washing room I,ep049
438,love this really needs final care if,ep049
441,it's a little bit more expensive,ep049
444,Susan can usually talk me into a lot of,ep049
447,things but we would have a little bit of,ep049
450,struggle with money for a while we would,ep049
453,probably spend more time together though,ep049
456,because we wouldn't be able to go,ep049
459,anywhere else I'm gonna have to like,ep049
462,break his arm behind his back and say,ep049
465,you're gonna buy this place,ep049
468,Josh tips the price in Randy's favor 307,ep049
471,five thousand that's really good but,ep049
474,Susan's not so easily impressed this is,ep049
477,a little awkward here I don't like that,ep049
480,view this would have to go that's not my,ep049
483,style,ep049
486,[Music],ep049
489,got it yeah you're making a mess a,ep049
492,much-needed life changes bringing Susan,ep049
495,and Randy to believe we came to realize,ep049
498,that we have to make a big move it's,ep049
501,really truly gonna be like starting over,ep049
504,again how we don't murder each other,ep049
507,from being together so much but Randy's,ep049
510,worried that his bride of 37 years will,ep049
513,empty the bank account in the process,ep049
516,we're gonna be living off our savings,ep049
519,and it's it's a little scary,ep049
522,Randy definitely is the one that's gonna,ep049
525,want to stick to the budget me I'm ready,ep049
528,to blow it out the water so I think,ep049
531,that's where our disagreements are gonna,ep049
534,fly I don't like to compromise the,ep049
537,minute we got off the plane in ambergris,ep049
540,key we looked around and we said yep,ep049
543,this is for us whose idea was it again,ep049
546,tell me whose idea and we're taking our,ep049
549,four-legged furry kids with us he'll eat,ep049
552,that they're a big part of our lives,ep049
555,they're like our children you ready to,ep049
558,go Randy's style in a house is is just,ep049
561,he doesn't die oh he'd be happy with a,ep049
564,leather chair a TV and a can of beer so,ep049
567,absolutely,ep049
570,luxury house one gives them a taste of,ep049
573,the good life I don't know where to look,ep049
576,first the view the kitchen you've got,ep049
579,the pool over on the side here you'll,ep049
582,get sunrises and sunsets love it love it,ep049
585,love it but there is a concern with the,ep049
588,dogs not being contained and I'm really,ep049
591,concerned about the budget Susan and,ep049
594,Randy have a clear understanding of what,ep049
597,they're looking for but different price,ep049
600,points so I think it's gonna be a,ep049
603,challenge to find them everything that,ep049
606,they wanted,ep049
609,[Music],ep049
612,for the next place Josh sticks to the,ep049
615,premium real estate of the south side of,ep049
618,the island but is still able to sneak,ep049
621,under the budget for Randy the complex,ep049
624,is a little bit larger than you were,ep049
627,looking for with 20 units and there's,ep049
630,two swimming pools a doggy pool we're,ep049
633,gonna be looking at a three-bedroom,ep049
636,two-bath and best of all under budget,ep049
639,three hundred and seventy-five thousand,ep049
642,oh wow this is really nice I like the,ep049
645,kitchen,ep049
648,yeah nice kitchen you've got some of,ep049
651,those hardwood accents that Belize is so,ep049
654,famous for this is a little awkward here,ep049
657,why bother having barstools you've got,ep049
660,this here I think I'll get too much of a,ep049
663,headache from Susan with respect to,ep049
666,reorganizing the house she's the one,ep049
669,that leads to the show I like that view,ep049
672,it's just not it's too it's too closed,ep049
675,off let's see how big the patio is,ep049
678,[Music],ep049
681,beautiful oh that's gorgeous look at the,ep049
684,little seats down there for the bar,ep049
687,really like the safety for the dogs,ep049
690,where she can't slip through paddle,ep049
693,boards are those for us to use as well,ep049
696,yeah you can use the paddle boards in,ep049
699,kayaks I think this property would fit,ep049
702,nicely into our goal of spending more,ep049
705,time together we could go paddleboarding,ep049
708,we could take a kayak out where do those,ep049
711,doors leads that's the master bedroom,ep049
714,king-size bed like that enough for us,ep049
717,and the dogs oh my god the shower was,ep049
720,beautiful we have a party in here this,ep049
723,would have to go that's not my style a,ep049
726,good size second bath well that is a,ep049
729,nice size second bath and here's the,ep049
732,second bedroom it's got a king-size bed,ep049
735,and this nice well-lit wall of windows,ep049
738,yeah I like I like the bow windows the,ep049
741,bathroom,ep049
744,not ensuite it's not ensuite but no you,ep049
747,know nice if it was but you know we can,ep049
750,deal with it there's one more view I,ep049
753,really want to show you right oh it's,ep049
756,just gorgeous and a dog Randy in case,ep049
759,you're allowed to get a boat Hey under,ep049
762,budget so I think that'd be fantastic,ep049
765,while it appears to tick all the boxes,ep049
768,on paper it doesn't tick all the boxes,ep049
771,in reality I didn't care for the doors,ep049
774,that let out because I thought it,ep049
777,blocked too much of the view this is,ep049
780,under budget,ep049
783,so this would be better for us we're,ep049
786,never gonna be able to have the view,ep049
789,here that we have at the luxury property,ep049
792,you can't how can you compare the two,ep049
795,money Josh struggles to meet Susan and,ep049
798,Randy halfway it's still a little bit,ep049
801,over budget oh come on it's not that,ep049
804,much over budget but I'm not sure about,ep049
807,that table don't care for the barstools,ep049
810,either of course that's the one thing I,ep049
813,really do like what do you think Lisa do,ep049
816,you like it,ep049
819,Susan and Randy are reconnecting in,ep049
822,Belize I would have to give him kudos,ep049
825,for living with me for 37 years,ep049
828,because I'm always causing trouble but,ep049
831,we make a pretty good team because I'll,ep049
834,push him yeah to get out of his comfort,ep049
837,zone and he will reign me back in it is,ep049
840,extremely important that we're able to,ep049
843,take our dogs with us donkey got you,ep049
846,ready to go for you new home they're not,ep049
849,just dogs they're our family I remember,ep049
852,the first time I went down there and,ep049
855,I'll zooming up the beach and one of the,ep049
858,locals looked at me says yo man you,ep049
861,Russian I said I'm not Russian,ep049
864,you looked at me said then what you,ep049
867,rushing for that's great,ep049
870,the main difference for us is he's so,ep049
873,budget conscious and I really don't care,ep049
876,too much about the budget but ambergris,ep049
879,he's tough rental market is giving them,ep049
882,a run for their money,ep049
885,the real estate market on ambergris key,ep049
888,is quite strong but our inventories are,ep049
891,dwindling quickly and I think that Randy,ep049
894,is scared about our ability to find a,ep049
897,unit that's gonna suit them in terms of,ep049
900,the budget and I feel the same way so,ep049
903,this is a three bedroom three and a half,ep049
906,bath,ep049
909,Wow it's a big one the list price of the,ep049
912,property is five hundred and twenty-five,ep049
915,thousand dollars Wow I don't care if,ep049
918,it's a little bit more expensive you're,ep049
921,gonna have to keep working into it that,ep049
924,wasn't part of the plan you know plans,ep049
927,change,ep049
930,house two is easier on Randy's budget,ep049
933,"three hundred and seven 5,000 but I",ep049
936,don't like that view it's too closed off,ep049
939,we're never gonna be able to have the,ep049
942,view here that we have at the luxury,ep049
945,property how can you compare the two,ep049
948,money the only conflict I can see is,ep049
951,that Susan will get what she wants and,ep049
954,I'm not sure that that's conflict at all,ep049
957,Josh finally finds a place that could,ep049
960,meet Susan's high standards without,ep049
963,breaking the bank but getting there is,ep049
966,another thing the roads are generally,ep049
969,not great and when traveling in a golf,ep049
972,cart that can be tedious bumpy and not,ep049
975,always fun,ep049
978,their jobs where are you taking us yeah,ep049
981,so the entrance isn't perfect,ep049
984,very nice only ten units on two hundred,ep049
987,feet of beachfront Wow,ep049
990,the unit here is two-bedroom two-bath,ep049
993,and it's right there Wow and it's listed,ep049
996,at four hundred and sixty-five thousand,ep049
999,well it's still a little bit over budget,ep049
1002,oh come on it's not that much over,ep049
1005,budget Wow coming up those stairs every,ep049
1008,time I have to take the dogs out that's,ep049
1011,gonna be something Oh,ep049
1014,grandi look at the view who cares about,ep049
1017,the stupid steps everywhere you look,ep049
1020,windows windows windows but I'm not sure,ep049
1023,about this furniture what do you think,ep049
1026,yeah it's looks a little dated yes,ep049
1029,definitely not your style no I'm not,ep049
1032,sure about that table either that might,ep049
1035,have to be replaced,ep049
1038,I don't care for the barstools either I,ep049
1041,think I might have you remove this I,ep049
1044,don't like this we've never lived in a,ep049
1047,house where Susan hasn't begun,ep049
1050,remodeling almost immediately if we move,ep049
1053,in here we're gonna have to keep it as,ep049
1056,is for quite a while one thing that I,ep049
1059,really wanted to do is to be able to,ep049
1062,walk out on the veranda walk right down,ep049
1065,and be on the beachfront not with the,ep049
1068,pool first the beach is what 15 steps,ep049
1071,away get over it what do you think Lisa,ep049
1074,do you like it,ep049
1077,Lisa seems to like it okay could have a,ep049
1080,dance floor here you know how we like to,ep049
1083,dance okay master Oh straight in here,ep049
1086,like this look at that view can you,ep049
1089,imagine waking up to that every day is,ep049
1092,fantastic and I love the furniture in,ep049
1095,here so that'll save me some money oh my,ep049
1098,gosh the color,ep049
1101,holy mackerel is that bright we might,ep049
1104,want something different with that of,ep049
1107,course you wouldn't like the orange,ep049
1110,paint that's the one thing I really do,ep049
1113,like I know that's his favorite color,ep049
1116,but for a bathroom it's just too much,ep049
1119,well big I think it's a little dark and,ep049
1122,I'm not a big fan of the furniture I,ep049
1125,think we're gonna have to replace that,ep049
1128,let's take a look at the second bathroom,ep049
1131,so it's it's a nice size really wish it,ep049
1134,was ensuite,ep049
1137,yeah I do too but I guess we'll just,ep049
1140,have to buy bathrobes I don't think,ep049
1143,they're optimistic in terms of our,ep049
1146,ability to find a unit that's gonna suit,ep049
1149,them and they really have to make,ep049
1152,sacrifices and that's gonna be cost so I,ep049
1155,like this unit overall I am a little,ep049
1158,concerned about the steps four or five,ep049
1161,times a day with the dogs that's a lot,ep049
1164,the furnishings need to go they're old,ep049
1167,they're outdated already being over,ep049
1170,budget and now thinking about new,ep049
1173,furnishings that could be a deal-breaker,ep049
1176,for me I like it I like it if I don't I,ep049
1179,don't and I'm not gonna be as budget,ep049
1182,conscious so there you go budget man you,ep049
1185,know I love the luxury condo yeah my,ep049
1188,biggest concern is we're gonna be living,ep049
1191,off our savings and it's a little scary,ep049
1194,what,ep049
1197,Randy doesn't want to go over budget,ep049
1200,Susan couldn't care less it's really,ep049
1203,"important that we stay within $400,000",ep049
1206,keep in mind that's his budget I don't,ep049
1209,the problem spending more money I never,ep049
1212,have and it would be impossible for us,ep049
1215,to go to Belize without our dogs you,ep049
1218,know they're part of our pack we're part,ep049
1221,of their pack and it just wouldn't,ep049
1224,happen if we couldn't take those dogs,ep049
1227,with us but the amount of available real,ep049
1230,estate on ambergris key is shrinking the,ep049
1233,real estate market on ambergris key is,ep049
1236,quite strong but our inventories are,ep049
1239,dwindling quickly you know I love the,ep049
1242,luxury I mean come on what's not to love,ep049
1245,about that,ep049
1248,I don't know where to look first the,ep049
1251,view the kitchen love it I don't care if,ep049
1254,it's a little bit more expensive my,ep049
1257,biggest concern is the budget we would,ep049
1260,probably spend more time together though,ep049
1263,because we wouldn't be able to go,ep049
1266,anywhere else,ep049
1269,house 2 is under budget three hundred,ep049
1272,and seven five thousand so we do have a,ep049
1275,little bit of money to spend not enough,ep049
1278,though I don't think I don't like that,ep049
1281,view it's too closed off did have three,ep049
1284,swimming pools and one for the dogs,ep049
1287,well that's very true house three is,ep049
1290,closer to budget but still not perfect,ep049
1293,I'm not sure about this furniture what,ep049
1296,do you think definitely not your style,ep049
1299,no that might have to be replaced Randy,ep049
1302,we've never lived in a house where Susan,ep049
1305,hasn't begun remodeling almost,ep049
1308,immediately I am concerned about the,ep049
1311,steps look at the view who cares about,ep049
1314,the stupid steps,ep049
1317,[Music],ep049
1320,so we tried to eliminate one yeah I,ep049
1323,think we should probably eliminate,ep049
1326,something I need luxury condos beautiful,ep049
1329,but way over button yeah it was a lot,ep049
1332,I'll tell ya and even for me I don't,ep049
1335,want to have to spend all our money,ep049
1338,there and then there's no containment,ep049
1341,for the dogs man I think we need to,ep049
1344,eliminate that one I think we should go,ep049
1347,with the small community for a,ep049
1350,two-bedroom I thought the living room in,ep049
1353,the dining room in the kitchen all that,ep049
1356,area I thought that was a lot of room,ep049
1359,for us there were a lot of steps going,ep049
1362,up to the second floors every time we,ep049
1365,need to take the dogs out true but it'll,ep049
1368,be a good workout for us but way over,ep049
1371,budget right but over the long term,ep049
1374,right that I don't think that's gonna,ep049
1377,make a big difference so what do you,ep049
1380,think of the large complex,ep049
1383,it had this beautiful view but I didn't,ep049
1386,like the doors that you had to look,ep049
1389,through I thought they were too,ep049
1392,congested the master bedroom can walk,ep049
1395,right out on to the veranda and I really,ep049
1398,liked it because it was under budget,ep049
1401,right but every one of those bathrooms,ep049
1404,is gonna need to be redone at some point,ep049
1407,and it just didn't have the flow that I,ep049
1410,really liked the small community one it,ep049
1413,was like one road off of the main road,ep049
1416,yeah that was a good point and that,ep049
1419,veranda on the front was really safe for,ep049
1422,the dogs you're right and the most,ep049
1425,important thing to me is small community,ep049
1428,right I like that one,ep049
1431,well what do you think I think small,ep049
1434,community I agree got it sooner rather,ep049
1437,than later,ep049
1440,let's go,ep049
1443,oh do we look Cathy I'm so excited I,ep049
1446,think we laugh a lot more than we used,ep049
1449,to,ep049
1452,you want a beer yes please I can't wait,ep049
1455,new paint new tile we're gonna get new,ep049
1458,countertops in the kitchen,ep049
1461,let me see really great not to have that,ep049
1464,what's it the island on there it's not,ep049
1467,having that stupid thing they're much,ep049
1470,more open yeah it was really in the way,ep049
1473,we have found a personal trainer and we,ep049
1476,do the training right out here on the,ep049
1479,dock let's do this and hold and Chris,ep049
1482,your ankles are we I don't think so,ep049
1485,we're learning more about each other,ep049
1488,again and we actually sit down and talk,ep049
1491,about things so what's on your schedule,ep049
1494,for two,ep049
12,are you ready to get your bum kicked,ep050
15,again yet when international car rally,ep050
18,drivers crystal and Christian met two,ep050
21,months ago at a race sparks flew I fell,ep050
24,in love immediately now they're on the,ep050
27,move to find a house in Northampton,ep050
30,England the winner chooses the house,ep050
33,it's on I like this thing but this is,ep050
36,really dated,ep050
39,this kitchen is generic but it is over,ep050
42,budget I don't really see the dollar,ep050
45,signs it's very interesting to learn,ep050
48,more and more about crystal I'm super,ep050
51,competitive,ep050
54,crystal just is nuts I'm a little bit,ep050
57,worried about you two living together,ep050
60,[Music],ep050
63,I want to keep everything okay but what,ep050
66,do you actually need all of it,ep050
69,you're gonna wear the hat I'm from,ep050
72,California I have worked in 12 or so,ep050
75,countries with horses I'm just kind of,ep050
78,all over the place I'm from Germany from,ep050
81,a really tiny village I was steering a,ep050
84,car rally and he shows up and proceeded,ep050
87,to chase me for around 15 countries or,ep050
90,so he finally caught me we found out,ep050
93,we're soul mates pretty quickly we're a,ep050
96,couple for two months now that only,ep050
99,happens in movies my fear is that it's,ep050
102,too good to be true and now you have to,ep050
105,adjust with domestic life we'll see how,ep050
108,that works,ep050
111,Christian's taking a once-in-a-lifetime,ep050
114,opportunity here in Northampton a job as,ep050
117,an automotive engineer but this is one,ep050
120,country where crystals visa doesn't,ep050
123,allow her to work we are gonna be on a,ep050
126,single income that's a huge castle oh,ep050
129,that's the castle okay looks like a,ep050
132,house to me to look for actual houses,ep050
135,the car lovers need a way to get around,ep050
138,so crystal picked up something,ep050
141,appropriately English I'm 90% sure it's,ep050
144,gonna start,ep050
147,hey let's go coming to Northampton I'm,ep050
150,definitely putting a lot of faith in,ep050
153,Christian it's very scary to kind of,ep050
156,take that leap of faith especially when,ep050
159,it's as crazy as love Northampton is a,ep050
162,beautiful county town in the East,ep050
165,Midlands of England it's got all of,ep050
168,those kind of menaces that you'd want,ep050
171,like restaurants and cafes Northampton,ep050
174,is a great place to be if you really,ep050
177,like cars because we're right next to,ep050
180,Silverstone once a world war two,ep050
183,airfield Silverstone has become a racing,ep050
186,Mecca and home to the British Grand Prix,ep050
189,the real estate market here in,ep050
192,Northampton is quite buoyant it's,ep050
195,starting to get a bit easier to rent,ep050
198,which could be good for Krystal and,ep050
201,Christian tell me a bit about what it is,ep050
204,you're looking for I'm after a kind of a,ep050
207,bit of a traditional English house which,ep050
210,has some some character I would like,ep050
213,something a bit more modern and spacious,ep050
216,I really want to do some work on like,ep050
219,classic cars and there must be a garage,ep050
222,a garage is very important to me how,ep050
225,much money have you got to spend on this,ep050
228,"property $1,000 I think I'm a little bit",ep050
231,more flexible with the budget because I,ep050
234,do want that kind of luxury if it's,ep050
237,gonna make me happy I don't I don't,ep050
240,really see the dollar signs well let's,ep050
243,head off that idea I don't see ourselves,ep050
246,going over that budget because it's just,ep050
249,not affordable the budget is defined by,ep050
252,me this house search is gonna be really,ep050
255,interesting because crystal and,ep050
258,Christian haven't lived together before,ep050
261,and I'm just wondering how that's gonna,ep050
264,work out so I'm definitely gonna have to,ep050
267,find them a compromise property space,ep050
270,for Krystal the garage for Christian and,ep050
273,beyond budget I'm going to see this,ep050
276,really nice to bed one and a half bath,ep050
279,house it does have a garage and it's on,ep050
282,"budget at $1,000 come on through guys to",ep050
285,the living room oh there we go it's,ep050
288,modern it's,ep050
291,very big it's a bit white and sterile,ep050
294,nondescript furniture a bit of a,ep050
297,hotchpotch to be honest I'm fine with,ep050
300,the furniture of course you would say,ep050
303,that fetch them away we're not looking,ep050
306,for a bachelor pad we're looking for our,ep050
309,home you're going to really like the,ep050
312,kitchen I think crystal yeah it's very,ep050
315,big it's very modern this kitchen is a,ep050
318,bit generic no I mean you're not even,ep050
321,gonna be in the kitchen really this is,ep050
324,kind of my domain Kristen really likes,ep050
327,the interior of the house I'm a bit,ep050
330,drawn because it doesn't have this,ep050
333,British feeling there is a fridge there,ep050
336,so we have the oven we have the fridge,ep050
339,is there a dishwasher in here no there,ep050
342,isn't a dishwasher well there is,ep050
345,dishwasher because I brought one and his,ep050
348,name is Christian Oh,ep050
351,let's go up and look at the bedrooms so,ep050
354,this is the master bedroom guys okay,ep050
357,this is strange what is this Oh now this,ep050
360,is part of the roof structure it makes,ep050
363,the room seem quite small actually cause,ep050
366,it kind of takes away half of the room,ep050
369,that's it I think this is plenty of,ep050
372,space for a bedroom now this is the,ep050
375,second bedroom as you can see it's set,ep050
378,up as an office all we really need it,ep050
381,was an office it's pretty light and,ep050
384,spacious kind of workplace I like that,ep050
387,about it it's a fairly big bathroom it,ep050
390,has a bathtub and it's got some shelf,ep050
393,space here I see which is nice for all,ep050
396,my stuff it's very interesting to learn,ep050
399,more and more about crystal now I,ep050
402,realized she's really looking for,ep050
405,something modern and I wanted something,ep050
408,cozy a bit more old-school so Christian,ep050
411,can you see yourself in here a tinkering,ep050
414,on your classic cars honestly the garage,ep050
417,is a bit small I struggle a bit to see,ep050
420,where put my stuff and how I can make it,ep050
423,a nice workshop Christian you know he,ep050
426,really wanted the garage and now it's a,ep050
429,garage and he's kind of not really happy,ep050
432,about it,ep050
435,so I think he's gonna need a little,ep050
438,a reality check tell me what you think,ep050
441,about the prophecy overall it is modern,ep050
444,for me but at the same time it's not,ep050
447,very spacious the garage is not perfect,ep050
450,it's a bit small in my mind,ep050
453,unfortunately the property didn't,ep050
456,deliver traditional kind of character,ep050
459,and charm I was looking for I really,ep050
462,want to see property which has crystals,ep050
465,thresholds and see whether I can push,ep050
468,the compromise on my side of it I feel a,ep050
471,bit torn between the two of them really,ep050
474,this is about this new issue and they,ep050
477,need us to meld their desires together,ep050
480,really into something that's going to be,ep050
483,achievable now how is this for a garage,ep050
486,Christian I think we don't have to see,ep050
489,another property you're gonna have to,ep050
492,sleep out here when we fight I'm,ep050
495,guessing that's a bet that's the bedroom,ep050
498,moment the house was surprisingly cute,ep050
501,know this I'm a little bit worried about,ep050
504,you two living together in Northampton,ep050
507,England amateur car rally drivers,ep050
510,Bristol and Christian are looking for a,ep050
513,house and they're moving or fast I was,ep050
516,in a car rally and I was driving from,ep050
519,England to Mongolia and along the way I,ep050
522,met Christian and we're a couple for two,ep050
525,months now Christian's taken a job here,ep050
528,as an automotive engineer and crystals,ep050
531,come to put down roots after ten years,ep050
534,of exploring the world I was not a,ep050
537,commitment person I couldn't even commit,ep050
540,to a country I thought it's time to let,ep050
543,you out in the world and I arranged a,ep050
546,little team it's very fancy to have to,ep050
549,do the air kinky now it's just try to,ep050
552,look a bit posh I'm going for it sorry,ep050
555,look I'm definitely not posh is it easy,ep050
558,to tell yes today they're discovering,ep050
561,that the first blush of love doesn't,ep050
564,guarantee they'll agree on everything,ep050
567,when we got to know each other we found,ep050
570,out we're soul mates,ep050
573,pretty quickly but we never had our,ep050
576,domestic life Christian is the opposite,ep050
579,of me whereas I'm kind of spontaneous he,ep050
582,thinks things through and after seeing,ep050
585,only one property,ep050
588,yeah those differences are coming to the,ep050
591,surface oh there we go that's actually a,ep050
594,very modern fit why think sterile I'm,ep050
597,fine with the furniture of course you,ep050
600,would say that catch the boy,ep050
603,there isn't a dishwasher well there is,ep050
606,dishwasher because I brought one,ep050
609,and his name is Christian Oh my biggest,ep050
612,challenge is trying to marry the need,ep050
615,for a nice big garage with a nice space,ep050
618,and two bedrooms they're gonna have to,ep050
621,make some tricky decisions so we're,ep050
624,coming up to our next property now it's,ep050
627,a really nice traditional English,ep050
630,property there we go now how is this for,ep050
633,a garage Christian I think we don't have,ep050
636,to see another property what we've got,ep050
639,here is a 1-bed 1-bath farmhouse just,ep050
642,one bed,ep050
645,it is crystal I'm afraid but it's got,ep050
648,this massive garage and we're under,ep050
651,budget at $900 Oh oh that's good yeah,ep050
654,but with one bed you're gonna have to,ep050
657,sleep out here what we fight oh I'm a,ep050
660,little bit worried about you two living,ep050
663,together well let's go and have a look,ep050
666,so come on through,ep050
669,Oh oh my what do you think okay it's,ep050
672,super British this house is older than,ep050
675,my country I guess the house just feels,ep050
678,lovely it's very cozy a lot of woods and,ep050
681,beams and stuff so I really enjoy being,ep050
684,in there you have got appliances here,ep050
687,but the washing machine the fridge the,ep050
690,oven I like this thing,ep050
693,but this is really dated it's dated but,ep050
696,I really kind of I like the style now,ep050
699,we've got this very nice quirky era here,ep050
702,to try your clothes no this kitchen,ep050
705,we're gonna have like guests and our,ep050
708,Underpants are gonna be in the you have,ep050
711,nice Underpants,ep050
714,I've never seen something like this and,ep050
717,I've been to a few places it's amazing,ep050
720,just have to coordinate the timing,ep050
723,between dryer,ep050
726,and guests are I think so this is the,ep050
729,bathroom guys it's very small it's cute,ep050
732,but you know it's clean and functional,ep050
735,isn't it it's nice I think if I had sent,ep050
738,Kristian here on his own he would just,ep050
741,totally overlook the home aspect and,ep050
744,just see he looks at things for,ep050
747,functionality and not necessarily what's,ep050
750,a home that's kind of my job so we have,ep050
753,this lovely big oh I'm guessing that's a,ep050
756,bet that's the bedroom I think it's cozy,ep050
759,you know and if you get fed up living,ep050
762,crystal you just push them over the edge,ep050
765,I feel like locate again it's what we,ep050
768,call in the business a loft style,ep050
771,bedroom a loved loft style as far as us,ep050
774,living together in that house I think,ep050
777,it's definitely gonna cause friction so,ep050
780,guys what do you think of the property,ep050
783,overall I really like the garage it's,ep050
786,huge,ep050
789,the house was surprisingly cute and it's,ep050
792,under budget for me it was a bit small,ep050
795,it's not modern okay well let's go and,ep050
798,see some more all right sorry Richard,ep050
801,thing we have to push start it and break,ep050
804,hmm it's just so focused on the garage,ep050
807,that you don't really care what the,ep050
810,house looks like we're looking for our,ep050
813,home not our garage let's hope she comes,ep050
816,back we have two bedrooms and one bath,ep050
819,bristol this kitchen is for you Wow so a,ep050
822,nice big master bedroom Wow but it has,ep050
825,no carriage Oh,ep050
828,it's countryside here in,ep050
831,Northamptonshire is kind of undulating,ep050
834,hills and picturesque,ep050
837,it's back in to the pink car as Crystal,ep050
840,and Christian looked for a house,ep050
843,Christian's starting a new job here in,ep050
846,Northampton England it's so close to,ep050
849,Silverstone the automotive engineer may,ep050
852,have found the perfect town where,ep050
855,crystal an international car racer can,ep050
858,feel at home it's surrounded by some,ep050
861,really lovely quaint villages,ep050
864,I love the British religious it feels,ep050
867,like England yeah it's kind of the movie,ep050
870,England so if you're seeing that in,ep050
873,movies is either longer oh it's this,ep050
876,military crystal wants a modern house,ep050
879,but Christian wants a traditional,ep050
882,British home which is putting a strain,ep050
885,on their two-month old relationship I do,ep050
888,have some doubts about moving to England,ep050
891,just because it's so new I'm a very,ep050
894,confrontational person and he's just,ep050
897,really not I can definitely see in a,ep050
900,house hunting process that some stuff is,ep050
903,gonna come up I think it's hard to,ep050
906,understand for crystal how important a,ep050
909,garage is for me I want to restore a,ep050
912,classic car and I need space for that,ep050
915,but you see this really nice tube add,ep050
918,one and a half bath house so Christian,ep050
921,can you see yourself in here a tinkering,ep050
924,on your plastic cars honestly and the,ep050
927,garage is a bit small it's very clean,ep050
930,it's very modern this kitchen isn't it,ep050
933,generic no I mean this is kind of my,ep050
936,domain,ep050
939,house two grabbed Christian at first,ep050
942,sight now how is this for a garage,ep050
945,Christian crystal wasn't impressed,ep050
948,that's the bedroom no this okay we're,ep050
951,looking for our home not our garage I,ep050
954,still see them living together sometimes,ep050
957,actually okay the Headroom crystal makes,ep050
960,it quite clear what she's looking for,ep050
963,very handy sofa bed here is all by the,ep050
966,way yeah I'm ignoring its existence okay,ep050
969,so I think at the end of the day I'm,ep050
972,probably gonna have to take more of,ep050
975,crystals boxes and Christians what I'm,ep050
978,gonna do now is try and get one property,ep050
981,that will Wow crystal and in many ways,ep050
984,I'm using this property to test,ep050
987,Christian we have two bedrooms and one,ep050
990,bath 20-minute drive from Northampton,ep050
993,"but it is over budget at $1,200",ep050
996,Christian I've got some bad news,ep050
999,it has no garage oh that's really sad,ep050
1002,I feel bad about it but by the time,ep050
1005,you've seen how beautifully appointed it,ep050
1008,is you're going to understand the price,ep050
1011,tag and you're gonna go for it for,ep050
1014,Christian not having a garage is gonna,ep050
1017,sort of break his heart a bit this,ep050
1020,property doesn't let me do the kind of,ep050
1023,restoration work on the cars I wanted to,ep050
1026,do but at the same time we are looking,ep050
1029,for a couple's home together,ep050
1032,he's definitely gonna have some thinking,ep050
1035,to do now crystal this kitchen is for,ep050
1038,you you've got this lovely oven nice,ep050
1041,clean induction hob it hides you Chris,ep050
1044,so you've got a nice big fridge freezer,ep050
1047,you've got your washing machine and a,ep050
1050,dishwasher just it's also spending a lot,ep050
1053,of money for living in their nice space,ep050
1056,let's have a look at the living room oh,ep050
1059,wow it's light it's huge windows I like,ep050
1062,that,ep050
1065,quite spacious and yet it feels really,ep050
1068,cozy doesn't it right it's really nice,ep050
1071,it's cozy yes now I have a look at the,ep050
1074,bathroom guys - what'd you think this is,ep050
1077,a lovely bath right now wow that's very,ep050
1080,nice it's actually very big and it has,ep050
1083,the two showers a nice big master,ep050
1086,bedroom it definitely suits your style I,ep050
1089,actually really like the windows I like,ep050
1092,how they incorporate the old style of,ep050
1095,the house like the beams and stuff,ep050
1098,you've got the original pearl in,ep050
1101,here that have been really nicely,ep050
1104,restored I could tell when his brain is,ep050
1107,starting to switch on and think and he,ep050
1110,was definitely having some like oh I,ep050
1113,wasn't expecting to want something as,ep050
1116,fancy as this it is really nice to see,ep050
1119,him kind of change over to my side now,ep050
1122,how about this for a second bedroom it's,ep050
1125,so big it's got a lot of space I mean we,ep050
1128,can have a guest room and office yeah,ep050
1131,the space lets us afford a guest room,ep050
1134,yeah now you've seen the whole of the,ep050
1137,property how are you feeling about it I,ep050
1140,mean obviously I really like it kitchen,ep050
1143,space is big and open and has the modern,ep050
1146,appliances as a dishwasher and,ep050
1149,everything my concerns are just it comes,ep050
1152,with a big price tag and it comes with,ep050
1155,the fact that I have to kind of,ep050
1158,compromise on the carriage but I have to,ep050
1161,agree this is a really nice place to,ep050
1164,live in I'm torn I'm not sure how much,ep050
1167,I'm willing to compromise on my own,ep050
1170,comfort and luxury as a German I'm not,ep050
1173,very flexible interesting my mind as,ep050
1176,much chasing as he did to kind of,ep050
1179,capture me if I want something my way at,ep050
1182,the end of the day I'm gonna get my way,ep050
1185,so this is the English summer you told,ep050
1188,me about dating for nearly two months,ep050
1191,crystal and Christian are looking for a,ep050
1194,house in Northampton this is proper,ep050
1197,English sunshine but the competitive car,ep050
1200,racers have turned out to be competitive,ep050
1203,in more ways than one I think it's,ep050
1206,impossible to reason with crystal about,ep050
1209,money and budget and that's thrown a,ep050
1212,wrench into their house hunt I will bend,ep050
1215,her opinions a bit until I get what I,ep050
1218,want at the end of the day I'm gonna get,ep050
1221,my way so the good news is I already,ep050
1224,made the decision,ep050
1227,we are taking the coach-house so,ep050
1230,congrats crystal it's big it's spacious,ep050
1233,it's super modern and I love it Wow me,ep050
1236,coach house is over budget it's just a,ep050
1239,little bit over budget and it has no,ep050
1242,garage that's really sad,ep050
1245,what about the city house the city house,ep050
1248,has a huge kitchen modern appliances it,ep050
1251,does have a carriage oh that's good to,ep050
1254,hear for me yeah that bedrooms quite,ep050
1257,small what about the farmhouse it's nice,ep050
1260,and cozy it's in the landscape yeah but,ep050
1263,it's really small that bet what we've,ep050
1266,got here is a massive garage now it's a,ep050
1269,lot of space I really need a garage,ep050
1272,[Music],ep050
1275,honestly I'm moving to England for you,ep050
1278,and our relationship yeah you're right,ep050
1281,coach-house out thank you,ep050
1284,I think we need the city house but look,ep050
1287,at the farmhouse it's in the countryside,ep050
1290,yeah but it was like a cave like a cave,ep050
1293,I see ourselves there kind of enjoying,ep050
1296,our relationship and kind of cuddling,ep050
1299,Sunday mornings you don't see ourselves,ep050
1302,in the house you see yourself in the,ep050
1305,garage the city house has a garage as,ep050
1308,well and I'm sure you can make it work I,ep050
1311,don't feel like I am in England when I'm,ep050
1314,in that house I'm sacrificing a lot,ep050
1317,coming to this country for your job if I,ep050
1320,have to compromise so do so I think it,ep050
1323,needs to be City House,ep050
1326,I mean you have a good point there I,ep050
1329,think we go for the city house I knew we,ep050
1332,would so what are you making it's one of,ep050
1335,those vegetarian dishes so now that we,ep050
1338,have our own space it's somehow it,ep050
1341,happened that these different goals,ep050
1344,merged into goals we have together we,ep050
1347,made a bucket list,ep050
1350,it wasn't my goals and his goals anymore,ep050
1353,it was now our goals and we've already,ep050
1356,checked off like quite a lot on our look,ep050
1359,at this at least in our new kitchen we,ep050
1362,can actually do this every day I'm so,ep050
1365,glad I can wash dishes every day now I'm,ep050
1368,very happy how the garage turned out as,ep050
1371,well one of the biggest changes so far,ep050
1374,is that my left hand got a bit heavier,ep050
1377,so we're married now moving it's just,ep050
1380,open just a whole new life,ep050
1383,[Music],ep050
1386,you,ep050
12,[Music],ep051
15,nice yeah pretty nice New Yorkers,ep051
18,Stephanie and fiance rare on the hunt,ep051
21,for their first house on Long Island,ep051
24,it's a good-size property,ep051
27,oh look this door oh that's so cool this,ep051
30,is a nice little porch area only issue,ep051
33,they're not the easiest house owners I,ep051
36,am more of a perfectionist an array can,ep051
39,be a little bit stubborn at times really,ep051
42,don't like those windows I see you guys,ep051
45,critiquing nice already huh yeah that's,ep051
48,a cool stove actually I like it I would,ep051
51,never cook anything in there it would,ep051
54,take an act of God to get stuff to cook,ep051
57,on the stove wish the floor wasn't green,ep051
60,though do interests have to deal I think,ep051
63,I could just sharp you in every square,ep051
66,but they'll have to come to terms if,ep051
69,they ever want to own holy ATS you,ep051
72,couldn't pay me to get inside that tub,ep051
75,[Music],ep051
78,I mean that might just be enough my name,ep051
81,is Stephanie and I work for a dental,ep051
84,supply company my name is Raymond and I,ep051
87,am a Union plumber,ep051
90,we're from Patchogue New York I'd say,ep051
93,town in central Long Island we were both,ep051
96,raised here we actually went to the same,ep051
99,high school all throughout but didn't,ep051
102,really know each other then and then we,ep051
105,had some mutual friends met at a party,ep051
108,it's my love engaged Patchogue is great,ep051
111,it's got some really nice little,ep051
114,mom-and-pop shops it's really building a,ep051
117,lot yeah and it's just fun place to go,ep051
120,out at night and hang out with your,ep051
123,friends one of the reasons that we love,ep051
126,Patchogue is our families here go you do,ep051
129,love our families a lot having them be,ep051
132,five minutes away and distance from each,ep051
135,other is really great that proximity has,ep051
138,been especially helpful for these late,ep051
141,20-somethings since neither of them has,ep051
144,left the nest yet so we both still live,ep051
147,at home Long Island is very expensive so,ep051
150,it's hard to really get on your feet,ep051
153,we're finally in a position where we can,ep051
156,move out and buy a house and it's time,ep051
159,they want to buy right and Patchogue so,ep051
162,they can stay by their families but,ep051
165,they've been having a hard time finding,ep051
168,a single-family home they can afford the,ep051
171,house hunt so far has been I'd say,ep051
174,frustrating defeating at times we've,ep051
177,seen probably 70 houses at this point,ep051
180,realtor has kind of become like an uncle,ep051
183,or a friend I would say at this point at,ep051
186,times we were seeing him more than our,ep051
189,own family and they realized that they,ep051
192,may not be the easiest customers either,ep051
195,Maury can be very stubborn at times I'm,ep051
198,a perfectionist,ep051
201,we walk into a really nice house and,ep051
204,we'll walk out because she can't,ep051
207,envision new paint colors on the wall I,ep051
210,mean I just I don't know what to tell,ep051
213,you someone in Patchogue how much I was,ep051
216,like thick 340 so our budget is,ep051
219,"somewhere around 320,000 had about three",ep051
222,bedrooms two baths maybe just what we're,ep051
225,looking for,ep051
228,I really want a master bathroom cuz it's,ep051
231,nice to have a bathroom that no one else,ep051
234,uses we both tend to get ready at the,ep051
237,same time in the morning so having those,ep051
240,two showers would be really helpful,ep051
243,there's a nice house I really like a,ep051
246,split-level house because I like the,ep051
249,fact that when you come in the door you,ep051
252,walk up the stairs which is nice usually,ep051
255,the living rooms to the left,ep051
258,kitchen straight ahead and then the,ep051
261,hallways down to the right or vice versa,ep051
264,also they have big decks and big yards,ep051
267,looks like it might be some kind of,ep051
270,colonial,ep051
273,I really like Colonials I love the,ep051
276,outside of them the shutters on the,ep051
279,windows symmetry of the homes usually,ep051
282,the columns and the covered porches,ep051
285,I think I'd want to redo the siding,ep051
288,though yeah probably,ep051
291,well I wouldn't mind having a,ep051
294,fixer-upper um I like the idea that you,ep051
297,got to make it all of your own I mean he,ep051
300,is a plumber he can do half the work,ep051
303,himself but doing work on a house cost a,ep051
306,lot of money and I'm not gonna be doing,ep051
309,everything for free well we'll see it,ep051
312,doesn't look like it might be pretty big,ep051
315,inside I really love an open floor plan,ep051
318,I think that's one of my biggest things,ep051
321,walking into a house I hate seeing,ep051
324,closed off rooms an updated kitchen,ep051
327,would be great I really love hardwood,ep051
330,floors if we could have them in the,ep051
333,whole house that would be ideal I really,ep051
336,like carpet I feel like if we have kids,ep051
339,it'll be a lot better for the kids to,ep051
342,crawl on the carpet I don't get that the,ep051
345,children thing will throw a few area,ep051
348,rugs down and they're good to go crawl,ep051
351,away I'm gonna win the battle it's,ep051
354,hardwood,ep051
357,we'll find something eventually it's,ep051
360,been a wild ride so we're excited to,ep051
363,find our house now they're in Patchogue,ep051
366,to see yet another home their agent,ep051
369,Antonio's lined up for them really don't,ep051
372,like those windows yeah we can redo,ep051
375,those though that's not a big deal,ep051
378,it's like nice house though yeah I like,ep051
381,the front porch hey guys how are you,ep051
384,yeah I see you guys critiquing nice,ep051
387,already huh yeah okay no problem I,ep051
390,understand it is their first home it's,ep051
393,the biggest investment they're gonna,ep051
396,make so you want to make sure you make,ep051
399,them happy no matter what it takes,ep051
402,so this is a colonial as you can see I,ep051
405,really like that it's a colonial square,ep051
408,footage about 1700,ep051
411,so that is pretty ample space 3-bedroom,ep051
414,2bath and a price about 329 okay let's,ep051
417,go inside I was more looking for a,ep051
420,split-level house but I guess we'll see,ep051
423,what it has inside I actually like that,ep051
426,because it kind of reminds me of a house,ep051
429,will be just so much as soon as you walk,ep051
432,in I don't love that the stairs are as,ep051
435,soon as you walk in that's kind of a,ep051
438,turn-off for me but it looks like,ep051
441,there's wood floor so that seems like a,ep051
444,plus looks like the floor follows in,ep051
447,here that's nice,ep051
450,this is a weird area though it's almost,ep051
453,like they enclosed the old porch so far,ep051
456,the layout doesn't look as open as I was,ep051
459,hoping it would be so maybe might have,ep051
462,to take some walls down I like the,ep051
465,fireplace though you do every nice is,ep051
468,that fake brick Wow look at this it's,ep051
471,wallpaper really that's really weird,ep051
474,that's weird it's all fake okay let's,ep051
477,follow into the dining room now looks,ep051
480,like looks like some more hardwood,ep051
483,floors here yeah I mean I'm not a big,ep051
486,fan of floors but I actually don't mind,ep051
489,needs to smush they're nice and original,ep051
492,and I like that I was pretty surprised,ep051
495,that he liked the hardwood floor in the,ep051
498,house if we refinish it I think it could,ep051
501,be a good compromise this rooms a little,ep051
504,small for a dining area though I mean if,ep051
507,we put a table in here there's not gonna,ep051
510,be any room to walk around yeah it's,ep051
513,very small and what is that fit oh my,ep051
516,god it's all of carpet it's terrible,ep051
519,look so old even if you want to keep,ep051
522,carpet in here we're gonna have to get,ep051
525,new carpet you have the same this is an,ep051
528,older house but of course is the older,ep051
531,house you got to expect more repairs,ep051
534,maybe some comments on this home that,ep051
537,it's old that's enough space for them,ep051
540,but it is a colonial it isn't patch oh,ep051
543,that's also Plus this home but they have,ep051
546,modern appliances dishwasher and,ep051
549,frigerator any stories matter,ep051
552,that's a cool stove actually I like it I,ep051
555,would never cook anything in there I,ep051
558,think it's so cool maybe we could just,ep051
561,bring this to an antique shop it would,ep051
564,take an act of God to get stuff to cook,ep051
567,on the stove these cabinets are weird,ep051
570,too I don't really like these the window,ep051
573,yeah that's weird,ep051
576,I don't know hey honey can you hand me,ep051
579,the salt and pepper through the window,ep051
582,real quick yeah that's weird,ep051
585,okay let's take a peek at the outside,ep051
588,guys,ep051
591,follow me this is a nice little porch,ep051
594,area I could see us sitting out here,ep051
597,maybe in the morning with some coffee or,ep051
600,something,ep051
603,it's all so peaceful guys if you don't,ep051
606,know if you notice we've seen some,ep051
609,houses in the past where you know it was,ep051
612,very noisy you can see it's really quiet,ep051
615,right now such as a plus back inside,ep051
618,they look in on the main floor bathroom,ep051
621,not quite the full bath I was hoping for,ep051
624,just not really our style where you do,ep051
627,have two full baths which is a huge huge,ep051
630,plus yeah first place you're gonna see,ep051
633,one and a half as a powder room but here,ep051
636,and again it's definitely worth,ep051
639,something workable for you guys yeah,ep051
642,something that can actually work they,ep051
645,head upstairs to see the bedrooms an,ep051
648,additional bathroom Wow,ep051
651,geez holy 80s all needs to be redone I,ep051
654,mean the pink countertop in cabinets to,ep051
657,even make that color anymore you,ep051
660,couldn't pay me to get inside of that,ep051
663,tub I like the carpet,ep051
666,I hate the carpet maybe we could rip,ep051
669,this up and put a nice area rug down,ep051
672,instead no I like the cockpit of course,ep051
675,that hates the carpet just scuse me out,ep051
678,I wouldn't rather replace it or at least,ep051
681,put some hardwood in shall we look at,ep051
684,the closet sure yes let's go,ep051
687,all right doubt is a walk-in and it's,ep051
690,not so there's no master bathroom no,ep051
693,there is not a master bathroom I guess,ep051
696,[Music],ep051
699,so guys what do you thoughts on this,ep051
702,home I really I really like the backyard,ep051
705,I didn't like that there wasn't any,ep051
708,master bathroom though yeah that's,ep051
711,that's something we definitely wanted,ep051
714,but you do have two floor best which is,ep051
717,a huge huge plus the upside for the,ep051
720,bathroom would be that we don't have to,ep051
723,share the bathroom when we're getting,ep051
726,ready in the morning they both tend to,ep051
729,get ready at the same time for work so,ep051
732,having that extra shower would really be,ep051
735,helpful I really didn't like the kitchen,ep051
738,at all I think it needs to be gutted,ep051
741,completely I really like that of it I,ep051
744,hope we can keep that over I hope not I,ep051
747,love that most of its hardwood floor,ep051
750,that's nice too I was more looking for a,ep051
753,split-level house so since Ray prefers,ep051
756,split-levels Antonio's lined one up but,ep051
759,they'll have to compromise on bathrooms,ep051
762,it's a three bedroom one and a half,ep051
765,[Music],ep051
768,maybe we'll find a house get that done,ep051
771,and then we can move on to the,ep051
774,engagement party fiancees ray and,ep051
777,Stephanie are keen to leave their,ep051
780,parents homes and begin married life but,ep051
783,first they need to find a house they,ep051
786,know they want to stay near family and,ep051
789,Patchogue but with three hundred and,ep051
792,twenty thousand dollars they still can't,ep051
795,agree on what they want to buy so far,ep051
798,"they've seen a 1,700 square foot",ep051
801,colonial with two full baths and a front,ep051
804,porch for Stephanie but the kitchen and,ep051
807,baths were dated and it came with a,ep051
810,price tag over their budget so real,ep051
813,estate agent Antonio is hoping a lower,ep051
816,price point combined with Ray's,ep051
819,preferred split-level style will hit the,ep051
822,mark only issue it's 15 minutes farther,ep051
825,out in Medford this is nice house yeah I,ep051
828,like the color nice piece of property,ep051
831,also but I don't know about the drive,ep051
834,it's gonna take me even longer to get to,ep051
837,work yeah I know this is a little far,ep051
840,from what we wanted okay guys just a,ep051
843,little bit different this is more like a,ep051
846,split-level this is a split-level house,ep051
849,is this plate loud looks like a ranch I,ep051
852,know it doesn't in the back it actually,ep051
855,tips up so you I should have more room,ep051
858,in the back it's a three bedroom one and,ep051
861,"a half priced at 289,000 and it's",ep051
864,completely remodeled nothing a price,ep051
867,range so maybe you know the distance,ep051
870,from work won't be that bad I don't,ep051
873,really know that there's anything I,ep051
876,could change my mind about the different,ep051
879,commute it just would add on a lot of,ep051
882,time okay it's nice yeah it's pretty,ep051
885,nice I like the floors,ep051
888,they look like original too and they,ep051
891,would just read you know resurface them,ep051
894,look at your loom looks so big right did,ep051
897,you have such a high cathedral ceiling,ep051
900,yeah it gives you a lot of space looks,ep051
903,and give that impression it's as usual,ep051
906,okay in the kitchen all right I like the,ep051
909,floors a lot yeah it's actually really,ep051
912,nice it's different think you could fit,ep051
915,like a table over there two of the,ep051
918,corner yeah that's why I only it's,ep051
921,another note I don't like is that it you,ep051
924,don't have a dining room oh there is no,ep051
927,dining room,ep051
930,no this is called it basic kitchen,ep051
933,dining room combo usually you put a,ep051
936,dining room table right here and that,ep051
939,would pretty much serve the purpose or,ep051
942,you can do the dining room down there,ep051
945,and your keys downstairs as well vice,ep051
948,versa being that the kitchen is not open,ep051
951,I think it would be kind of hard to be,ep051
954,able to host people and have friends and,ep051
957,family,ep051
960,/ okay come on yeah so what would this,ep051
963,be is this supposed to be a bedroom this,ep051
966,you can make it into a den probably a,ep051
969,living room dining room upstairs it's a,ep051
972,little small for a living room,ep051
975,[Music],ep051
978,definitely little smokes but this is a,ep051
981,nice window it's very smaller but there,ep051
984,is a bathroom that is nice to have down,ep051
987,here a little small though just you know,ep051
990,a toilet and I think that's all you,ep051
993,really need for a guest but yeah at,ep051
996,least you enough to go upstairs if you,ep051
999,have to go while you're down here so,ep051
1002,this doesn't actually count toward the,ep051
1005,bedrooms of the house no it's his actual,ep051
1008,space is what this says you still have,ep051
1011,three more bedrooms up top and you still,ep051
1014,have another bathroom okay you know I do,ep051
1017,like having a carpet it's I'm not a fan,ep051
1020,of it I really enjoy the carpet I hope,ep051
1023,it's in the bedroom but I'm happy that,ep051
1026,this carpet down here also okay guys,ep051
1029,this take a look outside it's a good,ep051
1032,size property yeah it's actually pretty,ep051
1035,nice yeah it's nice because we have a,ep051
1038,little bit of a side wall instead of,ep051
1041,just a backyard deck out here I mean it,ep051
1044,could use some work yeah it's definitely,ep051
1047,gonna it's gonna have to be redone back,ep051
1050,inside there are two guest bedrooms,ep051
1053,upstairs leading to the master so not,ep051
1056,much bigger no this is not big at all,ep051
1059,this is what I would want my smallest,ep051
1062,bedroom to be let's take a look at the,ep051
1065,bath bathrooms nice yeah this is,ep051
1068,probably the nicest part of the house,ep051
1071,yeah I really like it the tile is like,ep051
1074,really nice in here okay since we wanted,ep051
1077,the ensuite bed maybe we could just put,ep051
1080,a hole yeah you know door that goes,ep051
1083,through it's unfortunate that there is,ep051
1086,no ensuite master bath in the house it's,ep051
1089,something that we've really been looking,ep051
1092,for but I mean if we can cut that wall,ep051
1095,and make an opening there I don't think,ep051
1098,it would be too bad it's a good,ep051
1101,workaround,ep051
1104,[Music],ep051
1107,what are your thoughts it was nice seein,ep051
1110,a split-level you know we saw the,ep051
1113,colonial and I needed a lot of work this,ep051
1116,is really more turnkey for us the little,ep051
1119,things we had to do is not a big deal,ep051
1122,because of the price point of the house,ep051
1125,so you know it's so affordable for us,ep051
1128,it's definitely not a colonial the,ep051
1131,kitchen we really wouldn't have to spend,ep051
1134,any money on because everything was,ep051
1137,really updated but then you have the,ep051
1140,lack of space for a dining area and,ep051
1143,hosting yard was nice though,ep051
1146,yeah the Earth's nice and I really like,ep051
1149,that master bath yeah yeah the master,ep051
1152,bath is great price point was great,ep051
1155,maybe we could see something a little,ep051
1158,bit closer to downtown Patchogue - okay,ep051
1161,so they're back in Patchogue but right,ep051
1164,away there's an issue I don't like to,ep051
1167,share driveway yeah I could be annoying,ep051
1170,if we have company over what are we fine,ep051
1173,oneechan,ep051
1176,fiance's ray and Stephanie have been,ep051
1179,living in their respective parents homes,ep051
1182,while searching for a place of their own,ep051
1185,in Patchogue New York so you guys,ep051
1188,looking forward to having an empty house,ep051
1191,yes working with a three hundred and,ep051
1194,twenty thousand dollar budget they've,ep051
1197,"seen a 1,700 square foot colonial in",ep051
1200,Patchogue with the two bathrooms they,ep051
1203,want but it was pricey and needed work,ep051
1206,then they looked at a less expensive,ep051
1209,move-in-ready split-level with just one,ep051
1212,and a half baths they liked the big yard,ep051
1215,and main bathroom but the homes location,ep051
1218,would add 15 minutes to Stephanie's,ep051
1221,commute so now they're back in Patchogue,ep051
1224,to see another option Tess is pretty,ep051
1227,nice yeah I like it oh it's really cute,ep051
1230,I could picture like two rocking chairs,ep051
1233,on the porch right there and it's a,ep051
1236,colonial yeah I know it's not really my,ep051
1239,style but it's mine I don't like to,ep051
1242,share a driveway though yeah I could,ep051
1245,maybe be annoying especially if we have,ep051
1248,company over good morning how are you,ep051
1251,okay so this is a farmhouse colonial,ep051
1254,it's basically three bedrooms I want to,ep051
1257,"have bath square footage is 1,300",ep051
1260,prices we hundred seventeen thousand,ep051
1263,five hundred hopefully hopefully that'll,ep051
1266,work for you guys okay I like it in here,ep051
1269,pretty nice I love the floors I like it,ep051
1272,would be carpet but they're so dark and,ep051
1275,perfect yeah,ep051
1278,for the next wine to win those kids,ep051
1281,would give you a proper lighting okay,ep051
1284,guys this will be the dining room area,ep051
1287,it's pretty spacious good size I love,ep051
1290,this this little bar area almost like a,ep051
1293,breakfast nook I'd hate to lose this but,ep051
1296,I kind of love to rip this whole wall,ep051
1299,down and open it up actually give me,ep051
1302,that open concept yeah I don't love the,ep051
1305,floor plan I wanted it to be something I,ep051
1308,was more open and there is that wall,ep051
1311,between the dining room in the kitchen,ep051
1314,that kind of blocks it all off okay we,ep051
1317,can right let's take a look at the,ep051
1320,kitchen guys oh look at this Dora that's,ep051
1323,so cool oh yeah that is nice I don't,ep051
1326,really love the tile in here though way,ep051
1329,they encounter tops I wish that they,ep051
1332,were a darker stain what's that we have,ep051
1335,four baths here guys oh that's nice,ep051
1338,right off the kitchen,ep051
1341,yes wish the floor wasn't green though I,ep051
1344,don't know if that's something we'd be,ep051
1347,able to fix you inches have to deal I,ep051
1350,think I could just sharp you in every,ep051
1353,square Antonio takes them outside to see,ep051
1356,the backyard,ep051
1359,it's actually really deep it's just not,ep051
1362,that wide we could put a little hot tub,ep051
1365,area right here yeah eventually maybe,ep051
1368,when we have some extra money okay guys,ep051
1371,let's go back in upstairs there are two,ep051
1374,guest bedrooms and the full bath Mary,ep051
1377,Brightman here I don't like this door,ep051
1380,though this is such an awkward opening,ep051
1383,yeah when you open it it's gonna open,ep051
1386,right into the sink I just think it's,ep051
1389,kind of in the way there is only one,ep051
1392,shower in the house gonna make it kind,ep051
1395,of difficult for us getting ready in the,ep051
1398,morning and I don't like the idea of,ep051
1401,having to share it with guests that are,ep051
1404,staying over that's not at least could,ep051
1407,be the master oh I love these stairs up,ep051
1410,so cute yeah how kind of separated from,ep051
1413,the rest of the house yeah that's pretty,ep051
1416,that's highlights this wall also it's,ep051
1419,really nice yeah that sounds really cool,ep051
1422,yeah claimed what it's a nice-sized,ep051
1425,master perfect and I love the forest,ep051
1428,these are the same as downstairs still,ep051
1431,oh that's right yeah they uh and it's,ep051
1434,actually a nice-sized room yeah I am,ep051
1437,very excited to see that there's no,ep051
1440,carpet I'm sure Ray's not thrilled about,ep051
1443,it but we'll throw some area rugs down,ep051
1446,and he'll be fine,ep051
1449,the fact that I haven't seen any carpet,ep051
1452,has kind of stinks I really wanted,ep051
1455,carpet,ep051
1458,hey guys have you seen this house what,ep051
1461,are your thoughts is it really my type,ep051
1464,of house but I like the floors a lot,ep051
1467,really wanted at least a little bit of,ep051
1470,carpet in the bedrooms only really,ep051
1473,wanted them you know a master bathroom,ep051
1476,ensuite so that's a little small at the,ep051
1479,end of the day let's tell you don't,ep051
1482,think about it it is it's a big,ep051
1485,investment I want to make sure you guys,ep051
1488,make the right decision now Stephanie,ep051
1491,and Ray have to decide which has more to,ep051
1494,offer the dated colonial with two baths,ep051
1497,the split level or the move-in-ready,ep051
1500,smaller colonial definite have a lot to,ep051
1503,think about yeah I think so eager to get,ep051
1506,out of their parents homes and into one,ep051
1509,of their own fiance's ray and Stephanie,ep051
1512,are ready to decide on a house it's,ep051
1515,about time you guys so make a good,ep051
1518,decision,ep051
1521,yeah so make it soon yeah 3:29 what did,ep051
1524,you think about that one I thought it,ep051
1527,was pretty nice size definitely needed a,ep051
1530,lot of work too and it's already over,ep051
1533,budget and there was no open layout,ep051
1536,either yeah it was three bedrooms and,ep051
1539,two baths which is what we wanted in the,ep051
1542,house I did have a lot of hard one I'm,ep051
1545,not a big fan of hardwood there was some,ep051
1548,carpet too so I guess that would be a,ep051
1551,good compromise,ep051
1554,I hated that fireplace yeah I mean it,ep051
1557,wasn't even a fireplace so I don't know,ep051
1560,if we could even call it that what do,ep051
1563,you think about the split 11 4 289 I,ep051
1566,don't love that it's a split-level I,ep051
1569,know you probably like that though yeah,ep051
1572,I did really love the hardwood floors,ep051
1575,though throughout most of the house that,ep051
1578,was great yeah I feel like the kitchen,ep051
1581,was really nice yeah I love the kitchen,ep051
1584,and that master bath upstairs if we,ep051
1587,could just add that door that'd be great,ep051
1590,one thing I really enjoyed about that,ep051
1593,house was the price it was really really,ep051
1596,far under our budget which is really,ep051
1599,great but then the location I'd have to,ep051
1602,switch my route what do you think about,ep051
1605,that farmhouse colonial for three,ep051
1608,seventeen five I like that house had a,ep051
1611,lot of character I think it might be a,ep051
1614,little too small for what I was looking,ep051
1617,for it was pretty much turnkey which is,ep051
1620,nice and the hardwood floors are great,ep051
1623,in there too yeah I know there's no,ep051
1626,carpet but I mean like I do like the,ep051
1629,character that the hardwood floors bring,ep051
1632,so yeah I really like that a lot too,ep051
1635,there's not really,ep051
1638,openly out we're looking for in the,ep051
1641,kitchen either yeah take someone to,ep051
1644,knock that wall down it would cost a lot,ep051
1647,of money to take a wall down and the,ep051
1650,shared driveway that really bothers me,ep051
1653,sharing the driveway with the next-door,ep051
1656,neighbor I can tell you which one I want,ep051
1659,let me guess the phone I was calling you,ep051
1662,yeah I really love that house no I'd,ep051
1665,actually like that house too I think it,ep051
1668,was pretty good for what we need had so,ep051
1671,much charm and character yeah definitely,ep051
1674,and it needed no work no location I'll,ep051
1677,be great too yeah perfect I'd really,ep051
1680,love to put the couch along that wall,ep051
1683,there and there may be a little corner,ep051
1686,unit here with the TV it a beam eyes me,ep051
1689,we chose the farmhouse colonial listed,ep051
1692,317 five we paid 320 which is right at,ep051
1695,the top of our budget we actually,ep051
1698,haven't been living in the house yet,ep051
1701,we're just working on moving our stuff,ep051
1704,in that's close yeah more clothes for,ep051
1707,the bedroom we have a little bit of work,ep051
1710,to do we want to paint I think the dark,ep051
1713,paint with the white paneling and then,ep051
1716,if we do it on the beams up there I,ep051
1719,think it'll look really good,ep051
1722,someone in the near future we want to,ep051
1725,demo a wall in between the kitchen and,ep051
1728,the dining room the other day I spoke,ep051
1731,with the contractor this is actually all,ep051
1734,brick under here are you kidding we,ep051
1737,punched a little hole in it you can,ep051
1740,actually see the brick in there I guess,ep051
1743,it could be cool if we expose the brick,ep051
1746,and then put some high-top chairs here,ep051
1749,and made this like a little eating area,ep051
1752,yeah I think that would be pretty nice,ep051
1755,our family has grown a little bit since,ep051
1758,we bought the house we actually rescued,ep051
1761,two puppies go play now there you go hey,ep051
1764,I feel like it's nice to continue to,ep051
1767,live in Patchogue it's very familiar and,ep051
1770,everyone's here,ep051
1773,can you guys believe we're finally in,ep051
1776,but now would you ever think it would,ep051
1779,happen,ep051
1782,no feels really good to make this,ep051
1785,purchase together we've been together,ep051
1788,for a while so being able to finally,ep051
1791,make that next step and be ready to make,ep051
1794,it feels good I'm excited about it new,ep051
1797,home,ep051
12,pretty amazing city Jen's uprooting her,ep052
15,young family from Austin Texas to,ep052
18,Barcelona Spain well the timing is a,ep052
21,little crazy because we just had a baby,ep052
24,you excited to move but we have to go,ep052
27,for it we'll miss you a lot,ep052
30,no no no we just need a place to live,ep052
33,yeah,ep052
36,well she's at work by day Martis agreed,ep052
39,to assume the mantle of stay-at-home dad,ep052
42,don't fav the baby in the bidet try not,ep052
45,to but he's got a few conditions I,ep052
48,practiced historical European martial,ep052
51,arts and I need space right just swing,ep052
54,the sword if you're gonna be home more,ep052
57,than me so I want you like it be happy,ep052
60,look at this this is awesome but for me,ep052
63,you know locations so so important you,ep052
66,don't get everything in everyone so at,ep052
69,least get to keep the helmet,ep052
72,[Music],ep052
75,hey buddy this is where your daddy grew,ep052
78,up Marty and Jen have wrapped up their,ep052
81,lives in Austin but need to make a pit,ep052
84,stop before continuing their long,ep052
87,journey abroad so nice we got a chance,ep052
90,to see you guys so you get some quality,ep052
93,time with Holton's we both grew up here,ep052
96,we counsel errs out of summer camp hi,ep052
99,and there was definitely been beginning,ep052
102,a connection of some sort I didn't know,ep052
105,it was gonna turn into you know what,ep052
108,seems no before yeah Austin has been,ep052
111,amazing for us we got married we had a,ep052
114,child can't wait for you to say hola but,ep052
117,we've been talking about living in,ep052
120,Europe for years every time we travel we,ep052
123,dream about how do we live here what are,ep052
126,you doing kid right to the food and then,ep052
129,I was reached out to by a recruiter,ep052
132,about a job in Barcelona you guys have,ep052
135,been working on your passports right,ep052
138,well we did find her birth certificates,ep052
141,one step at a time it's certainly a huge,ep052
144,risk actually picking a pretty,ep052
147,significant pay cut and I gave up a,ep052
150,really amazing job that I love are you,ep052
153,thirsty buddy but if we didn't take this,ep052
156,opportunity I would regret it for the,ep052
159,rest of my life we're gonna miss you it,ep052
162,will be interesting to see how things,ep052
165,play out for us because our daily lives,ep052
168,are gonna be quite different,ep052
171,yeah I think my attention is gonna be,ep052
174,focused on Holton at the beginning like,ep052
177,I'm still gonna miss a lot of the,ep052
180,freedoms that I used to have so this is,ep052
183,gonna make or break us I'm just loving,ep052
186,all these little side streets there's,ep052
189,I think Barcelona's unique because it's,ep052
192,so international you have the sea but,ep052
195,it's not just a touristy beachy face it,ep052
198,has a very rich culture and I think the,ep052
201,Catalan elements makes it very very,ep052
204,special,ep052
207,do you like Barcelona at your feet just,ep052
210,a little bit yeah yeah that's gorgeous,ep052
213,no we just need a place to live as I,ep052
216,think about our new home in Barcelona,ep052
219,location by far I think is the most,ep052
222,important I want to be in the mix of the,ep052
225,city I think we'd really like to be,ep052
228,close to a park to take the kid for a,ep052
231,walk and if there's any way to kind of,ep052
234,triangulate the park and your work with,ep052
237,the studio that I'll be studying at I,ep052
240,practice historical European martial,ep052
243,arts historical martial arts so an area,ep052
246,that's when swords would be great and,ep052
249,that's not something that I'm willing to,ep052
252,compromise on the minimum is we need a,ep052
255,2-bedroom 1-bath okay what kind of style,ep052
258,do you prefer I love the idea of having,ep052
261,something that brings in some of the,ep052
264,traditional Catalan characteristics but,ep052
267,the kitchen has to be updated I don't,ep052
270,think I could deal with anything old,ep052
273,definitely washer and dryer that would,ep052
276,be ideal but we'd like to not really go,ep052
279,"about 1,600 Martin and Jennifer want a",ep052
282,Catalan experience all the traditional,ep052
285,features but they also want the washer,ep052
288,the dryer and all the modern things no,ep052
291,easy house one gets everyone off to a,ep052
294,good start when it comes to location a,ep052
297,10-minute walk to both Jen's office and,ep052
300,Marti studio with a park even closer for,ep052
303,home I was never a beautiful it's called,ep052
306,a born right in the heart of the old,ep052
309,Barcelona yeah it's amazing very lively,ep052
312,and here's the apartment okay has two,ep052
315,"bedrooms one bathroom and it's $1,400 a",ep052
318,month it's great news the less we spend,ep052
321,on our apartment the more we have to,ep052
324,live life so here we are,ep052
327,oh wow,ep052
330,this is good the kitchens pretty,ep052
333,spacious,ep052
336,ya know I like it's a little bit more,ep052
339,open and I would expect okay,ep052
342,the sinks a little rough though and,ep052
345,where do you even start with a fair,ep052
348,writer for Spanish why that's why we're,ep052
351,here,ep052
354,this view is a little strange,ep052
357,pretty typical of this kind of apartment,ep052
360,block to have this interior space which,ep052
363,is pretty useless really it looks like a,ep052
366,rat's escape hatch we can get this is,ep052
369,the washer/dryer no I'm sorry just a,ep052
372,washer okay the kitchen opens up into,ep052
375,the lounge dining area I love how open,ep052
378,it is and I love the exposed brick and,ep052
381,the ceilings are absolutely gorgeous,ep052
384,yeah this is famous charm what do you,ep052
387,think about the size it's smaller than,ep052
390,what I'm looking for as far as being,ep052
393,able to work out and practice swinging,ep052
396,up and down definitely but I'm just not,ep052
399,sure if it's gonna be wide enough I'm,ep052
402,really worried I'm gonna swing a piece,ep052
405,of metal and take a chunk out of a wall,ep052
408,or knock down a lighting fixture you,ep052
411,have a lovely view of the courtyard,ep052
414,that's where I guess you would hang up,ep052
417,her lunch ah right,ep052
420,that'll be something that we would,ep052
423,definitely have to get used to all right,ep052
426,for me I feel like this is a big space,ep052
429,so this could be holding his bedroom but,ep052
432,I know he does not agree yeah because,ep052
435,she's fixated on location it could be a,ep052
438,dumpster but if it was located in a,ep052
441,really great place I think we might move,ep052
444,into it by the end of the week I will,ep052
447,say the one thing is there's not really,ep052
450,a whole lot of light and only the one,ep052
453,window so you get the same view of the,ep052
456,pipes oh I love this brick wall yeah,ep052
459,this is really pretty hallway and this,ep052
462,is the bathroom okay it's good size oh,ep052
465,we got a tub gotta be good for the baby,ep052
468,and a bidet don't bathe the baby in the,ep052
471,bidet please try not to so this is the,ep052
474,master bedroom,ep052
477,oh it's huge yeah I think this like how,ep052
480,the beams and the brick wall go through,ep052
483,the whole house yeah there's a lot of,ep052
486,character throughout this is the little,ep052
489,Terrace,ep052
492,that's definitely not huge but enough,ep052
495,room just sits well you know I was,ep052
498,really hoping for outside workout space,ep052
501,for me the location is absolutely,ep052
504,amazing,ep052
507,100% hits what I jumped about before we,ep052
510,moved here we can walk to work walk to,ep052
513,the studio the park is down the street,ep052
516,some of the things are a little outdated,ep052
519,the kitchen's a little bit older but,ep052
522,tons of character so it pretty well hits,ep052
525,my must-haves I don't know what about,ep052
528,you with this size living room work or,ep052
531,not the room is still a little bit,ep052
534,smaller I think than what I like Jen,ep052
537,will be in the apartment as much as,ep052
540,holton and I will be so I'm really like,ep052
543,to see a much larger space we'll see I,ep052
546,feel like it might be challenging for,ep052
549,the budget in the next property really,ep052
552,cool outdoor space or go far and,ep052
555,impressing me look at this oh my god is,ep052
558,incredible I'm a only concern is we'd,ep052
561,have to figure out how to baby-proof,ep052
564,that's terrifying,ep052
567,[Music],ep052
570,Marty loved life in Austin Texas he got,ep052
573,married we had a child there mrs. Holton,ep052
576,ha,ep052
579,but when Jen accepted an offer abroad he,ep052
582,knew it was a risk worth taking,ep052
585,that's something we've always talked,ep052
588,about doing living in another country,ep052
591,and moving to Spain I think it's forging,ep052
594,our relationship into something more,ep052
597,powerful and I don't want to give up on,ep052
600,that opportunity but one of the things,ep052
603,great is that I'll be able to focus more,ep052
606,on sword fighting and fighting in some,ep052
609,tournaments that I might not have been,ep052
612,able to have a chance to a fight in the,ep052
615,United States what about your house did,ep052
618,your fondant no we're still looking,ep052
621,right now so as I think about our new,ep052
624,life in Barcelona for me location isn't,ep052
627,the biggest I'm gonna fight on that one,ep052
630,but he's gonna be staying at home with,ep052
633,me he's so good so finding a big enough,ep052
636,space that begins bring a sword in an,ep052
639,apartment in the middle of Barcelona,ep052
642,that's stressing me out a little bit to,ep052
645,be honest there's no quarrel when it,ep052
648,comes to house ones location how far,ep052
651,does it for my office a 10 minute walk,ep052
654,Oh amazing man how close is it to the,ep052
657,studio 10 minute walk as well but Marty,ep052
660,raises a flag about square footage I,ep052
663,think it's gonna be too small as far as,ep052
666,being able to work out I'm really,ep052
669,worried I'm gonna take a chunk out of a,ep052
672,wall all right so a bit more space maybe,ep052
675,just swing the sword yeah and definitely,ep052
678,hoping for outside workout space with,ep052
681,that budget they have to sacrifice,ep052
684,something so the next one I'm going to,ep052
687,show them some,ep052
690,that maybe doesn't have as much Spanish,ep052
693,character but it has a lot more size,ep052
696,light outside space and the modern,ep052
699,conveniences I love this little,ep052
702,courtyard it's really charming yeah,ep052
705,there's a lot of stuff here so what,ep052
708,actually is this area is there Chandler,ep052
711,but you have Gracia right next door it's,ep052
714,a very quiet little in clave in the,ep052
717,middle of it all yeah it's such a neat,ep052
720,little pocket of the city but not as,ep052
723,much history as the last neighborhood,ep052
726,that we looked at it's still beautiful,ep052
729,though it is actually further for you to,ep052
732,walk to your studio though it's gonna be,ep052
735,about 25 30 minute walk for you okay,ep052
738,that might be a little tough carrying,ep052
741,all the gear and stuff like that okay,ep052
744,and this is the apartment here it has,ep052
747,two bedrooms one and a half bathrooms,ep052
750,"and is 1,600 ok so right it kind of the",ep052
753,max we'll definitely have to keep that,ep052
756,in mind we're checking it out here we,ep052
759,are whether in the kitchen oh wow this,ep052
762,is huge look at all the counter space,ep052
765,that's the dishwasher that's a,ep052
768,dishwasher yeah and a bigger fridge much,ep052
771,bigger fridge no that's amazing,ep052
774,I don't think I could ask for a better,ep052
777,kitchen so I'm gonna show you the,ep052
780,washer/dryer what you think yeah you,ep052
783,found it I found one yes one definitely,ep052
786,a bonus having a baby and doing laundry,ep052
789,all the time would make our lives easier,ep052
792,and I won't have to learn how to iron so,ep052
795,this is the living dining area all right,ep052
798,nice nice space,ep052
801,yeah I like this the ceilings I feel,ep052
804,like it may be a bit low what do you,ep052
807,think yeah definitely as far as working,ep052
810,out the terrace might be a possibility,ep052
813,look at this,ep052
816,oh my god Wow incredible this is awesome,ep052
819,a jewel in the crown the Sun hits it,ep052
822,perfectly he's incredible,ep052
825,my only concern is we'd have to figure,ep052
828,out how to baby-proof this right off the,ep052
831,living room it'd be so easy for Holton,ep052
834,to get out here so we'd have to be,ep052
837,really really careful but there might be,ep052
840,enough room out here for me to work out,ep052
843,and that's huge,ep052
846,and one of you to work out - yeah this,ep052
849,was a good find obviously I'm not the,ep052
852,one swinging a sword but I think a,ep052
855,workout space is the most important,ep052
858,thing to him and with that view they'll,ep052
861,be really special for him so this is the,ep052
864,main bathroom it's cozy it's nice,ep052
867,there's no bathtub just shower anything,ep052
870,gonna be okay for the baby it'll be a,ep052
873,little bit more difficult but I don't,ep052
876,think it'd be too bad and the second,ep052
879,bedroom okay this is cool,ep052
882,yeah like this room okay great you see,ep052
885,the master bedroom,ep052
888,yeah that's what I'm excited to see nice,ep052
891,this is a really big space yeah it was,ep052
894,two rooms and I knocked it into one it,ep052
897,definitely was not expecting such a big,ep052
900,room and a flat in Barcelona,ep052
903,space yeah no that's genius it's perfect,ep052
906,and you have a walk-in closet just,ep052
909,around the corner there's a walk-in,ep052
912,apartment really,ep052
915,Wow I think Jen really liked this place,ep052
918,she was definitely down with the kitchen,ep052
921,I think if we can,ep052
924,this is Alice Rambo okay this is,ep052
927,supposed to go on all the way up through,ep052
930,the city we've traveled a ton and every,ep052
933,time you're dreaming about how do we,ep052
936,live here seems too crowded I think,ep052
939,someone a apartment around here,ep052
942,I was reached out to by a recruiter,ep052
945,about an opportunity in Europe with,ep052
948,travel company and I had to pursue it,ep052
951,I'm so excited for us yeah because we,ep052
954,are moving to Barcelona for my job our,ep052
957,lives are gonna be very different,ep052
960,oh hey wait let's get home inspector,ep052
963,diamond I have this thing that I get to,ep052
966,kind of focus on the kids are crazy,ep052
969,daddy it's gonna be different for him,ep052
972,he's gonna be a stay-at-home dad with,ep052
975,Bolton part of me is jealous they're,ep052
978,gonna get to be exploring the streets of,ep052
981,our cilona while I'm working but it also,ep052
984,no it's very intense to be with a 17,ep052
987,month old all day Marty he's blinking,ep052
990,Jenna are looking at apartments a little,ep052
993,bit differently she's really big on,ep052
996,location so the first floor that we,ep052
999,visited that's hosting here it is,ep052
1002,location and nothing yeah absolutely,ep052
1005,for Marty the size of the apartment is,ep052
1008,really important he does historical,ep052
1011,European martial arts yeah tall enough,ep052
1014,to swing a sword,ep052
1017,definitely I'm just not sure if it's,ep052
1020,gonna be wide enough practicing martial,ep052
1023,arts with weapons you kind of need a,ep052
1026,little bit more space to do it house 2,ep052
1029,takes them farther from Barcelona's,ep052
1032,gothic quarter this wall Mediterranean,ep052
1035,tiny more modern but it's more of a walk,ep052
1038,to your studio over but delivers on,ep052
1041,workout space for Marty this is awesome,ep052
1044,it's big enough for me to be able to,ep052
1047,practice on or what have you to work out,ep052
1050,- yeah I think the only thing is there's,ep052
1053,not,ep052
1056,you're really big green spacing by you,ep052
1059,know there's always something that's not,ep052
1062,right that's you,ep052
1065,Oh Elaine takes a chance on location,ep052
1068,with house three putting them even,ep052
1071,farther outside Barcelona's city center,ep052
1074,what neighborhood is this,ep052
1077,this is Toro park because this is tore,ep052
1080,apart oh that oh my god right across the,ep052
1083,road from the apartment especially for,ep052
1086,holding having park next door like,ep052
1089,that's really huge for me how far is it,ep052
1092,from Jenn's work it's about a 20 minute,ep052
1095,walk okay a little bit further but,ep052
1098,that's completely doable for you Martin,ep052
1101,it's not doable walking it would be a,ep052
1104,public transport job for you okay so we,ep052
1107,have hot and covered and I'm covered,ep052
1110,we'll have to see what that means for,ep052
1113,you this is the door oh wow,ep052
1116,has two bedrooms and two bathrooms great,ep052
1119,size what is the price it's 1700 okay so,ep052
1122,I'm too far above but that's about look,ep052
1125,the market means the park is amazing,ep052
1128,yeah of course you pay for this,ep052
1131,privileged position in front of the,ep052
1134,playing right across the road well let's,ep052
1137,check it out and,ep052
1140,see oh I'm loving how open the floor,ep052
1143,plan is yeah this is beautiful there's a,ep052
1146,lot of counter space yeah just watch it,ep052
1149,yes check but no washer watch this,ep052
1152,outside frees up space in the kitchen,ep052
1155,that's not huge it's nice and it's open,ep052
1158,plan so you can see you can see,ep052
1161,everything in the apartment yeah that's,ep052
1164,great,ep052
1167,this is the living room with this,ep052
1170,spectacular view party think she was,ep052
1173,talking about the amusement park at the,ep052
1176,doorstep oh wow,ep052
1179,feel the air it's so beautiful oh the,ep052
1182,looking at this now that the windows,ep052
1185,open I think this would give me a heart,ep052
1188,attack this is not child oh you would,ep052
1191,have to find this addition it is a,ep052
1194,beautiful park now so what do you think,ep052
1197,about the rest of the living room I,ep052
1200,think it's definitely wide enough it's,ep052
1203,probably a little bit too short okay for,ep052
1206,swinging could you practice in the park,ep052
1209,actually that's a really good suggestion,ep052
1212,that's not something I really thought,ep052
1215,about but with the space being so closed,ep052
1218,30 seconds and you're there although I,ep052
1221,don't know if he's gonna be loud just,ep052
1224,swing a sword at the park what about the,ep052
1227,furniture there's quite a bit of stuff,ep052
1230,in here,ep052
1233,the big pieces would stay okay it'll be,ep052
1236,this thing everything's negotiable Marty,ep052
1239,so this is the bathroom oh there's a top,ep052
1242,of this one that's cool that's awesome,ep052
1245,this bathroom is huge so this is a,ep052
1248,second bedroom okay so this would be,ep052
1251,Hilton's room I like this this has,ep052
1254,definitely got a lot of room this is the,ep052
1257,master suite,ep052
1260,no master suite oh it's big you're gonna,ep052
1263,like that shower yeah that's awesome,ep052
1266,ed my type of closet this is a sleeping,ep052
1269,area definitely spacious the mornings,ep052
1272,very pretty but it is missing the,ep052
1275,traditional Catalan architecture but,ep052
1278,it's elegant so it's the verdict this,ep052
1281,property blew my mind,ep052
1284,like I was expecting something good,ep052
1287,and came out something amazing it's,ep052
1290,beautiful I mean there's no arguing that,ep052
1293,and the fact that the park is right,ep052
1296,across the street can't be beat for sure,ep052
1299,but it does feel a bit removed from the,ep052
1302,center hustle and bustle of the city and,ep052
1305,it's pretty far from Marty's studio yeah,ep052
1308,that would be difficult I mean the big,ep052
1311,thing for me is it's over budget,ep052
1314,but I really like it and I am gonna be,ep052
1317,home a lot a lot of time with Holton's,ep052
1320,in a lot of time they don't need to,ep052
1323,practice as well everything has a price,ep052
1326,including the ante house you know we,ep052
1329,give a new family we are figuring out,ep052
1332,all of our expenses so I do want to,ep052
1335,tried carefully the part of your one oh,ep052
1338,my god,ep052
1341,there were helmets oh no we're gonna be,ep052
1344,that couple no you're going to be that,ep052
1347,spouse yeah this is manju a castle the,ep052
1350,year after they built it they had to use,ep052
1353,it in a battle oh wow yeah,ep052
1356,Jan and Marty are packing up the entire,ep052
1359,family for a life-changing move from,ep052
1362,Austin Texas to Barcelona Spain it's a,ep052
1365,pretty incredible field what do you,ep052
1368,think the three apartments were oh my,ep052
1371,gosh I have no idea,ep052
1374,for Marty the move means transitioning,ep052
1377,to full-time dad and sword wielding,ep052
1380,martial artist I practice historical,ep052
1383,European martial arts,ep052
1386,what's swords yes any weapons you can,ep052
1389,think of that at night would use I know,ep052
1392,the apartments are gonna be much smaller,ep052
1395,in Barcelona I don't,ep052
1398,know how hard it's gonna be to find a,ep052
1401,living room that's big enough for him to,ep052
1404,practice sword fighting so how do we,ep052
1407,make this decision house one brings the,ep052
1410,ideal location a 10-minute walk to Jen's,ep052
1413,job and Marty's workouts to do but it,ep052
1416,doesn't get them the square footage,ep052
1419,they're looking for swaying up and down,ep052
1422,definitely but I'm just not sure if it's,ep052
1425,gonna be wide enough I'm really worried,ep052
1428,I'm gonna swing a piece of metal and,ep052
1431,take a chunk out of a wall house 2 we,ep052
1434,give Marty practice space on a,ep052
1437,sun-drenched year pretty amazing this is,ep052
1440,a good fun and while it also delivers on,ep052
1443,amenities it misses the Spanish charm,ep052
1446,Jenn's after and with that neighborhood,ep052
1449,still communit for work but there's no,ep052
1452,park nearby that's a big negative house,ep052
1455,3d gets them the park for Bolton but a,ep052
1458,longer commute for Jim and it's even,ep052
1461,farther from the studio probably a,ep052
1464,little bit too short for swinging could,ep052
1467,you find these in the bog actually,ep052
1470,that's a really good suggestion,ep052
1473,while Marty waits on an answer from the,ep052
1476,parks department ahead of Finance weighs,ep052
1479,in it's over budget it's a little above,ep052
1482,budget I fell in love with them,ep052
1485,[Music],ep052
1488,I love the 1-minute Park but I don't,ep052
1491,think it had a single must have to be,ep052
1494,honest yeah I wish those weren't valid,ep052
1497,points so I could push it more but I,ep052
1500,agree the decision gets tougher for me,ep052
1503,you know locations so so important I,ep052
1506,mean the one in the Bohr neighborhood,ep052
1509,that was my favorite location we could,ep052
1512,walk everywhere it was so unique I think,ep052
1515,that's maybe what's drawing me I know,ep052
1518,we're going for the Catalan experience,ep052
1521,but the apartment with the terrace that,ep052
1524,was pretty cool too that view is amazing,ep052
1527,but there's no bathtub and while the,ep052
1530,section of town was beautiful there was,ep052
1533,no big park around so it comes down to,ep052
1536,holding a bit and it's a longer walk to,ep052
1539,the studio and I think in the end time,ep052
1542,is a commodity for me especially with,ep052
1545,dealing with holding at home all day,ep052
1548,long and stuff like that so I think we,ep052
1551,know which one I think it's got to be,ep052
1554,the whole town you will never get an,ep052
1557,experience like this no,ep052
1560,[Music],ep052
1563,today's so it's been up a few months,ep052
1566,since we moved in the apartments amazing,ep052
1569,we upgraded the fridge and that's been,ep052
1572,awesome enlarged so we're making it feel,ep052
1575,like our own and it's just that kind of,ep052
1578,old-world feel to a company that,ep052
1581,sword-swinging so I really enjoy it hone,ep052
1584,the skills with the spoon has gotten so,ep052
1587,much better,ep052
1590,we've been doing a lot of work on it,ep052
1593,good daddy definitely adjusting and,ep052
1596,being a stay-at-home dad it's this one,ep052
1599,I'm trying to know the hardest part is,ep052
1602,definitely leaving our parents say hi,ep052
1605,they're coming over to see you soon,ep052
1608,won't be too long moving to Barcelona,ep052
1611,was without a doubt the right decision,ep052
1614,my job is going really well,ep052
1617,the city has welcomed us with open arms,ep052
1620,I'm really proud of us I think this has,ep052
1623,made us stronger,ep052
1626,[Music],ep052
12,we're here to taste some fantastic Eva,ep053
15,and Alphonse are moving their kids to,ep053
18,Hungary and they want them to savor the,ep053
21,flavor it tastes like they're expanding,ep053
24,their English teaching program from,ep053
27,France to Budapest it's a brand new,ep053
30,concept in Hungary which is great,ep053
33,because we'll be the first ones to do it,ep053
36,but it's also hard because the first,ep053
39,ones to do it after five years in the,ep053
42,South of France there are certain perks,ep053
45,Eva's not willing to give up I'm so used,ep053
48,to having a pool it's such a big part of,ep053
51,our lives after five years in southern,ep053
54,France I'm not sure if it's the right,ep053
57,climate while Alphonse is prioritizing,ep053
60,space and price the price is a beat over,ep053
63,your budgets over perms and again I,ep053
66,don't think about,ep053
69,[Music],ep053
72,I'm looking forward to reconnecting with,ep053
75,my good friends my family,ep053
78,I'm originally from Vancouver Canada my,ep053
81,parents are Hungarian and they emigrated,ep053
84,to Canada before I was born I was born,ep053
87,and raised in Budapest Hungary I moved,ep053
90,to Canada at a young age now we are here,ep053
93,in France we have two children Daniel,ep053
96,and Angelina originally we want to move,ep053
99,to Budapest Hungary straight away except,ep053
102,the economy was terrible and you really,ep053
105,couldn't make a living there and tourism,ep053
108,at the time but now we feel it's the,ep053
111,time to move back to our roots everybody,ep053
114,I know who is Hungarian descent like us,ep053
117,as buying property going back starting,ep053
120,businesses it feels like the right time,ep053
123,to go back so here we have a B&amp;B and,ep053
126,that developed into hosting children,ep053
129,it's like an immersion program where you,ep053
132,have students live with you and learn,ep053
135,English it's it clears what are the,ep053
138,flavors what their idea is is to take it,ep053
141,to hungry so it's a big step it's a,ep053
144,brand new concept in Hungary the only,ep053
147,thing that we disagree it on is the,ep053
150,swimming pool I'm so used to getting up,ep053
153,in the morning swimming before the,ep053
156,children get up it's such a big part of,ep053
159,my life,ep053
162,Hungary doesn't have a summer season,ep053
165,that's long enough for a swimming pool,ep053
168,and I know what it takes to upkeep a,ep053
171,swimming pool because I'm the one doing,ep053
174,it in France this is our last breakfast,ep053
177,in France so enjoy it savor it so you,ep053
180,can remember,ep053
183,leaving Kappa Stang it's gonna be hard,ep053
186,because we've been living here for five,ep053
189,years we've made a lot of friends moving,ep053
192,to a third country of course it's hard I,ep053
195,mean kids don't know what to expect in,ep053
198,the unknown with Budapest growing,ep053
201,economy and tourism boom there's new,ep053
204,demand for Eva and Alphonsus English,ep053
207,immersion program Budapest has a,ep053
210,beautiful climate beautiful architecture,ep053
213,and many foreigners come here to live,ep053
216,Budapest is a quite a big city with two,ep053
219,million people it is split into two,ep053
222,parts,ep053
225,Ashton Buda first is very attractive,ep053
228,because of the entertainment places and,ep053
231,Buda is it's a more quiet part we need,ep053
234,for minimum four bedrooms right because,ep053
237,we have students coming from France and,ep053
240,Hungary that lived with us what else is,ep053
243,important have a garden and perhaps a,ep053
246,beautiful kitchen I love cooking ok,ep053
249,notine so what else is important I would,ep053
252,love to have a swimming pool I'm not,ep053
255,sure if it's the right climate for a,ep053
258,swimming pool it's location important,ep053
261,for you uh yeah we would like to be,ep053
264,close to an international school because,ep053
267,the children of speak English and French,ep053
270,what is your budget three hundred and,ep053
273,ten thousand US dollars great let's see,ep053
276,what can we do to find such property,ep053
279,that would meet meet all their criteria,ep053
282,they would need to push up their budget,ep053
285,to get everything they want,ep053
288,Laura kicks off the hunt by delivering,ep053
291,on Eva's most difficult request,ep053
294,[Music],ep053
297,in this neighborhood we have nice good,ep053
300,schools a university around five minutes,ep053
303,they can go by themselves this is the,ep053
306,house and we are going to see soon the,ep053
309,property itself has three bedrooms two,ep053
312,bathrooms only three dreams badge s but,ep053
315,has a pool a pool but it's only got,ep053
318,three bedrooms he has three bedrooms and,ep053
321,what's the price of this one the price,ep053
324,325 thousand that's not so bad,ep053
327,well not so bad but it is over our,ep053
330,budget so so let's go in oh no big,ep053
333,living room yeah that's beautiful I like,ep053
336,that nice and open,ep053
339,yeah it's nice I like it that it goes,ep053
342,straight out to the terrace I do like,ep053
345,the open concept what in the world is,ep053
348,that it looks like straight out of the,ep053
351,Flintstones,ep053
354,it's hollow I don't know I can't even,ep053
357,remove it if you don't like yeah okay,ep053
360,and the kitchen it's open,ep053
363,this island I think is more of an,ep053
366,obstacle than anything else,ep053
369,easy access to the dining room and the,ep053
372,living room and the terrace so it could,ep053
375,be a good space but here's the problem,ep053
378,this is already over our budget,ep053
381,if we have to renovate it it's it's,ep053
384,going to be too much here we are and the,ep053
387,bedrooms,ep053
390,this is the master bedroom yes oh it's,ep053
393,red I like red it's my favorite color,ep053
396,it's a big space okay what do you think,ep053
399,what do I think it's a bit oddly shape,ep053
402,from a business standpoint we could put,ep053
405,the kids into one bedroom and have two,ep053
408,students in the other that is still,ep053
411,doable it's not ideal but it is,ep053
414,manageable so here we are in the master,ep053
417,bathroom okay,ep053
420,it's a large space this is nice and,ep053
423,spacious it's big Wow this is my waist,ep053
426,beautiful veranda ahh with a pool it's,ep053
429,nice it's covered it's completely,ep053
432,covered the terrace,ep053
435,well I love the pool I wasn't thinking,ep053
438,about having a pool here but since there,ep053
441,is already one okay it's nice I have to,ep053
444,admit the house is nice problem is that,ep053
447,it's only got three bedrooms it's always,ep053
450,difficult when you're buying a house,ep053
453,when somebody really likes a certain,ep053
456,style or a certain feature but like what,ep053
459,all marriages you have to compromise a,ep053
462,pool is important Eva but a fourth,ep053
465,bedroom is more important than a pool,ep053
468,and also it's over our budget everything,ep053
471,needs some updating,ep053
474,three levels property losses terms huge,ep053
477,Laura provides a bigger home but it's,ep053
480,still not quite cheap enough for,ep053
483,Alphonse just a bit over your budget,ep053
486,"$320,000 without a pool",ep053
489,so this is the say Chaney baths guys,ep053
492,they used to come here as a kid all the,ep053
495,time you guys will love it Eva and,ep053
498,Alphonse successfully set up an English,ep053
501,teaching program back in France and,ep053
504,they'll need lots of space in their new,ep053
507,home in order to expand the business to,ep053
510,Budapest originally we would have loved,ep053
513,to move to Budapest Hungary straight,ep053
516,away except the economy was terrible and,ep053
519,you really couldn't make a living there,ep053
522,and tourism at the time but now is the,ep053
525,time to make a living in the country,ep053
528,that were really from Eva has never,ep053
531,lived in Hungary before so for her it's,ep053
534,gonna be a much bigger change although I,ep053
537,have never lived there as an adult so,ep053
540,it's going to be something interesting,ep053
543,for me as well and Eva's inexperience in,ep053
546,Budapest has led to some unusual,ep053
549,requests I would love to have a swimming,ep053
552,pool this is an exchange of a pool,ep053
555,in the south of France we had a pool,ep053
558,it's fantastic here it's a different,ep053
561,climate but Eva found a lot to like in,ep053
564,house wine even though a three-bedroom,ep053
567,home would put a squeeze on their,ep053
570,business it is still on the list and it,ep053
573,is something that you would consider,ep053
576,with the pool yes from a business,ep053
579,standpoint we could put the kids into,ep053
582,one bedroom and have two students in the,ep053
585,other it's not ideal but it is,ep053
588,manageable for a pool it is definitely,ep053
591,not ideal,ep053
594,I couldn't build one like this at the,ep053
597,house for house to Laura finds a home,ep053
600,that has all the space Alphonse is,ep053
603,looking for but it's outside her clients,ep053
606,price range they chose this property,ep053
609,because it has enough space for the,ep053
612,students and their family business that,ep053
615,they wish to have yeah you can park here,ep053
618,this is a five bedroom property then two,ep053
621,and a half bathrooms okay it's very big,ep053
624,yard too,ep053
627,it's exactly what we wanted but where's,ep053
630,the pool there's no pool but it's quite,ep053
633,close to an international school what's,ep053
636,"the price $320,000 it's three hundred",ep053
639,and twenty thousand without a pool,ep053
642,yes but it's got five bedrooms and,ep053
645,that's the most important thing we might,ep053
648,have to give up the swimming pool for,ep053
651,the fifth bedroom,ep053
654,oh here we are wow this is huge,ep053
657,it's so open but it's very modern which,ep053
660,I like you know that no I'm more,ep053
663,traditional look at the view,ep053
666,oh my goodness you can see all the way,ep053
669,to the mountains on the other side this,ep053
672,is amazing,ep053
675,does this go through to the kitchen yes,ep053
678,a fully equipped kitchen oh this is Maha,ep053
681,perfect it's beautiful,ep053
684,look at the countertops brand-new yeah,ep053
687,the only thing is it's not an open plan,ep053
690,I know it's a funny shape too it's like,ep053
693,a triangle hey I don't know if I like,ep053
696,that so much I think the kitchen is,ep053
699,beautiful I love all the big windows,ep053
702,it's nice new fresh it's great four,ep053
705,bedrooms there's lots of stairs here we,ep053
708,are in the master bedroom this is great,ep053
711,space look at the whew so bright,ep053
714,beautiful that's beautiful,ep053
717,you have your own balcony gorgeous love,ep053
720,it this is great space,ep053
723,beautiful yes titles what do you think,ep053
726,this is nice this is really nice see the,ep053
729,next bedroom ooh I like this oh this is,ep053
732,great this is great for one of the,ep053
735,children yeah this would be one of the,ep053
738,kids rooms and all bedrooms are similar,ep053
741,size well this is a nice size this is,ep053
744,perfect for a neutral child,ep053
747,oh look at that it's got its own Terrace,ep053
750,as well Wow beautiful but where are we,ep053
753,gonna put the students well there's a,ep053
756,spacious bedroom downstairs so I believe,ep053
759,this room could work for your family,ep053
762,business,ep053
765,it is nice and big it's a very big room,ep053
768,which would give us enough room to,ep053
771,convert it into a study room as well Wow,ep053
774,I found it a bit dark so do you like,ep053
777,this place it's a nice house it's got a,ep053
780,nice big yard which I love but there's,ep053
783,still no pool that's a problem for me,ep053
786,and it is of a hard budget and this will,ep053
789,be the property are going to see is,ep053
792,beautiful,ep053
795,very nice house yes we have a big big,ep053
798,yard here in the back that'll be perfect,ep053
801,for the kids but no swimming pool these,ep053
804,are called chimney cakes and you have,ep053
807,different flavors you each get one,ep053
810,cinnamon cocoa after successfully,ep053
813,starting an English immersion program in,ep053
816,France even alphonse are bringing their,ep053
819,family and their new business back to,ep053
822,Alphonsus homeland I was born and raised,ep053
825,in Budapest Hungary in the last five,ep053
828,years,ep053
831,Hungary economically has changed huge,ep053
834,tourism in Budapest has quadrupled,ep053
837,but since Alphonse has a bit more,ep053
840,practical experience when it comes to,ep053
843,living in Hungary this is a surprise,ep053
846,he and Eva have different ideas about,ep053
849,what their new life will be like,ep053
852,Hungary's summers are not long enough to,ep053
855,have a swimming pool and I disagree I,ep053
858,think that hungry has the perfect length,ep053
861,of time to have a swimming pool I'll,ep053
864,meet you in the middle and get your,ep053
867,jacuzzi but house wine had just what he,ep053
870,was looking for I'm so used to having a,ep053
873,pool after five years and southern,ep053
876,France I will get my pool don't think,ep053
879,about the house is nice I like the,ep053
882,outside a lot the problem is that it's,ep053
885,only got three bedrooms pool is,ep053
888,important to Eva but fourth bedroom is,ep053
891,more important than a pool house to has,ep053
894,more space for Alphonse,ep053
897,so open but it's very modern it's a,ep053
900,really big house it's gorgeous I really,ep053
903,love it but the over budget price tag,ep053
906,would put a strain on their developing,ep053
909,"business $320,000 you don't seem to be",ep053
912,happy you can't overlook the fact that,ep053
915,it's it's way out of our price range and,ep053
918,I still want a pool,ep053
921,for house three Laura knows her marching,ep053
924,orders are clear stay within the budget,ep053
927,these properties under their budget has,ep053
930,four bedrooms two bathrooms and it's a,ep053
933,really a lovely neighborhood that double,ep053
936,car garage look that's a big garage love,ep053
939,it,ep053
942,beautiful okay very nice we have four,ep053
945,bedrooms huh and two bathrooms but no,ep053
948,swimming pool okay,ep053
951,what's the price then it's under your,ep053
954,budget three hundred thousand US dollars,ep053
957,Oh under budget yeah finally great under,ep053
960,budget that means we can build a pool,ep053
963,hmm,ep053
966,we'll see so here we are in the living,ep053
969,room oh wow oh this is completely open,ep053
972,it's very nice indeed,ep053
975,I don't think there's anything I don't,ep053
978,like very bright in here isn't it with,ep053
981,all these windows that's very nice oh,ep053
984,and the kitchen big kitchen look at this,ep053
987,I mean it's fully equipped does it come,ep053
990,with everything yes sure that's,ep053
993,fantastic love the open concept I think,ep053
996,this is great well there is no swimming,ep053
999,pool but there's a sound ISTEP sauna,ep053
1002,oh that's more for the climate in,ep053
1005,Hungary so here is one box,ep053
1008,oh this is nice yeah nice shower too,ep053
1011,oh wow this is great,ep053
1014,gorgeous well it's not a pool but it's,ep053
1017,better than a pool for hungry I think we,ep053
1020,can convince her over the pool because,ep053
1023,the house has a sauna which I think she,ep053
1026,will find a lot more useful and in,ep053
1029,hungry than a pool so we have four,ep053
1032,bedrooms upstairs let's see first the,ep053
1035,master bedroom okay my first impression,ep053
1038,is actually it's too small it's a nice,ep053
1041,view of the yard,ep053
1044,that's great,ep053
1047,okay things a bit bigger yeah yes it's,ep053
1050,plenty big enough for two separate beds,ep053
1053,and even our desk yeah mm-hmm let me,ep053
1056,show you the a big Terrace here Wow look,ep053
1059,at the yard it's gorgeous,ep053
1062,definitely enough place for a pool it is,ep053
1065,under budget it is they do you never,ep053
1068,know well I am blown away by the,ep053
1071,property I think it's beautiful,ep053
1074,the only negative really is the size of,ep053
1077,the master bedroom it's move-in ready,ep053
1080,and the location is lovely yes now tell,ep053
1083,me are there any schools nearby yes of,ep053
1086,course there are international schools,ep053
1089,around however it is about 30 minutes,ep053
1092,drive I think that's a bit far the,ep053
1095,biggest issues with the property it's,ep053
1098,far from the city and it's far from the,ep053
1101,school and to have to drive the kids in,ep053
1104,every day that's two hours out of our,ep053
1107,day I could see that being a problem can,ep053
1110,even make a convincing case for the,ep053
1113,house with the pool such a great feature,ep053
1116,to be close to everything in the,ep053
1119,downtown core to have a pool to have,ep053
1122,students it's only got three bedrooms so,ep053
1125,I can see that one working,ep053
1128,so what do you think of living here guys,ep053
1131,Eva and Alphonse have left France to,ep053
1134,return to their roots in Hungary and,ep053
1137,expand their family business it's gonna,ep053
1140,be a tough decision it will be a very,ep053
1143,tough decision they'll need a place big,ep053
1146,enough for their family and their,ep053
1149,students and space cost money so,ep053
1152,budget-conscious,ep053
1155,Alphonse is not thrilled about Eva's,ep053
1158,expensive request for a pool a pool,ep053
1161,house a house with a pool okay what's,ep053
1164,the positive the pool I'm so used to,ep053
1167,having a pool after five years in,ep053
1170,southern France I don't know if I'm,ep053
1173,willing to give it up it is quite a bit,ep053
1176,over budget the house is nice I like the,ep053
1179,outside a lot the problem is that it's,ep053
1182,only got three bedrooms a pool is,ep053
1185,important to Eva but I think she would,ep053
1188,agree with me that a fourth bedroom is,ep053
1191,more important than a pool what about,ep053
1194,the balcony house I quite like that,ep053
1197,house it's big it's got five bedrooms so,ep053
1200,from the business point of view it's,ep053
1203,fantastic it's very modern it is,ep053
1206,it's a really big help it's so beautiful,ep053
1209,I really love it but it doesn't have a,ep053
1212,pool and it's also very modern it's it's,ep053
1215,enormous,ep053
1218,"I don't know if I'd want 3,000",ep053
1221,square-foot house but has no pool and,ep053
1224,it's over budget what about the,ep053
1227,Mediterranean style house it is under,ep053
1230,budget under budget enough to build a,ep053
1233,pool perhaps yes greens pretty big,ep053
1236,that's definitely enough place for a,ep053
1239,pool it is under budget it could be a,ep053
1242,possibility we could make it happen but,ep053
1245,for the moment we have a sauna which is,ep053
1248,much more suitable for the climate in,ep053
1251,Hungary and what about the bedrooms,ep053
1254,upstairs to our good sized and to,ep053
1257,Burgess okay sighs my first impression,ep053
1260,is that it's small you're right,ep053
1263,are the other ones bigger perhaps no,ep053
1266,they are similar size so they're all,ep053
1269,small bedrooms yes the master bedroom is,ep053
1272,a bit small she's right but I think it's,ep053
1275,a small sacrifice we have to make for,ep053
1278,the students in the bigger room,ep053
1281,[Music],ep053
1284,I think the pool host will have to be,ep053
1287,off the list it just doesn't make sense,ep053
1290,to go over-budget for a pool when we,ep053
1293,don't have enough rooms so the pool,ep053
1296,house is definitely off the less than so,ep053
1299,between the house with the balconies and,ep053
1302,the classic style Mediterranean style,ep053
1305,house which one would you pick,ep053
1308,well I think I like the traditional,ep053
1311,house because the layout of the house is,ep053
1314,to my liking I think it's perfect it is,ep053
1317,far from the city and the schools though,ep053
1320,but the house with the balconies the,ep053
1323,location is fantastic there's a train,ep053
1326,going to the city the school is only,ep053
1329,five minutes away for the perfect house,ep053
1332,I think it's worth an extra 20-minute,ep053
1335,Drive per day and it is under budget,ep053
1338,although it's under budget it's only got,ep053
1341,four bedrooms where the other one is,ep053
1344,just a little bit over budget it's got,ep053
1347,the fifth bedroom so from the business,ep053
1350,point of view it's a great house well,ep053
1353,for the business perspective I have to,ep053
1356,agree and if I can have a pool in the,ep053
1359,future than I say yes it's the balcony,ep053
1362,house yes,ep053
1365,I feel like we're we're finally come,ep053
1368,home,ep053
1371,it's fantastic isn't it,ep053
1374,we're very happy here we love it here,ep053
1377,enjoy mine we both love our new life,ep053
1380,here that was a good one Daniel I am,ep053
1383,disappointed that we don't have a pool,ep053
1386,yet I do understand that from a business,ep053
1389,standpoint this is the best choice for,ep053
1392,us we're only a few weeks in and we're,ep053
1395,already half full for our summer program,ep053
1398,which is great I am running so it's I am,ep053
1401,actually running I'm actually running,ep053
1404,while I'm saying so we were uncertain of,ep053
1407,how the business would go but it seems,ep053
1410,like that we're doing okay because we,ep053
1413,have a lot of customers coming in the,ep053
1416,extra bedroom actually worked out,ep053
1419,perfectly for our home-based business,ep053
1422,good job for us adjusting to show Emma,ep053
1425,it was a lot easier than when we moved,ep053
1428,to France because here we speak the,ep053
1431,language we have friends family so it,ep053
1434,was really easy to assimilate into the,ep053
1437,village we just took a five year detour,ep053
1440,we just took the long way home,ep053
12,[Music],ep054
15,have you noticed that all these houses,ep054
18,have amazing wooden shutters I know Luke,ep054
21,and Aaron have moved to northern Italy's,ep054
24,wine country I love that sound that's,ep054
27,the best in the world didn't your torn,ep054
30,Middle East and the payoff was militares,ep054
33,gonna send me to Europe to finish out my,ep054
36,career there's a cafe on the corner up,ep054
39,and check it out it's our chance to,ep054
42,travel as a family raise our glasses,ep054
45,chin chin chin chin she wants to live an,ep054
48,Italian dream when we open the shutters,ep054
51,I can actually see flowers out there,ep054
54,yeah I wanted walk around at a,ep054
57,restaurant and then you know visit all,ep054
60,the shops afterwards and be in the,ep054
63,hustle and bustle of what's going on but,ep054
66,Luke here's nature calling I like I can,ep054
69,see that mountains here it's better than,ep054
72,city centre is you just have to accept,ep054
75,the fact that this is the place we,ep054
78,should be and need to be,ep054
81,[Music],ep054
84,can't believe we're finally here anybody,ep054
87,got that back we met at a restaurant,ep054
90,Aaron is probably the one and only girl,ep054
93,I've ever had the courage to go up past,ep054
96,the phone number and worked out they,ep054
99,married and started a family in Biloxi,ep054
102,Mississippi,ep054
105,but now adventure calls I haven't ever,ep054
108,been to Europe so this is gonna be a,ep054
111,first-time thing for me which I gotta,ep054
114,decide and I just can't wait to see,ep054
117,everything that I don't know I don't,ep054
120,know what I don't know right now I think,ep054
123,this is our room you in the middle I,ep054
126,don't know how you gonna get in there,ep054
129,they begin their hunt with opposite,ep054
132,priorities Luke wants rustic mountains,ep054
135,but Aaron I grew up in the country being,ep054
138,secluded so I want to be in the hustle,ep054
141,and bustle of everyday attetion life,ep054
144,that's what I envision oh boy,ep054
147,I know right very excited but there's,ep054
150,also some nervousness we're going from a,ep054
153,two-income family to a one-income family,ep054
156,and it's just gonna be the three of us,ep054
159,kind of against the world for a while,ep054
162,"settled around 2,000 BC the province",ep054
165,sits south of the Venetian Alps today,ep054
168,Pordenone province is home to the US air,ep054
171,base in Aviano while charming locals and,ep054
174,tourists alike with its unparalleled,ep054
177,historical architecture for ánotá is a,ep054
180,fantastic place we're 40 minutes from,ep054
183,the beaches we are 20 minutes from the,ep054
186,mountains so there are excellent,ep054
189,opportunities for them to see beautiful,ep054
192,places but also do things and be a part,ep054
195,of the real life here what brings it is,ep054
198,to Italy I'm assigned to the base in,ep054
201,Aviano so you need something which is,ep054
204,kind of close to the base no 115 minutes,ep054
207,house wise what kind of a house are we,ep054
210,looking for what's important to you,ep054
213,three to four bedrooms okay just for,ep054
216,family and guests to come and visit two,ep054
219,bathrooms okay that's a really big thing,ep054
222,for us storage space just a difficulty,ep054
225,with finding closet space in Europe what,ep054
228,budget are we looking at we're here to,ep054
231,"travel and anything we go over $1,400 a",ep054
234,month will take away from our travel,ep054
237,expenses when do you prefer the center,ep054
240,like I'm put a no-no what ya think is,ep054
243,going on,ep054
246,would you like to be like greenery in,ep054
249,nature and I want the base of the dolma,ep054
252,so you're like typical husband-and-wife,ep054
255,you want to write Aaron would love to,ep054
258,have the birds tweeting in the morning,ep054
261,you know and be able to walk to the,ep054
264,little market and buy her food I have a,ep054
267,few ideas why don't we start immediately,ep054
270,perfect thank you however loves nature,ep054
273,with the mountains so the biggest,ep054
276,challenge will probably get the two of,ep054
279,them to be happy,ep054
282,for house one Sabina follows Aaron's,ep054
285,request with a Piazza house in the,ep054
288,center of valve a sony middle of,ep054
291,how far are we from the base right now,ep054
294,half an hour out that's a long drive,ep054
297,consider well here we are this is a,ep054
300,house from the 1300s and this is what I,ep054
303,call the Piazza House because you're,ep054
306,right in the Piazza right in the center,ep054
309,town love it this is exactly what I had,ep054
312,pictured from I said I want something in,ep054
315,a village you squawk out her front door,ep054
318,and we're right where we want to be I,ep054
321,don't see any mountains the Piazza house,ep054
324,has great curb appeal I would just love,ep054
327,walking up to that house every single,ep054
330,day and thinking oh we get to live here,ep054
333,I disagree I think we're tucked in,ep054
336,behind a church and other buildings and,ep054
339,I can't see a freaking Mountain anywhere,ep054
342,the bells will sound great though we're,ep054
345,looking at three bedrooms and two,ep054
348,bathrooms yes and good thing Luke,ep054
351,"listing price is 1,300 dollars per month",ep054
354,so we are $100 under budget Oh awesome,ep054
357,perfect yeah well let's go take a look,ep054
360,at it I think we can make this work okay,ep054
363,well here we are this is the dining room,ep054
366,I love the floors yes they're all the,ep054
369,original flooring Wow throughout the,ep054
372,whole house sell house okay in fact even,ep054
375,here they brought out the old original,ep054
378,rocks from the 1300s in this house was,ep054
381,built I feel like I'm in Italy when we,ep054
384,open the shutters I can actually see,ep054
387,flowers out there I feel like I'm stuck,ep054
390,back in time it might be too much of a,ep054
393,project what's really great about this,ep054
396,room though is like you have the dining,ep054
399,room which leads directly into the,ep054
402,kitchen mm-hmm oh my yeah it's not quite,ep054
405,as big as probably what you're used to a,ep054
408,little bit smaller like a play kitchen,ep054
411,I'm in a little shocked about the size,ep054
414,of the kitchen this is typical European,ep054
417,living and so what you wanted this is,ep054
420,what you get it's very small and cute,ep054
423,but I'm just very much of the Italian,ep054
426,dream right now and I I really have to,ep054
429,think about function and how this is,ep054
432,going to work I love that Erinn saw the,ep054
435,small kitchen because this is what I've,ep054
438,been trying to tell her all along,ep054
441,European living is not the same as,ep054
444,American living,ep054
447,here's a bathroom here okay we have one,ep054
450,bedroom - better was perfect okay and,ep054
453,this is the master bedroom,ep054
456,wow you have your own bathroom in here,ep054
459,awesome who has all the essentials you,ep054
462,can look right out at the Piazza yes Oh,ep054
465,upstairs and I still don't see it's,ep054
468,somewhere behind church-bells it feels,ep054
471,almost like a movie set being in the,ep054
474,house but he's not gonna back down so,ep054
477,maybe if I keep giving them wine then,ep054
480,he'll start softening on those decisions,ep054
483,a little bit look well practically where,ep054
486,we're gonna put all of our stuff our,ep054
489,clothes our furniture our TV the,ep054
492,dressers that we're going to bring in,ep054
495,because there's no closet space I didn't,ep054
498,think about storage or where my clothes,ep054
501,are gonna go I just thought about Oh a,ep054
504,great Italian I love my wife I want to,ep054
507,make her happy I know there's a price to,ep054
510,pay if I don't but I want to be smart,ep054
513,about this well out here we have this,ep054
516,beautiful Terrace Wow all of it goes,ep054
519,with the house,ep054
522,these are all grapevines so in the,ep054
525,summer of course you'll have your shaded,ep054
528,area and then this is your outdoor space,ep054
531,okay a little separate dining room yeah,ep054
534,absolutely this is amazing yeah we'd,ep054
537,have been out here I think this would be,ep054
540,kind of where we come to relax at the,ep054
543,end of the day all in all houses house,ep054
546,turning out for you I love it,ep054
549,I'm just blown away I can't even find,ep054
552,the words to explain how fantastic I,ep054
555,think this is this is a very Italian,ep054
558,expectation I had just rolled into one,ep054
561,I'm just a little apprehensive of how to,ep054
564,make the kitchen work for me and the,ep054
567,master bedroom and the storage issues,ep054
570,but I'm open to trying out sighs a huge,ep054
573,selling point but it's not the mountain,ep054
576,view I asked for blush is difficult for,ep054
579,me to get over and the fact that it's 30,ep054
582,minutes from the base that's a hour,ep054
585,commute each day I want to give the,ep054
588,Piazza house a chance I want you to give,ep054
591,it a chance,ep054
594,I'm sure you could find a way to cut,ep054
597,that commute down to 20 minutes and you,ep054
600,know I can see us living there yeah,ep054
603,check this out we call this the Alpine,ep054
606,house for very obvious reasons maybe we,ep054
609,just need to take a little retreat for,ep054
612,the weekend up there and,ep054
615,I can continue looking at houses Luke,ep054
618,has his mountains where's my town over,ep054
621,30 different types of grapes grow in,ep054
624,Italy's Pordenone region which is well,ep054
627,known for its variety of wine offerings,ep054
630,looking forward to this it'll be nice to,ep054
633,take a break from the stress of house,ep054
636,hunting and taste some wines and after,ep054
639,being transferred here by the military,ep054
642,Luke and Erin are eager to explore the,ep054
645,region's wine culture it is pretty much,ep054
648,the wine capital of Italy you can't,ep054
651,throw a rock without hitting a winery so,ep054
654,very excited about that what we're gonna,ep054
657,try this real quick,ep054
660,I love that sound that's the best job or,ep054
663,that sound although both are excited to,ep054
666,settle into an Italian lifestyle she's,ep054
669,mine they can't quite agree on what that,ep054
672,entails,ep054
675,I want that Alpine Bavarian kind of feel,ep054
678,somewhere near the dolomite mountain,ep054
681,range I grew up in the country being,ep054
684,secluded so I want to be in the hustle,ep054
687,and bustle of everyday Italian life,ep054
690,you're like typical husband and wife you,ep054
693,want two things for house one Sabina,ep054
696,showed them Aran city centre Italian,ep054
699,dream involve us owning this is a very,ep054
702,Italian expectation I had just rolled,ep054
705,into one but despite a magnificent,ep054
708,outdoor space the house was missing,ep054
711,Luke's number-one priority I don't see,ep054
714,any mountains and that's 30 minutes from,ep054
717,the base that's a hour commute each day,ep054
720,so for house to Sabinas taking them,ep054
723,closer to Luke's work and his desired,ep054
726,mountains in Aviano like back to the,ep054
729,mountains here yeah it's pretty cool,ep054
732,better than city centers so I just know,ep054
735,you're going to love this place Wow,ep054
738,ciarán look at this,ep054
741,it's nice we'll see we call this the,ep054
744,Alpine house for very obvious reasons so,ep054
747,who has those mountains where's my town,ep054
750,you are a little bit further out here,ep054
753,Erin so about 15 minutes in on a bike,ep054
756,with the car five three bedrooms two,ep054
759,bathrooms and it's only eight minutes,ep054
762,from the base loop one little thing we,ep054
765,are slightly over budget here we're at,ep054
768,"$1,500 a month got pay for a mountain",ep054
771,view may be worth it eight minutes from,ep054
774,the base the mountain view which is a,ep054
777,number one priority for me but it is a,ep054
780,hundred dollars over budget every month,ep054
783,and we have two times that by 12 that's,ep054
786,gonna be problematic how about we go,ep054
789,take a look sure let's right here is the,ep054
792,kitchen Wow this is an American sized,ep054
795,kitchen this is definitely much yes,ep054
798,plenty of storage first off yeah I am,ep054
801,blown away by how much cabinet space so,ep054
804,it's here and space in general in the,ep054
807,kitchen so I'm very excited about that,ep054
810,we're modernized it has everything we,ep054
813,need is more practical I love the idea,ep054
816,of having American touches in the home,ep054
819,it's gonna make things a lot more,ep054
822,convenient for us but I also don't want,ep054
825,to wake up feeling like I'm in an,ep054
828,American home and I'm not really living,ep054
831,in Italy what's nice about this is you,ep054
834,have the dining room right next to the,ep054
837,kitchen which is very convenient space,ep054
840,is a little bit awkward awkward the,ep054
843,space under the stairs it is not even,ep054
846,functional at all you put stuff there,ep054
849,the table goes there we could get a wine,ep054
852,rack and then that whole wall of wine in,ep054
855,here we have the living room very good I,ep054
858,like the size the layouts a little bit,ep054
861,funky,ep054
864,I love the top floors it's just low,ep054
867,maintenance easy to clean a sort of a,ep054
870,shame that the mountains are right,ep054
873,behind us and there's not a window there,ep054
876,there's nothing to see him yeah mm-hmm,ep054
879,now we go up this beautiful staircase,ep054
882,right I do like these stairs,ep054
885,they wonderful it's beautiful I know,ep054
888,this was all done by a local carpenter,ep054
891,Wow all of his own woodwork now down,ep054
894,there we have two bedrooms okay it's not,ep054
897,a bad size at all then we have a,ep054
900,bathroom wow this is plenty of room yeah,ep054
903,this is a really big bathroom I wasn't,ep054
906,expecting this,ep054
909,and we'll head on to the master bedroom,ep054
912,okay gonna like this this is huge for a,ep054
915,nice Wow lots of natural light the deep,ep054
918,window sills I think are fantastic since,ep054
921,we are over budget I would have loved to,ep054
924,have it ensuite and I think you're too,ep054
927,picky and I don't think the bathroom is,ep054
930,that big of a deal one bathroom per,ep054
933,floor is the norm and the fact that we,ep054
936,have two bathrooms meets our once,ep054
939,attorney now what can we see from the,ep054
942,deck outside mountains Wow not only do,ep054
945,you see your yard from here mm-hmm,ep054
948,but Luke I see mountains mountain it's,ep054
951,beautiful yes we look outside and there,ep054
954,is the base of the Dolomites yeah Pyong,ep054
957,Cavallo and looking at those mountains,ep054
960,and just being close to them you can't,ep054
963,get any better than in the Alpine house,ep054
966,well we've seen just about everything,ep054
969,now what do you guys think of the Alpine,ep054
972,house I love it it has everything I'm,ep054
975,looking for in a house to commute eight,ep054
978,minutes to work it doesn't get any,ep054
981,better than that,ep054
984,for me and the mountain view is a huge,ep054
987,selling point for me as well Luke is,ep054
990,obsessed with the mountains maybe we,ep054
993,just need to take a little retreat for,ep054
996,the weekend up there and that'll fulfill,ep054
999,his Mountain mountainous for right now,ep054
1002,and we can continue looking at houses I,ep054
1005,feel a little bit isolated like we're,ep054
1008,not very close to the town center so,ep054
1011,that is a drawback for me and then not,ep054
1014,having two ensuite that's the drawback,ep054
1017,as well okay Erin does not want to hear,ep054
1020,the truth most of the time and I have to,ep054
1023,be the individual that kind of brings,ep054
1026,her down to reality,ep054
1029,this house is perfect for us it's,ep054
1032,perfect for our son and she doesn't have,ep054
1035,to accept the fact that this is the,ep054
1038,place we should be and need to be this,ep054
1041,is probably what we were thinking about,ep054
1044,Erin,ep054
1047,I think so with your super Italian,ep054
1050,clinical charmhouse so this is perfect I,ep054
1053,can see us living here one setback is,ep054
1056,"that we are talking about $1,800 a month",ep054
1059,hmm the lush foothills of the Dolomites,ep054
1062,- peaceful rivers Italy's Pordenone,ep054
1065,province is an outdoor enthusiasts dream,ep054
1068,oh look how beautiful the lake is well,ep054
1071,the water is crystal clear look at that,ep054
1074,and Aaron Luke and their son Jackson are,ep054
1077,taking a break from their house hunters,ep054
1080,to enjoy one of Florida Nona's most,ep054
1083,popular destinations Lake Bar cheese,ep054
1086,with an eight-year-old son both agree,ep054
1089,they need multiple bedrooms and,ep054
1092,bathrooms for their home to work but,ep054
1095,they don't agree on much else I want,ep054
1098,that Alpine Bavarian kind of feel I grew,ep054
1101,up in the country being secluded and I,ep054
1104,want to be in the hustle and bustle of,ep054
1107,everyday Italian life Aaron loves house,ep054
1110,one it feels almost like a movie set,ep054
1113,everything's beautiful Hugh squawk at,ep054
1116,her front door and we're right where we,ep054
1119,want to be but I don't see any numbers I,ep054
1122,think it's a cave you would go in I,ep054
1125,think we'll fit let's try it why not,ep054
1128,what's the worst that could happen right,ep054
1131,but husband Luke would trade the city,ep054
1134,for a mountain yeah check this out and,ep054
1137,is willing to ditch Aaron's desired,ep054
1140,Italian style you just have to accept,ep054
1143,the fact that this is a place we should,ep054
1146,be and need to be awesome,ep054
1149,beautiful so for house 3 agent Sabina is,ep054
1152,taking them to Fontana fraida for a,ep054
1155,house that brings together both wish,ep054
1158,lists but might tear apart their budget,ep054
1161,you do still have the mountain views,ep054
1164,because we're still like out the,ep054
1167,foothills now,ep054
1170,they have a lot of villas here this is,ep054
1173,the view house Wow,ep054
1176,this is probably what we were thinking,ep054
1179,about Erin yes I think so with your,ep054
1182,super Italian manful charm house a,ep054
1185,mountain view in the background you see,ep054
1188,that it's beautiful I love the porch,ep054
1191,wraps around the house yes there's three,ep054
1194,bedrooms three bathrooms you do see the,ep054
1197,nice wooden beams again a lot of this,ep054
1200,old features I kind of thought this,ep054
1203,would be your Italian home right right,ep054
1206,yes okay one setback is that we are,ep054
1209,"talking about $1,800 a month mm that is",ep054
1212,$400 over but it offers a lot you know,ep054
1215,it's the full-blown Italian home that,ep054
1218,you were looking for Aaron you're only,ep054
1221,15 minutes from the base Luke mountain,ep054
1224,views here are spectacular it's a,ep054
1227,location to the base is just as good as,ep054
1230,Alpine house I think just four hundred,ep054
1233,dollars a month over budget,ep054
1236,that'd be stretching us pretty far go,ep054
1239,take a look all right all right good,ep054
1242,okay,ep054
1245,here we are beautiful this is the,ep054
1248,spacious dining room with views to the,ep054
1251,yard and it's also directly connected to,ep054
1254,the kitchen which is really easy okay,ep054
1257,then they have a sunken living room here,ep054
1260,it's been divided into one areas like,ep054
1263,the sitting reading area the other areas,ep054
1266,where you can gather around the,ep054
1269,fireplace have a drink at night,ep054
1272,it feels very traditional Italian to me,ep054
1275,I love the fireplace I love the built-in,ep054
1278,bookshelves,ep054
1281,yes I like how the dining room flows,ep054
1284,right into the living room it's big,ep054
1287,there's that rustic feel that I'm,ep054
1290,looking for I can see us living here I,ep054
1293,can't wait to show you the kitchen Erin,ep054
1296,because that is very traditional Italian,ep054
1299,nice wood-burning stove nice and a,ep054
1302,modern stove yes I love the tile floors,ep054
1305,easy for upkeep and I love the breakfast,ep054
1308,nook I can really picture Jackson there,ep054
1311,doing his homework while we're in here,ep054
1314,getting things ready for the day or at,ep054
1317,the end of day,ep054
1320,I love the cabinet space I love the,ep054
1323,counter space lots of drawers it's great,ep054
1326,to see what my Italian Dream looks like,ep054
1329,in the flesh this would be the nighttime,ep054
1332,area okay these are all storage wow that,ep054
1335,is fantastic absolutely no lack of space,ep054
1338,here no kidding over there you'll find,ep054
1341,two bedrooms,ep054
1344,yeah that would work and there's a nice,ep054
1347,big bathroom down there this is nice,ep054
1350,yeah and then the best part let me show,ep054
1353,you the master bedroom okay what do you,ep054
1356,think of this space I love it I think,ep054
1359,definitely big enough for all of our,ep054
1362,furniture for everything and what's,ep054
1365,really great you have the ensuite,ep054
1368,bathroom yeah that's nice there's an,ep054
1371,ensuite I love that fact great to have,ep054
1374,an ensuite but this looks like the,ep054
1377,Hulk's bath and green tile green,ep054
1380,everywhere,ep054
1383,oh okay Luke Mountain View's Wow there's,ep054
1386,the Mountain View is miles and miles of,ep054
1389,nothing yeah so this is perfect so what,ep054
1392,do you guys think of a house I love the,ep054
1395,house I think it's great I love the fact,ep054
1398,that we're close to the base it's a very,ep054
1401,short commute,ep054
1404,I'm just really discouraged by $400 over,ep054
1407,budget,ep054
1410,I want it all I want mountain views I,ep054
1413,one big yard,ep054
1416,I want wood beams that rustic feel I,ep054
1419,just don't want to pay for it I love,ep054
1422,this home I think it's the classic,ep054
1425,Italian home definitely answers every,ep054
1428,tick mark that we had Luke is freaking,ep054
1431,out about the price and if I'm honest I,ep054
1434,can't say I blame them but this house,ep054
1437,definitely feels like a home to me their,ep054
1440,visions couldn't be further apart so,ep054
1443,who's going to blink first,ep054
1446,as Luke and Aaron make a decision you,ep054
1449,have to think practical we have to think,ep054
1452,functional,ep054
1455,I'm a little bit thirsty what you got in,ep054
1458,that backpack got water and I have,ep054
1461,Prosecco the perfect drinks to make a,ep054
1464,decision you want to talk about I do,ep054
1467,Aaron Luke and their son will be calling,ep054
1470,the pordenone region in northern Italy,ep054
1473,home if they can ever agree on where,ep054
1476,exactly that home should be located,ep054
1479,I want that Alpine Bavarian kind of feel,ep054
1482,I grew up in the country being secluded,ep054
1485,and I want to be in the hustle and,ep054
1488,bustle of everyday Italian life well,ep054
1491,Prosecco makes deciding on a house,ep054
1494,easier that's true we're looking at,ep054
1497,three bedrooms and two bathrooms that,ep054
1500,was important it's good this is exactly,ep054
1503,what I had pictured from I said I went,ep054
1506,something in a village walking to the,ep054
1509,market would be an everyday occurrence,ep054
1512,so we went in paying gas on two vehicles,ep054
1515,really just one for your commute outside,ep054
1518,is great the inside lacks space and,ep054
1521,maneuverability the Alpine house he had,ep054
1524,a great yard it had a great view the,ep054
1527,mountains it was close to work I think,ep054
1530,there's a lot of functionality in there,ep054
1533,boys,ep054
1536,but I wish it was maybe a little bit,ep054
1539,closer to town Wow there it is,ep054
1542,miles and miles of nothing yes oh this,ep054
1545,is perfect okay Mountain View expensive,ep054
1548,very expensive $400 over budget I don't,ep054
1551,know if we can make that work,ep054
1554,[Music],ep054
1557,they're not your house I don't think the,ep054
1560,view was a 400 our view absolutely maybe,ep054
1563,we take that one off the table let's,ep054
1566,toast on now all right one down and then,ep054
1569,there were two,ep054
1572,Alpine house which is my favorite and,ep054
1575,the piazza house which is my favorite,ep054
1578,the Alpine house okay and there's very,ep054
1581,little Cotton's to be quite honest with,ep054
1584,you it has a great mountain view it's,ep054
1587,close to work that's been updated has a,ep054
1590,great yard there's really not much other,ep054
1593,than some minor inconveniences that's,ep054
1596,true but the piazza house is under,ep054
1599,budget so there's a little extra money,ep054
1602,there every single month that we could,ep054
1605,use you don't get more italians in that,ep054
1608,house I understand what you're saying,ep054
1611,it is the Italian villa in the middle of,ep054
1614,everything hustle and bustle I just,ep054
1617,don't know if the commute is gonna make,ep054
1620,it worth it that's an hour commute you,ep054
1623,have to think practical we have to think,ep054
1626,functional Alpine house it's not too far,ep054
1629,from various city centers it's an easy,ep054
1632,drive you could check out different,ep054
1635,markets true I can't believe I'm saying,ep054
1638,this but I think it should be the Alpine,ep054
1641,house I'm just gonna shut up accept that,ep054
1644,victory there you go shintani is why I,ep054
1647,don't like to do this it worked out well,ep054
1650,we're enjoying it loving the traveling,ep054
1653,we're making there's a lot of memories I,ep054
1656,bring you some good prosciutto from,ep054
1659,Aviano some local cheese you can take a,ep054
1662,step back and then say once a lifetime,ep054
1665,opportunity I thought myself just going,ep054
1668,out reading a book and then just kind of,ep054
1671,staring off at the mountains Danny nice,ep054
1674,pick up my face Jackson's made a lot of,ep054
1677,good friends at school he's having a,ep054
1680,great time the awkward space under the,ep054
1683,stairs is still awkward we have not made,ep054
1686,any rash decisions on what to do with,ep054
1689,that yet we have split Rena l'avenir in,ep054
1692,just a little bit to just have it better,ep054
1695,function for us the location of this,ep054
1698,house has been more than I thought it,ep054
1701,would be driving home every day going,ep054
1704,through little winding streets of the,ep054
1707,village to get here every day I pinch,ep054
1710,myself and say I can't believe I live,ep054
1713,here it's it's the Italian dream should,ep054
1716,take you to the Lotteria to get the milk,ep054
1719,out of the vending machine that comes,ep054
1722,straight from the cows you can see them,ep054
1725,right there at the amazing,ep054
1728,I think we live in LA,ep054
1731,I don't know what that means I was a,ep054
1734,good life yes absolutely,ep054
1737,[Music],ep054
1740,you,ep054
12,oh my goodness this is outstanding ray,ep055
15,and Neil are on the hunt for their first,ep055
18,home in Chicago and she wants something,ep055
21,that has old-timey charm you really like,ep055
24,that kind of old Chicago kind of look to,ep055
27,it built in 1906 wow that's old but he,ep055
30,prefers to keep things sleep and modern,ep055
33,it's so modern and so contemporary this,ep055
36,is exactly like the kind of kitchen that,ep055
39,I'm looking for I can't stop looking at,ep055
42,the LED flashing waves then there's the,ep055
45,issue that he wants move-in-ready and,ep055
48,she wants projects definitely need new,ep055
51,countertops and flooring I do think this,ep055
54,would be a big project with all this,ep055
57,tile a lot of big projects in this house,ep055
60,but projects may be the least of their,ep055
63,concerns plenty of seating out here,ep055
66,trained so must go right back there it,ep055
69,looks like it goes right behind the,ep055
72,property,ep055
75,[Music],ep055
78,yeah I'll be 11 like 15 minutes,ep055
81,my name is dipped among it will call me,ep055
84,Neil I'm a graduate student in the,ep055
87,neuroscience program during my PhD my,ep055
90,name is Rhiannon but my middle name is,ep055
93,Ray so I go by that it's a bit easier I,ep055
96,work as a registered nurse and I'm a,ep055
99,nurse manager on a pediatric cardiac,ep055
102,care unit here in Chicago any other,ep055
105,progress on why we first met here in,ep055
108,Chicago about the second weekend I was,ep055
111,here I think so I just moved here from,ep055
114,Arizona and I had a friend here she,ep055
117,asked me to come out on a crazy bar,ep055
120,crawl in Wrigleyville and I was like,ep055
123,sure I don't have anything else going on,ep055
126,a typical Chicago way of meeting people,ep055
129,it was not love at first sight I was a,ep055
132,little hesitant it's a catch but uh just,ep055
135,took me like three months to like him,ep055
138,yeah I just was like I don't know any,ep055
141,friends anyway so it was about yeah and,ep055
144,then I had to deal with that for a year,ep055
147,and then we moved in together after,ep055
150,living together for three years in their,ep055
153,downtown apartment these 20-somethings,ep055
156,are ready to make the leap and buy their,ep055
159,first place,ep055
162,we've been shelling out enough money for,ep055
165,rent that we decided we may as well put,ep055
168,it towards something that we can own and,ep055
171,call some some form of investment yeah,ep055
174,we could maybe catch a ball game,ep055
177,grab some hot dogs so I grew up around,ep055
180,the Chicago suburbs about 30 miles,ep055
183,outside of the city it was awesome,ep055
186,living close to Chicago so it was a good,ep055
189,way to grow up I just love having a lake,ep055
192,so close it's almost like an ocean and I,ep055
195,love the beach as I'm from the west,ep055
198,coast and I'm used to the Sun but even,ep055
201,though they love the Windy City they're,ep055
204,over being right in the thick of it we,ep055
207,currently live right in the heart of,ep055
210,downtown in the Streeterville,ep055
213,neighborhood,ep055
216,right on the Mac mile we're a little,ep055
219,tired of the congestion we're looking,ep055
222,forward to hopefully living somewhere,ep055
225,where there is more of a neighborhood,ep055
228,feel yeah we're looking for more of a a,ep055
231,charming Chicago kind of location and,ep055
234,they both like the quaintness of the,ep055
237,city's north side so that's where they,ep055
240,choose to focus their search,ep055
243,so anything about this neighborhood I,ep055
246,think it's pretty awesome I love the,ep055
249,trees on the street yeah I don't feel,ep055
252,like I'm stepping on a tourist so that's,ep055
255,nice,ep055
258,so my ideal style of home would be to,ep055
261,find a very modern multi-unit building,ep055
264,something that has more of an industrial,ep055
267,feel to it or more of a contemporary,ep055
270,feel overall I tend to disagree I like,ep055
273,something a little bit more homey so I'm,ep055
276,more into like a bungalow style home,ep055
279,here in Chicago I mean if it's not a,ep055
282,single-family bungalow style at least a,ep055
285,building that has some curb appeal with,ep055
288,some like Ivy is like my dream growing,ep055
291,down planters on the front put trim on,ep055
294,the windows you really like that kind of,ep055
297,old Chicago kind of look to it we're,ep055
300,looking for a two-bedroom at least two,ep055
303,bedrooms it'd be nice to have a guest,ep055
306,room and then potentially have room for,ep055
309,an office space as well he'll really,ep055
312,likes the idea of displaying his book,ep055
315,somewhere so I could see why he thinks,ep055
318,an officer's important and helping them,ep055
321,on their hunt is their agent Amy and,ep055
324,what kind of budget are we working with,ep055
327,about 450 to 475 we qualified for a,ep055
330,little bit more but we really want to,ep055
333,keep it under that 475 number we don't,ep055
336,be with any potential work we would have,ep055
339,to do okay well that's a good point what,ep055
342,or how much renovation are you willing,ep055
345,to do so ideally none,ep055
348,I want something turnkey I just want to,ep055
351,move in and get it done so I'm a little,ep055
354,bit more open love to customize it so I,ep055
357,wouldn't mind doing a little bit of work,ep055
360,they agree on an ensuite with dual,ep055
363,vanities a room for a dining table and,ep055
366,Ray really wants a white kitchen wall,ep055
369,neo is primarily focused on its,ep055
372,functionality the kitchen with the big,ep055
375,center island with plenty of prep space,ep055
378,and a guest Oh preferably as I'm doing,ep055
381,this the cooking entertainment space,ep055
384,outdoors would be as there are only so,ep055
387,many months to enjoy outside here in,ep055
390,Chicago I just want to be able to host,ep055
393,some people on a deck of some sort,ep055
396,be in touch soon and we will get this,ep055
399,process started we don't have a tummy,ep055
402,time here so first up they head to,ep055
405,Roscoe village about 20 minutes north of,ep055
408,downtown his neighbor it's really really,ep055
411,nice yeah that's super cute very,ep055
414,charming so this is all right what do,ep055
417,you think very modern I mean I like it I,ep055
420,was hoping for more of a bungalow style,ep055
423,home with a lot more charm maybe some,ep055
426,ivy so we'll have to see what the inside,ep055
429,us offer we have a 2008 condo penthouse,ep055
432,HOAs are only 150 a month and we are,ep055
435,"looking at $500,000 over budget a little",ep055
438,over budget but I think you'll be,ep055
441,pleased all right let's take a look all,ep055
444,right come on inside so right this way,ep055
447,you have a really nice open floor plan,ep055
450,right Oh everything does flow really,ep055
453,nicely two chandeliers interesting but,ep055
456,there's at least kind of seems to be a,ep055
459,separate dining space yes good notice,ep055
462,boys yeah my travels in the kitchen I do,ep055
465,love that the cabinets are awesome I,ep055
468,love this home I love the stainless,ep055
471,steel appliances and the guest oh it's,ep055
474,an awesome but I don't know if this,ep055
477,island is gonna be big enough it looks,ep055
480,like the counter space is a little bit,ep055
483,limited but it definitely would be,ep055
486,workable it's just not as functional as,ep055
489,I was looking for I don't love this,ep055
492,backsplash at all it's something I could,ep055
495,consider doing fixing myself or fixing,ep055
498,in the future we're definitely already,ep055
501,higher than our budget so I don't know,ep055
504,if we're gonna be able to make any fix,ep055
507,ups see it is nice that there's that,ep055
510,desk space over there but I think it'd,ep055
513,be a little limited hopefully there's an,ep055
516,office space that we can find we do have,ep055
519,just two bedrooms here so yeah you might,ep055
522,have to sacrifice but this will come in,ep055
525,here we'll see right this way this is,ep055
528,the spare bedroom this room definitely,ep055
531,is not both big enough for an office and,ep055
534,a bedroom unfortunately I don't think,ep055
537,just having a desk is going to fulfill,ep055
540,our needs it would be nice to have a,ep055
543,designated office space they make their,ep055
546,way down the hall and peek in on a guest,ep055
549,bath before taking a look at the master,ep055
552,suite,ep055
555,[Music],ep055
558,that's really really nice definitely my,ep055
561,face yes I think that's both of our,ep055
564,tastes I think we can both get on board,ep055
567,with that way we do have a double vanity,ep055
570,in your arms our bathroom it's exactly,ep055
573,what we were looking for I'm not sure,ep055
576,how I feel about the tiles or the vanity,ep055
579,or the the look of the bathroom updates,ep055
582,that I wouldn't mind doing once again I,ep055
585,want to move into a place that's already,ep055
588,good and ready,ep055
591,not having to worry about which projects,ep055
594,need to get done it's just unnecessary,ep055
597,stress that I don't think we need to add,ep055
600,to this process they head up another,ep055
603,flight of stairs to a private roof deck,ep055
606,check oh this is amazing,ep055
609,oh my goodness and look at this view the,ep055
612,rooftop deck is amazing that is exactly,ep055
615,the kind of outdoor space that we would,ep055
618,love to have and I could really see us,ep055
621,entertaining in a space like that this,ep055
624,is gonna make her a hell of a summer we,ep055
627,obviously love the rooftop open floor,ep055
630,plan is also excellent the kitchen with,ep055
633,the white cabinets is exactly what I was,ep055
636,looking for it's not having the office,ep055
639,space that I was initially looking for,ep055
642,and it doesn't have that big center,ep055
645,island that I was really looking for in,ep055
648,our kitchen I'd say put unit itself is,ep055
651,worn yellow style very contemporary feel,ep055
654,I love that style you know there's some,ep055
657,nice features that added a little bit of,ep055
660,charm but I was looking for a little bit,ep055
663,older more charming style building the,ep055
666,price is a little bit you know that's,ep055
669,the biggest thing over budget and at,ep055
672,that price I feel like we should be able,ep055
675,to move in well I'm I'm up for doing,ep055
678,projects I just don't know if the budget,ep055
681,will allow us to do the updates that I'd,ep055
684,really want to do to make this my style,ep055
687,sure so Amy lines up a house with Ray in,ep055
690,mind it's so cute I love it I love the,ep055
693,posts and the front porch right there,ep055
696,[Music],ep055
699,there you go I am extremely excited for,ep055
702,this Chicago couple is looking to buy a,ep055
705,first home,ep055
708,that's perfectly made to order so far,ep055
711,they've seen a condo penthouse that has,ep055
714,the contemporary feel Neil wants but,ep055
717,Rhea thought it lacked character priced,ep055
720,"at $500,000 it's over there four hundred",ep055
723,and seventy five thousand dollar max,ep055
726,budget and there wouldn't be any money,ep055
729,left over for projects she'd like to,ep055
732,tackle so their agent lines up something,ep055
735,farther to the north in the Albany Park,ep055
738,neighborhood about 30 minutes from,ep055
741,downtown so cute I love it I love the,ep055
744,posts and the front porch right there,ep055
747,yeah it's definitely much more your,ep055
750,style this house is definitely a pick,ep055
753,for Rhea it's not a bungalow but it's a,ep055
756,craftsman like style it has a lot of the,ep055
759,charming features that she's looking for,ep055
762,Wow,ep055
765,the stairs are really nice all right,ep055
768,it's a really open space yeah call it,ep055
771,open but it's a big space three bedrooms,ep055
774,two and a half baths it's pretty big,ep055
777,yeah built in 1906 Wow that's old and,ep055
780,all for 475 oh okay,ep055
783,senator price range it's on the upper,ep055
786,end of our price range but yeah it's,ep055
789,definitely within our price range that's,ep055
792,nice it's a ton of space the bay window,ep055
795,is beautiful let me show you the dining,ep055
798,room okay nice big space yeah it's,ep055
801,really large,ep055
804,yeah it's a nice space but I wish,ep055
807,everything was open I wish it was open,ep055
810,to the kitchen I wish this wall was gone,ep055
813,and would open up to the living room,ep055
816,might be something we could take down,ep055
819,low then we're out of our budget,ep055
822,if Frey keeps looking for these projects,ep055
825,to find in every house that we look at,ep055
828,then it's going to be difficult for us,ep055
831,to be able to find a place within budget,ep055
834,I love the Big Island,ep055
837,how much counter space actually there's,ep055
840,a ton of prep space in this kitchen,ep055
843,that being said I don't love the,ep055
846,countertops um so we definitely need new,ep055
849,countertops and flooring the cabinets,ep055
852,are great though and the appliances are,ep055
855,all stainless steel you have a gas stove,ep055
858,over here yeah that's awesome I love,ep055
861,that I love the functionality of this,ep055
864,kitchen it'd be perfect if it was,ep055
867,updated but I just don't think in the,ep055
870,budget we'd be able to do the updates,ep055
873,that we'd want to do well these are,ep055
876,minor things you could do in time right,ep055
879,I mean we don't have to do that all,ep055
882,right away but maybe these are the,ep055
885,things we do right away and we save the,ep055
888,other projects for later,ep055
891,what is that that's actually a hot tub,ep055
894,built-in oh that's awesome,ep055
897,but it's kind of in the middle of the,ep055
900,deck which I don't love yeah awkward,ep055
903,spacing but I mean the hot tubs are hot,ep055
906,them so it's a space it's a perfect,ep055
909,space for entertaining your brain so it,ep055
912,must go right back there the charm that,ep055
915,Rey is looking for in Chicago is not the,ep055
918,easiest in their budget so there are,ep055
921,definitely a lot of compromises about,ep055
924,this house the Train is pretty much in,ep055
927,the backyard of this home so if we were,ep055
930,to buy this home we'd have to know that,ep055
933,we're gonna be hearing that train so it,ep055
936,just might be something we'd have to get,ep055
939,used to they head back inside and,ep055
942,upstairs to look in on a guest room bath,ep055
945,and a potential office yeah it's a nice,ep055
948,space for working and there's plenty of,ep055
951,light to come in yeah down the hall is,ep055
954,the master suite,ep055
957,I love these vaulted ceilings a ton of,ep055
960,closet space it's a lot of mirror action,ep055
963,goes on as well we could probably,ep055
966,decrease that a little bit so you could,ep055
969,change those out and then you have an,ep055
972,ensuite bathroom okay Wow a big bathtub,ep055
975,and a lot of brown tile and there's only,ep055
978,in one sink,ep055
981,I'd rather have more counter space than,ep055
984,this giant bathtub I do think this would,ep055
987,be a big project with all this tile yeah,ep055
990,sounds a lot of big projects in this,ep055
993,house I loved that it's a little bit of,ep055
996,an older home and has a lot of charm,ep055
999,ailments they window the stairs the,ep055
1002,hardwoods like there's so much charm in,ep055
1005,it there's a ton of space we love the,ep055
1008,square footage there's a lot of,ep055
1011,retaining and I love that there's for me,ep055
1014,just the right amount of project so I,ep055
1017,could customize the bathroom did have,ep055
1020,that great back deck I was hoping for a,ep055
1023,little more privacy on the outdoor space,ep055
1026,but really pretty great for something in,ep055
1029,the city but I'd love to see someplace,ep055
1032,didn't have quite so many projects okay,ep055
1035,we can do that so they head out to see,ep055
1038,another option well that's pretty great,ep055
1041,it's a brand-new construction thank you,ep055
1044,very much first-time buyers ray and Neil,ep055
1047,are on the hunt for a place in Chicago,ep055
1050,that has the ability to entertain,ep055
1053,outdoors working with a four hundred and,ep055
1056,seventy five thousand dollar max budget,ep055
1059,so far they've seen a condo penthouse,ep055
1062,with a modern vibe for Neil and a,ep055
1065,rooftop deck they loved but it was over,ep055
1068,"budget at $500,000 then they saw a",ep055
1071,single-family Craftsman style home,ep055
1074,priced within budget at four hundred and,ep055
1077,seventy five thousand dollars it too had,ep055
1080,a large deck but a train line runs,ep055
1083,through the backyard and while ray loved,ep055
1086,his old charm Neil thought all the,ep055
1089,needed projects would break the bank so,ep055
1092,today their agent is showing them a,ep055
1095,model home in the Bridgeport,ep055
1098,neighborhood 15 minutes south of the,ep055
1101,city not the north side like they prefer,ep055
1104,the neighborhoods a little bit less,ep055
1107,charming than what both of us are,ep055
1110,looking for it's not that much of a,ep055
1113,neighborhood actual feel it might be an,ep055
1116,up-and-coming part town which is maybe,ep055
1119,but we don't go out around here at all,ep055
1122,that's true so we'd have to commute for,ep055
1125,that yeah well that's pretty great it's,ep055
1128,a brand-new construction I love the,ep055
1131,brick exterior yeah I don't know about,ep055
1134,all the multi colors with the brick but,ep055
1137,[Music],ep055
1140,oh there's some interesting floors,ep055
1143,they're yellow so for bad,ep055
1146,three-and-a-half bath townhome and we're,ep055
1149,looking at the model home today which is,ep055
1152,for sale as is with all of the upgrades,ep055
1155,at 4:52 oh that's great sir I mean are,ep055
1158,all them like finished do we have to get,ep055
1161,the same with upgrades or is that,ep055
1164,customized for this unit there are some,ep055
1167,customizable options if we went for a,ep055
1170,different unit really we don't have to,ep055
1173,have this tile okay right off the bat,ep055
1176,you have a bedroom on the first floor,ep055
1179,all right small but it would work for an,ep055
1182,office space definitely this is perfect,ep055
1185,office space,ep055
1188,I love these industrial accidents,ep055
1191,something not crazy about this it's,ep055
1194,really interesting how they're trying to,ep055
1197,combine the industrial look with the I,ep055
1200,don't know and check out your kitchen I,ep055
1203,can't stop looking at the LED this is,ep055
1206,exactly like the kind of kitchen that,ep055
1209,I'm looking for maybe - the LED lights,ep055
1212,big open island which is perfect my,ep055
1215,cabinets are just what we're looking for,ep055
1218,there's stainless steel appliances guest,ep055
1221,Oh everything's brand-new we don't have,ep055
1224,to do any work to it and then notice -,ep055
1227,you have your space for a formal dining,ep055
1230,all right it's your isolated dining room,ep055
1233,big dining space could fit a bigger,ep055
1236,table in here yeah that's true and then,ep055
1239,notice you have a little outdoor space,ep055
1242,off the kitchen here kind of a smaller,ep055
1245,space the only outdoor space this is the,ep055
1248,only outdoor space a little,ep055
1251,disappointing back inside they make,ep055
1254,their way to the third floor they look,ep055
1257,in on two guest rooms and again,ep055
1260,before heading to the master suite I,ep055
1263,like these floors up here that the wood,ep055
1266,runs throughout the whole top of what it,ep055
1269,would look like if you did the hardwood,ep055
1272,option okay all right so it's pretty big,ep055
1275,yeah it's definitely a great size and,ep055
1278,then you have your ensuite bath okay,ep055
1281,okay I'm not so sure about this vanity,ep055
1284,it's only a single sink it'd be ideal to,ep055
1287,have a double sink but honestly the,ep055
1290,aesthetics of all these features I,ep055
1293,really like them,ep055
1296,yeah but the aesthetics don't make up,ep055
1299,for the fact that there's not two things,ep055
1302,yeah I mean maybe we wouldn't notice it,ep055
1305,as much if we have something they still,ep055
1308,look at I don't know I love the fact,ep055
1311,that it's modern it's brand spankin new,ep055
1314,way too modern for me personally there's,ep055
1317,not really any character or anything,ep055
1320,charming about this place there's some,ep055
1323,definitely some odd features to this,ep055
1326,place that don't have the charm that I'm,ep055
1329,looking for but the best part about this,ep055
1332,place is potentially we could swap out,ep055
1335,some of those aesthetic details that you,ep055
1338,don't like and we wouldn't have to deal,ep055
1341,with a major renovation so that's a,ep055
1344,major positive yeah it did lack the,ep055
1347,outdoor space all that we were looking,ep055
1350,for sure I did like the kitchen though,ep055
1353,the white cabinets were great I loved,ep055
1356,the island and the wood floors upstairs,ep055
1359,too we're also a nice feature that maybe,ep055
1362,we could run those throughout the entire,ep055
1365,unit yeah okay I think this is going to,ep055
1368,be a really tough decision for both of,ep055
1371,us but yeah pull it over a little bit,ep055
1374,and what they'll need to mull over is,ep055
1377,what's most important a large outdoor,ep055
1380,deck for entertaining being in their,ep055
1383,preferred part of town or staying under,ep055
1386,budget even with some renovations I,ep055
1389,think I know it's way,ep055
1392,[Music],ep055
1395,and in some systems yeah it thinks,ep055
1398,that's it this Chicago couple is getting,ep055
1401,ready to buy their first home they've,ep055
1404,seen their options and now it's time to,ep055
1407,decide so what did you think about the,ep055
1410,penthouse condo it was exactly the kind,ep055
1413,of modern style that I was looking for,ep055
1416,it was the modern style you were looking,ep055
1419,for that rooftop was incredibly top was,ep055
1422,incredible however on the inside of the,ep055
1425,house there really was no charm and we,ep055
1428,would need to do some updating and the,ep055
1431,problem with that place that it was,ep055
1434,already wailed and it was only two,ep055
1437,bedrooms so you wouldn't get that office,ep055
1440,that you were looking for well what did,ep055
1443,you think about the single-family,ep055
1446,craftsman,ep055
1449,I loved the single-family Craftsman time,ep055
1452,I was looking for it but it's just so,ep055
1455,many renovations the 475 doesn't even,ep055
1458,adequately measure our budget because,ep055
1461,we'd be tacking on so many projects but,ep055
1464,it did have great bones the perfect size,ep055
1467,with the three bedrooms sure we would,ep055
1470,have space for an actual office that,ep055
1473,didn't have a really nice large outdoor,ep055
1476,space but there's also a train to,ep055
1479,contend with what did you think about,ep055
1482,the ultra-modern townhome it's,ep055
1485,definitely more your safe I love the,ep055
1488,fact that it was a new build it was at,ep055
1491,the bottom end of our budget at 450,ep055
1494,degree and that was with all the,ep055
1497,upgrades already one of the really cool,ep055
1500,things about that place was everything,ep055
1503,was customizable but you still can't add,ep055
1506,that charm to that new of a home and I,ep055
1509,don't think there's much they can do,ep055
1512,about that and it was no outdoor space,ep055
1515,but it was massive I have four bedrooms,ep055
1518,there was plenty of space for guest,ep055
1521,rooms and we would have an isolated,ep055
1524,space for that office I think I know,ep055
1527,which way I'm leaning,ep055
1530,[Music],ep055
1533,so condo penthouse yeah as much as I,ep055
1536,love the single-family craftsman it,ep055
1539,would be a lot of work so I think I'm in,ep055
1542,for the condo penthouse - I just loved,ep055
1545,the outdoor space and it had that small,ep055
1548,desk so if you wanted to use that as an,ep055
1551,office that would be an option let's,ep055
1554,give Amy a call all right left side a,ep055
1557,little bit higher yeah there you go,ep055
1560,it's very exciting being first-time,ep055
1563,homebuyers we learned a lot about the,ep055
1566,process they both had to make some,ep055
1569,compromises let me chose this home you,ep055
1572,know the home was over budget but with,ep055
1575,the help of Amy we were able to get the,ep055
1578,price down to four hundred and ninety,ep055
1581,one thousand dollars I think that you,ep055
1584,know in the long run it's good equity so,ep055
1587,I feel like we were eventually,ep055
1590,comfortable settling at that price even,ep055
1593,though it was a little over budget I,ep055
1596,think the fact that we just loved how,ep055
1599,charming the neighborhood was kind of,ep055
1602,sold us to really great feeling being in,ep055
1605,the neighborhood and I'm excited to,ep055
1608,settle in down here where is haven't you,ep055
1611,seen Karate Kid we decided to take on a,ep055
1614,few projects so one bathroom right now,ep055
1617,is completely torn up the master we're,ep055
1620,gonna do new mirrors and new lighting,ep055
1623,and probably do a shiplap accent wall,ep055
1626,behind the vanity initially I wanted,ep055
1629,something that was relatively turnkey,ep055
1632,ray wanted something that had a little,ep055
1635,bit of projects to work with so this,ep055
1638,place was a pretty good compromise it's,ep055
1641,totally ready to live in and by the time,ep055
1644,that all the projects are done we'll be,ep055
1647,ready to move in what's he doing uh,ep055
1650,making some pocket joints for the table,ep055
1653,grace one of the things we had to,ep055
1656,compromise on this home was that there,ep055
1659,was only two bedrooms and Neal was,ep055
1662,looking for a third bedroom for an,ep055
1665,office but you know this house does have,ep055
1668,the small office space in the living,ep055
1671,area which i think is really perfect,ep055
1674,plus I don't think I'm gonna want to,ep055
1677,leave the rooftop even if I have to,ep055
1680,bring my papers and files up there I,ep055
1683,think that's something that I'd be,ep055
1686,pretty okay with perfect,ep055
1689,[Music],ep055
1692,while we might have agreed about,ep055
1695,everything we wanted we could really,ep055
1698,talk through it and understand the,ep055
1701,others perspective when it comes to the,ep055
1704,decisions that count we have actually,ep055
1707,can do a pretty good job cheers Cheers,ep055
1710,this is nice,ep055
1713,[Music],ep055
12,this cute fireplace cute yes sir,ep056
15,colonial that older style I wanted this,ep056
18,Columbus Ohio couple is on the hunt for,ep056
21,a spacious family house with plenty of,ep056
24,character problem is I do think that I,ep056
27,am very particular what I want it has to,ep056
30,have everything I don't want to settle,ep056
33,either it's been great for Julia yeah I,ep056
36,don't know about that fireplace being in,ep056
39,her room it's just decorative she liked,ep056
42,it to get the upgrades Carolyn wants and,ep056
45,the space Robbie needs something's gotta,ep056
48,give,ep056
51,oh look at the desk it could be your,ep056
54,office no it's a mudroom I don't know if,ep056
57,I want my office to be the same spot,ep056
60,where I'm drying off the dog after it's,ep056
63,been raining the countertops are awful,ep056
66,on the floor needs to be redone I think,ep056
69,I can live with these floors these are,ep056
72,good,ep056
75,[Music],ep056
78,oh my god you want this guy out my name,ep056

105,just likes to have a good time and,ep056
108,doesn't get too stressed a lot I don't,ep056
111,think but what I love most about amis,ep056
114,very hard-working,ep056
117,Carolyn if I could best describe Airy be,ep056
120,caring Carolyn cares so much about those,ep056
123,that are in our life they know what's,ep056
126,happened can that be nice to her today,ep056
129,what was the city's done down here the,ep056
132,riverfront yes it's part it's fantastic,ep056
135,we love living in Columbus Ohio Columbus,ep056
138,Ohio has taken off in the past five,ep056
141,years I'd say it's a big city and yet,ep056
144,it's easy to get around there's a lot of,ep056
147,amazing things there happening almost,ep056
150,every week on whether it's a festival or,ep056
153,some kind of get-together the parks are,ep056
156,great and it's close to our family up in,ep056
159,Toledo coffee yeah that'd be great,ep056
162,we bought this house five years ago just,ep056
165,us two and then once we had Julia we,ep056
168,realized how much things Julia came with,ep056
171,you know swings and toys oh my gosh so,ep056
174,we to see more space you ready get out,ep056
177,of here and have some extra room to get,ep056
180,a larger house with at least three,ep056
183,bedrooms and two baths they're willing,ep056
186,to look outside the city center and,ep056
189,they've targeted the suburbs of,ep056
192,Worthington and Powell suborn Joe's,ep056
195,don't make a mess my biggest challenge,ep056
198,when house-hunting with Carolyn has,ep056
201,really been Carolyn might be trying to,ep056
204,find the perfect home I do think that I,ep056
207,am very particular what I want cuz I,ep056
210,don't want to live in a house for five,ep056
213,years and want to move because it's not,ep056
216,right so it has to have everything and I,ep056
219,don't want to settle either I think,ep056
222,she's gonna be ready to go to one nap I,ep056
225,don't think she's ready for one nap but,ep056
228,my style is more a colonial house brick,ep056
231,exterior than a nice front porch I've,ep056
234,always wanted a front porch I'm really,ep056
237,looking for a traditional style house,ep056
240,something that has a lot of character,ep056
243,for me that's really the Craftsman style,ep056
246,home,ep056
249,Robbie prefers the wood accents and,ep056
252,built-in cabinets found in vintage,ep056
255,craftsmen's I would love a two-story,ep056
258,all the bedrooms upstairs because in,ep056
261,this house our bedroom is actually,ep056
264,upstairs and Julia's downstairs so we,ep056
267,want her closer to us what about this,ep056
270,one,ep056
273,the floors are wood floors was just,ep056
276,awesome that's the page yes and that's,ep056
279,like the kitchen we have now yeah it,ep056
282,doesn't give us that much more space,ep056
285,I would love a big modern updated,ep056
288,kitchen a big island that people can sit,ep056
291,around with barstools and eat dinner at,ep056
294,the island if they want it's got that,ep056
297,open floor plan you like but it might be,ep056
300,too open I don't know if I want the,ep056
303,kitchen right there in the actual family,ep056
306,room I like it though I want to be able,ep056
309,to do dishes and see where Julie is,ep056
312,playing so I would love an open-concept,ep056
315,I still don't mind a room being a room,ep056
318,so I like for the family room in the,ep056
321,kitchen to be able have some flow but at,ep056
324,the same time I wouldn't mind some,ep056
327,privacy yeah we actually had that,ep056
330,meeting booked for next Tuesday,ep056
333,no sorry that's that's Julie in the,ep056
336,background a home office and a fenced,ep056
339,back yard for their dog Leila our top,ep056
342,priorities for Robby,ep056
345,for me having a big basement is just,ep056
348,it's really important and right now we,ep056
351,got a nice bar in our basement which is,ep056
354,awesome for entertaining and having,ep056
357,friends over I would really love a bar,ep056
360,in the next base you don't need a bar I,ep056
363,think I need a bar are you guys another,ep056
366,issue while Carolyn isn't opposed to,ep056
369,minor projects she would rather have an,ep056
372,updated house even if it means they have,ep056
375,"to go over their $400,000 budget our",ep056
378,"budget is 400,000 to go over that at all",ep056
381,I'd actually like to be under it they,ep056
384,have to stand a foreigner though okay,ep056
387,time to find four hundred thousand it is,ep056
390,but I think we can do it,ep056
393,like the street yes good neighborhood,ep056
396,we're in Worthington OHIO which is what,ep056
399,they asked for,ep056
402,I mostly chose this house for Carolina,ep056
405,because it has so much character here,ep056
408,that's colonial yeah what I wanted,ep056
411,about the price thing from a craftsman,ep056
414,but like it's not terrible I like the,ep056
417,neighborhood so that's something well,ep056
420,let's go check it out it's like a,ep056
423,certain terrain such a rainy day today,ep056
426,but I think we have a great house we're,ep056
429,"in a 3-bedroom 2bath 1,500 square feet",ep056
432,"and it's 360 for $1,900 it's a good",ep056
435,price cute fireplace q yes very colonial,ep056
438,and that older style I wanted that wall,ep056
441,is awesome the rooms will narrow you're,ep056
444,not kind of furniture in here but,ep056
447,overall it's it's got a good look and,ep056
450,feel to it it's got the character I like,ep056
453,it we have this gorgeous hardwood floors,ep056
456,yeah these are nice originals I bet he's,ep056
459,pretty good condition they pass through,ep056
462,the dining room as they move on to the,ep056
465,mudroom Oh Robbie look at the desk it,ep056
468,could be your office no it's the mudroom,ep056
471,I don't know if I want my office to be,ep056
474,the same spot where I'm drying off the,ep056
477,dog after it's been raining but it's,ep056
480,three bedrooms so you wouldn't get the,ep056
483,office space so I don't know if that,ep056
486,really works for me I think we can make,ep056
489,it work on to the kitchen it's got,ep056
492,beautiful wood cabinets cabinets are,ep056
495,nice this is definitely that colonial,ep056
498,older style kitchen you know it's a,ep056
501,little bit tight though and definitely,ep056
504,closed off it doesn't have that whole,ep056
507,open concept I am really disappointed in,ep056
510,the kitchen I want a big kitchen with,ep056
513,the big island in this kitchen just does,ep056
516,not have it now you want a colonial,ep056
519,character we also have a nice corded,ep056
522,phones when we're taking care of,ep056
525,business you know we would have this,ep056
528,here which would be very important it's,ep056
531,not colonial now we have this wing of,ep056
534,the house this is what we're calling a,ep056
537,wing well it is separate okay and,ep056
540,there's the full bath a little outdated,ep056
543,but it's a full bath yeah these,ep056
546,built-ins this will be for linens and,ep056
549,things right yeah,ep056
552,this is one of the three beds so either,ep056
555,the guestroom would be down here or,ep056
558,Julie will be down here which is not,ep056
561,something I wanted I wanted all bedrooms,ep056
564,upstairs,ep056
567,this could be my office yeah but we want,ep056
570,a guest room for our parents so we need,ep056
573,to have a space for people to stay Ravi,ep056
576,cannot use it as his office space he has,ep056
579,to use a mudroom and just get over it,ep056
582,they head upstairs to look at the master,ep056
585,bedroom has three closets window-seat,ep056
588,well that's cute I like that yeah Julie,ep056
591,I'd be crawling all over that you really,ep056
594,really design it one way though there's,ep056
597,not a lot you can necessarily do with it,ep056
600,let's go see the other bedroom and bath,ep056
603,so this is the only bath up here so no,ep056
606,ensuite bath so I think this would work,ep056
609,for us it's updated yeah it's a good,ep056
612,size yeah a tub and vanity and there's,ep056
615,nice storage there all right and this is,ep056
618,the final bathroom this is even smaller,ep056
621,than the other one yeah it is this would,ep056
624,be Julie yeah so here's the finished,ep056
627,basement I like that it's nice and cozy,ep056
630,down here at the carpet but it might be,ep056
633,too cozy I mean I really like the,ep056
636,fireplace this is pretty nice that's,ep056
639,kind of cool focal point of the room,ep056
642,though the rooms got some character it's,ep056
645,just I don't know if it's really big,ep056
648,enough for everything that we were,ep056
651,looking for that's nice,ep056
654,it's a really good patio oh wow yeah,ep056
657,this is big yeah awesome love this lot,ep056
660,space for Julia to play I love the,ep056
663,backyard but there's definitely some,ep056
666,things I don't love about the house you,ep056
669,know one bedrooms on the bottom floor I,ep056
672,did not want that but I do love the,ep056
675,character in the charm of the house and,ep056
678,it's the colonial that I wanted I mean I,ep056
681,like the price and that basements nice,ep056
684,doesn't quite have that Craftsman style,ep056
687,that I wanted and the lack of an office,ep056
690,for me is gonna be a problem yeah I,ep056
693,think you know I'd like to see something,ep056
696,and has all bedrooms on the top floor,ep056
699,okay,ep056
702,I'd like something a little bit more,ep056
705,that Craftsman style will find it okay,ep056
708,so now their agent has lined up a much,ep056
711,larger home that's over 100 years old I,ep056
714,love this front porch ton of character,ep056
717,good style,ep056
720,[Music],ep056
723,how nice it's gonna be to have a little,ep056
726,bit more space in here and that I'll be,ep056
729,cramped in this kitchen right now,ep056
732,Robbie and Carolyn are upsizing from,ep056
735,their small Columbus Ohio home but they,ep056
738,can't agree on what would work best for,ep056
741,their family,ep056
744,Ravi wants a historic craftsman that's,ep056
747,"below their $400,000 budget so they can",ep056
750,update it but Carolyn would rather spend,ep056
753,more for an upgraded colonial so far,ep056
756,they've seen a Dutch colonial perfect,ep056
759,for Carolyn it was below budget but it,ep056
762,was small and didn't have the craftsman,ep056
765,details Robbie likes to please Robbie,ep056
768,their agent is lined up a house near,ep056
771,downtown Columbus in a neighborhood,ep056
774,known for its historic homes oh look,ep056
777,it's across from a park that's awesome,ep056
780,yeah that is actually really cool pipe,ep056
783,location this is O'Town East the homes,ep056
786,are big built in the late 18-hundreds,ep056
789,tons of character this lends itself more,ep056
792,towards an arts and crafts style home I,ep056
795,love this front porch,ep056
798,yes a ton of character yes yeah this is,ep056
801,really nice the exterior of the house is,ep056
804,very beautiful it's not a colonial but,ep056
807,it's got the great brick exterior this,ep056
810,is a nice door beautiful is cool well,ep056
813,this whole room there's a ton of,ep056
816,"character in this place this is 3,200",ep056
819,square feet it's four bedrooms two and a,ep056
822,"half baths and it's listed for 410,000",ep056
825,okay so it's over budget but a lot of,ep056
828,size that's what I was looking for time,ep056
831,already seeing wallpaper,ep056
834,I don't like wallpaper but I can get,ep056
837,that taken down look at the care to this,ep056
840,house you got great woodwork look at the,ep056
843,beautiful burl wood bookshelf that's I,ep056
846,like that we have this other room here,ep056
849,which is probably a living room it has,ep056
852,this fireplace these beautiful oval,ep056
855,leaded glass windows you don't see a lot,ep056
858,of style like this in homes anymore so,ep056
861,that's pretty cool I just think it's too,ep056
864,separate there's no open flow to this,ep056
867,house yeah you know might not be your,ep056
870,modern open floor plan but this has got,ep056
873,a pretty good flow to it it's got,ep056
876,hardwood floors throughout which are,ep056
879,original yeah they live there pretty,ep056
882,good condition overall right,ep056
885,yeah they look at the dining room and,ep056
888,half bath before moving on to the,ep056
891,kitchen,ep056
894,he's nice it's got the same character to,ep056
897,it I like the updated,ep056
900,appliances which are great great I mean,ep056
903,there's wallpaper again a different,ep056
906,design this time it's not a bad kitchens,ep056
909,good size it's too closed off from,ep056
912,everywhere else in the house I can't see,ep056
915,Julia when she's playing the countertops,ep056
918,are awful and the floor needs to be,ep056
921,redone I think I can live with these,ep056
924,floors these are good I agree,ep056
927,be careful of the step steps a little,ep056
930,dangerous this is a great backyard,ep056
933,though it's nice and fenced in for Leila,ep056
936,it's got a cool design they head down to,ep056
939,the finished basement there's a half,ep056
942,bath yeah that needs some work it's nice,ep056
945,to have it down here though oh I had my,ep056
948,bar in the basement I like it probably,ep056
951,we don't need another bar it's really,ep056
954,dark in here like creepy dark I agree it,ep056
957,needs a little work but I think we could,ep056
960,really turn this into something nice,ep056
963,it's a lot of work I mean the floor the,ep056
966,alien light fixtures behind you it just,ep056
969,needs some touches you're not seeing the,ep056
972,big picture they go upstairs where all,ep056
975,four bedrooms are located ideal for,ep056
978,Carolyn well it's rooms nice this would,ep056
981,be a fantastic office about this room I,ep056
984,love the window seat in there but this,ep056
987,wallpaper is just a huge mess yeah it's,ep056
990,a big room this would be great for Julia,ep056
993,yeah I don't know about that fireplace,ep056
996,being in her room it's just decorative,ep056
999,she would like it put poison and stuff,ep056
1002,storages and then here's the master,ep056
1005,bedroom we couldn't fit a king-sized bed,ep056
1008,in here we might be able to it would,ep056
1011,just be a little snug this is the,ep056
1014,bathroom it's not attached totally oh,ep056
1017,wow look at these floors,ep056
1020,this is updated the first thing you seen,ep056
1023,that's updated you know she likes it Oh,ep056
1026,what is this,ep056
1029,it's pink on pink check this out,ep056
1032,here's another sitting room playroom we,ep056
1035,don't have any wallpaper up here which,ep056
1038,is great so just slap a coat of paint on,ep056
1041,here yeah I wish there were hardwood,ep056
1044,floors well we take out the carpet David,ep056
1047,Jim oh this would be awesome look at,ep056
1050,this room Carolyn this is great this is,ep056
1053,cool there's another updated bathroom oh,ep056
1056,wow yeah I'm really updated that's nice,ep056
1059,it's like its own wing of the house up,ep056
1062,here you know we could turn this into a,ep056
1065,whole master suite I think yeah but what,ep056
1068,about Julia,ep056
1071,you know she's young for the time being,ep056
1074,she could be up here with us and then,ep056
1077,eventually she can take a room,ep056
1080,downstairs so we're just not gonna use,ep056
1083,the whole second floor I think we could,ep056
1086,find,ep056
1089,to make it all work I love this house,ep056
1092,it's a little bit over budget which,ep056
1095,concerns me but you just can't get this,ep056
1098,kind of character in style a lot of,ep056
1101,homes no I do appreciate all the beauty,ep056
1104,in this house,ep056
1107,but this house is too outdated and it's,ep056
1110,closed off from everything I'd like to,ep056
1113,see something that's a little bit more,ep056
1116,open,ep056
1119,you know updated less little paper well,ep056
1122,I love this home to give Carolyn the,ep056
1125,size and upgrades she wants something's,ep056
1128,gotta give more Tudor not a colonial,ep056
1131,[Music],ep056
1134,we think when we get a new house in a,ep056
1137,bigger yard can we get another dog,ep056
1140,maybe but before they can do that,ep056
1143,columbus ohio couple Ravi and Carolyn,ep056
1146,have to agree on what to buy so far,ep056
1149,they've seen a Dutch colonial Carolyn's,ep056
1152,"ideal style it was below their $400,000",ep056
1155,budget but it was a bit small and the,ep056
1158,bedrooms weren't on the same floor then,ep056
1161,they saw an 1890s home with the arts and,ep056
1164,crafts details Robbie likes but it's,ep056
1167,over budget and needs more work than,ep056
1170,Carolyn is willing to take on and,ep056
1173,neither house had an open layout now,ep056
1176,their agents lined up a house in Powell,ep056
1179,one of their target areas with both,ep056
1182,character and updates,ep056
1185,that's pretty it's more of a Tudor not a,ep056
1188,colonial but the brick is nice yeah it's,ep056
1191,not quite a craftsman but I like the,ep056
1194,brick I like that's got a unique style,ep056
1197,to it works really well with the wood,ep056
1200,accents overall good looking house it's,ep056
1203,a four bedroom three and a half bath,ep056
1206,"it's almost 2,600 square feet and it's",ep056
1209,420 thousand the budget is four hundred,ep056
1212,thousand it has a lot of what I think,ep056
1215,you're looking for well it looks good,ep056
1218,from the outside so we'll take a look,ep056
1221,[Music],ep056
1224,she walking to the four-year guys,ep056
1227,beautiful whooping some old crayons yeah,ep056
1230,it's a little tight near but I like the,ep056
1233,hardwood yeah it is beautiful let's peek,ep056
1236,in here this oughta make someone happy I,ep056
1239,like the windows no this would be a,ep056
1242,great office space I like a the formal,ep056
1245,living room this is a nice space nice,ep056
1248,natural light,ep056
1251,I really like the built-ins this is uh,ep056
1254,that kind of Craftsman style that I,ep056
1257,really like they pass through the dining,ep056
1260,room on the way to the kitchens really,ep056
1263,pretty yeah the countertops are nice,ep056
1266,that's not a lot of counter space it's,ep056
1269,good size up I like the island but it's,ep056
1272,not as big as I wanted I wanted,ep056
1275,everybody to kind of you know be able to,ep056
1278,sit around it maybe we could expand it,ep056
1281,"out I don't know if that 420,000 this",ep056
1284,house is already over our budget and,ep056
1287,we're not gonna be able to do anything,ep056
1290,about that island but look at this I,ep056
1293,love how it opens up in those room I,ep056
1296,love the built-ins that fireplace I go,ep056
1299,see stockings and Christmas decorations,ep056
1302,I can see football games this is a,ep056
1305,fantastic room they head upstairs to,ep056
1308,look at the master suite ceilings are,ep056
1311,great really high feels open in here,ep056
1314,yeah I do like the high ceilings seems a,ep056
1317,little tight this way that headboard,ep056
1320,what about the board I like that board,ep056
1323,but I like how it's built in don't I,ep056
1326,look cool yeah I don't unique you know,ep056
1329,how I love unique I think we keep it,ep056
1332,look at this oh wow look at this tub,ep056
1335,I like the tile looks good looks like,ep056
1338,it's in good condition doesn't need too,ep056
1341,much work,ep056
1344,yeah can't lose our pretty big guy let's,ep056
1347,make sure I can fit in here all right,ep056
1350,make it work we're gonna go to this,ep056
1353,attached bedroom why is it - I don't,ep056
1356,know you guys said that the master,ep056
1359,wasn't as big maybe this could be a,ep056
1362,sitting room for the master it's just,ep056
1365,strange to me how it's attached to the,ep056
1368,master I don't like that it's a nice,ep056
1371,updated bath that's pretty good,ep056
1374,hey the tub though that'll be hard with,ep056
1377,kids kind of stinks they look at the two,ep056
1380,other bedrooms before heading to the,ep056
1383,basement we have a full bath here guy,ep056
1386,right,ep056
1389,well those floors are great what about,ep056
1392,this space Wow I like this big space,ep056
1395,I don't see any storage though like in,ep056
1398,the basement era weed I didn't notice it,ep056
1401,up on the top floor either yeah that's,ep056
1404,gonna be a problem back upstairs there's,ep056
1407,a screened-in porch that leads out to,ep056
1410,the backyard this is a great space great,ep056
1413,for entertaining yeah I need a stain or,ep056
1416,a coat of paint but overall it's really,ep056
1419,nice that's the house guys yeah there's,ep056
1422,that play some things I love about it I,ep056
1425,love the four bedrooms upstairs I really,ep056
1428,love this backyard but the kitchen I,ep056
1431,wish we had a bigger island but certain,ep056
1434,about the lack of storage though I,ep056
1437,really loved that we were able to find,ep056
1440,an office that's a great little space I,ep056
1443,think the family rooms nice it's got a,ep056
1446,ton of character those built-ins are,ep056
1449,great and I'm still definitely concerned,ep056
1452,it's still over the budget which is,ep056
1455,something I really don't think we can,ep056
1458,handle but since none of the homes have,ep056
1461,everything they want deciding between,ep056
1464,Robbie and Carolyn's needs won't be easy,ep056
1467,I don't know what we would do Carolyn,ep056
1470,and Robbie have been searching the,ep056
1473,Columbus Ohio area for a family home,ep056
1476,they can grow into now that they've seen,ep056
1479,"a number of places in their $400,000",ep056
1482,price range,ep056
1485,they're ready to make a decision what,ep056
1488,did you think about the Dutch colonial,ep056
1491,that was what 365 yeah I mean it's,ep056
1494,definitely the best price it has a nice,ep056
1497,basement it gave us that extra space,ep056
1500,that we needed yeah it has a lot of,ep056
1503,storage which I think you know is also,ep056
1506,something that we're looking for true,ep056
1509,and had the great backyard yeah but it,ep056
1512,was three bedrooms and one of them was,ep056
1515,downstairs but you know I don't like,ep056
1518,that kitchen was very closed off the,ep056
1521,whole house was pretty small I mean I,ep056
1524,loved this under budget yeah it was the,ep056
1527,tiny side and it didn't have an office,ep056
1530,for Robbie but their second option,ep056
1533,listed for four hundred and ten thousand,ep056
1536,dollars had plenty of space for his,ep056
1539,office house is huge I mean there was a,ep056
1542,lot of room all four bedrooms on one,ep056
1545,floor it had the whole upstairs section,ep056
1548,the third floor I mean is right across,ep056
1551,the street from that park and had that,ep056
1554,beautiful front porch you know was a,ep056
1557,little over budget but I loved the,ep056
1560,character you just don't find houses,ep056
1563,like that with that great trim and the,ep056
1566,woodwork in front all the wallpaper,ep056
1569,Robbie we can't do that and the basement,ep056
1572,was awful the basement was creepy,ep056
1575,that kitchen was bad and heavy no,ep056
1578,open-concept but I'm sure I can make,ep056
1581,some updates and make that a little bit,ep056
1584,more homey over time and then the tutor,ep056
1587,that was 420 I mean it was the highest,ep056
1590,on the budget end which concern me but,ep056
1593,we can move in right away but that pace,ep056
1596,was so nice it really did so much space,ep056
1599,and I had all the bedrooms on the same,ep056
1602,floor you know I think a head under the,ep056
1605,open concept which I like and it had a,ep056
1608,really nice office for me but there was,ep056
1611,also no storage I don't understand how,ep056
1614,that house had no storage yeah I don't,ep056
1617,know what we would do I gotta say that,ep056
1620,house with that great trim in the,ep056
1623,woodwork just needs a little bit of work,ep056
1626,it's not it's more than a little I think,ep056
1629,it'd be nice to move into an updated,ep056
1632,house and enjoy our time with Julia you,ep056
1635,make your point so you're leaning,ep056
1638,towards the Tudor mm-hmm I think we can,ep056
1641,make it work I think it's the one it,ep056
1644,won't require me doing quite as much,ep056
1647,work I want to spend weeks ripping out,ep056
1650,wallpaper so I think we should make the,ep056
1653,Tudor happen awesome,ep056
1656,if I mom will make us a nice little,ep056
1659,cover for it okay I don't know why we're,ep056
1662,making a cover for it if the dog just,ep056
1665,sits on it all day since closing we fit,ep056
1668,on the house about four weeks or so we,ep056
1671,are still moving in you know we don't,ep056
1674,have a lot of things on the walls quite,ep056
1677,yet we still have boxes I need to find,ep056
1680,their homes but it's great I mean we,ep056
1683,have a lot of room here we just feel,ep056
1686,much more open and like we can breathe,ep056
1689,in this house we doing lasagna at night,ep056
1692,yeah Julia's favorite yes,ep056
1695,so they asked me priced best house was,ep056
1698,four hundred twenty thousand we,ep056
1701,negotiated with the sellers and actually,ep056
1704,got it down to four hundred five,ep056
1707,thousand also have Julia's Easter duck,ep056
1710,so give that back to her it doesn't,ep056
1713,belong in the office since we moved in,ep056
1716,we've painted the master bedroom and,ep056
1719,read on the headboard,ep056
1722,I like this one on the left here I,ep056
1725,actually like this one what do you think,ep056
1728,of that no we're looking forward to,ep056
1731,furnishing our main living space to,ep056
1734,family room and do some more wallpaper,ep056
1737,and design all right I got our,ep056
1740,snowboarding stuff here my biggest,ep056
1743,concern with this house was that there,ep056
1746,were no storage on top there's a,ep056
1749,gigantic crawl space in the basement,ep056
1752,toss it up,ep056
1755,this is more house when we were probably,ep056
1758,really needed but we have a house that,ep056
1761,we can grow into as a family and then we,ep056
1764,can see Julia grow up in so when I,ep056
1767,really think about all the experiences,ep056
1770,and memories we're gonna have in this,ep056
1773,home that's what I get most excited,ep056
1776,about the best part is you guys will,ep056
1779,have your own guest room when you guys,ep056
1782,something oh I think we'll stay in this,ep056
1785,house for a long time,ep056
1788,15 years 50 we're not moving in 15 years,ep056
1791,okay how long do you plan on being,ep056
1794,carried out of this house because I,ep056
1797,don't want to have to move again so I,ep056
1800,want to be staying here as long as,ep056
1803,possible,ep056
1806,girl good job,ep056
12,then and Christine are done with DC,ep057
15,I just need to get used to driving on,ep057
18,the left-hand side of the road we are,ep057
21,newlyweds and we wanted to get out of,ep057
24,the rat race in Washington DC Ben was,ep057
27,born down and,ep057
30,and it's been his dream to return home,ep057
33,it's always been in my blood to come,ep057
36,back to Sydney,ep057
39,but for Christine uprooting everything,ep057
42,isn't so easy it's hard to think about,ep057
45,leaving the stability of hind Creek the,ep057
48,unknown so with no jobs one dog and two,ep057
51,suitcases the pressure is on it's kind,ep057
54,of generic for me the location is great,ep057
57,it's terrible,ep057
60,I know Christine really loves that view,ep057
63,but she's definitely gonna have to give,ep057
66,me a lot of love it,ep057
69,[Laughter],ep057
72,[Music],ep057
75,so this is a little bit different than,ep057
78,Washington DC,ep057
81,just a little certainly more people,ep057
84,barefoot and in bathing suits here Ben,ep057
87,and I met about two years ago and when,ep057
90,we met each other we were both very,ep057
93,focused on our careers I was an,ep057
96,accountant and Ben was in sales,ep057
99,shortly after meeting I think we both,ep057
102,had a priority shift I have a really,ep057
105,good feel about it here our relationship,ep057
108,and our quality of life moved right to,ep057
111,the top of the list I gladly take this,ep057
114,over the Beltway in DC any day Hey we,ep057
117,decided to get rid of all of our,ep057
120,possessions and we made our move to,ep057
123,Australia the one other thing we did,ep057
126,bring besides some clothes was our dog,ep057
129,Tallulah Tallulah it's a little daunting,ep057
132,making the move to a country you've,ep057
135,never been to before,ep057
138,[Music],ep057
141,we've been married for only six months,ep057
144,and yet we've taken this huge turn in,ep057
147,our lives so one of my biggest fears,ep057
150,moving Christine across the world to,ep057
153,Australia is that she would regret it I,ep057
156,so hope that she loves the drastic,ep057
159,change in lifestyle just 25 miles north,ep057
162,of bustling Sydney Avalon Beach is a,ep057
165,laid-back suburb that offers surfing,ep057
168,nature and a dose of tranquillity when a,ep057
171,lot of folks come to Sydney they tend to,ep057
174,do the downtown area but if you've just,ep057
177,come about an hour and a half north you,ep057
180,hit this peninsula which is just,ep057
183,gorgeous we fell in love with the,ep057
186,attitude up here the beautiful beaches,ep057
189,and the amazing Heights and bushwalking,ep057
192,that you can do in this area the market,ep057
195,in Avalon is very competitive,ep057
198,we have people moving across the world,ep057
201,through to the northern beaches and,ep057
204,there's not that many houses that comes,ep057
207,up for rent so you really need to grab,ep057
210,it if you find money like so what are,ep057
213,you guys looking for ideally we're,ep057
216,looking for at least two bedrooms and,ep057
219,one full bath yeah I would love to be in,ep057
222,close proximity to the beach absolutely,ep057
225,we're in Australia love to wake up in,ep057
228,the morning be able to take a run go for,ep057
231,a swim I would also love to be close to,ep057
234,the action maybe downtown Avalon with,ep057
237,all it has going on and I'm looking for,ep057
240,something that's unique has a lot of,ep057
243,character and something with the view of,ep057
246,the water it would be great also we have,ep057
249,a dog so we need to find a place that's,ep057
252,dog friendly so what sort of budget do,ep057
255,you look at our budget is mm all right,ep057
258,she wants a lot of character and he,ep057
261,wants to be close to downtown Avalon and,ep057
264,they also want a nice view and to be,ep057
267,close to the beach so my strategy is to,ep057
270,show them a townhouse first which is,ep057
273,under budget it's also the most,ep057
276,practical property it's pretty much,ep057
279,everything they're looking for,ep057
282,excessively that's not a view taking it,ep057
285,to this fine guys because it's really,ep057
288,good value you have three bedrooms one,ep057
291,bathroom and fenced off backyard which,ep057
294,is perfect for a Tallulah yes great and,ep057
297,how close to the beaches you're about,ep057
300,the three minute walk to the beach five,ep057
303,six minute walk to downtown Avalon Wow,ep057
306,"and it's $1,800 a month so it's under",ep057
309,budget one day yes wonderful,ep057
312,so here's the living room,ep057
315,lots of natural light but the floor plan,ep057
318,is a little bit closed off I wish it was,ep057
321,more of an open layout I like it though,ep057
324,it's a nice-sized room yeah and the,ep057
327,ceilings seem really tall too which is,ep057
330,good for us since were tall people,ep057
333,because you're so it's off freakishly,ep057
336,I'm learning things about Christine,ep057
339,every day,ep057
342,first bedroom it's on the smaller side,ep057
345,but it's perfect for guests are these,ep057
348,ceilings hiding the food bin yeah we,ep057
351,have a separate toilet and bathroom then,ep057
354,you have a shower and a bathtub yep,ep057
357,really nice like that come into your,ep057
360,master here,ep057
363,it's pretty big but it is missing a,ep057
366,little bit of character and you don't,ep057
369,have much of a view,ep057
372,I think views are nice but for me it's,ep057
375,always what they say location location,ep057
378,location,ep057
381,I think being walking distance to places,ep057
384,is a huge advantage here's the kitchen,ep057
387,it's really big but a little bit,ep057
390,outdated,ep057
393,and I would like it to be open with the,ep057
396,living space as well because we like to,ep057
399,cook a lot and also you know we're,ep057
402,relaxing there it'd be nice to all be,ep057
405,together that's why we're really good to,ep057
408,go out to the backyard from the kitchen,ep057
411,okay yeah let's check that out let's,ep057
414,have a look I love that it's fenced in,ep057
417,Tolu is gonna love this from a,ep057
420,practicality standpoint hit the nail on,ep057
423,the head I mean for two unemployed,ep057
426,people that just moved to Australia it,ep057
429,makes a lot of sense because it's under,ep057
432,budget I love the location close to the,ep057
435,beach and close to downtown Avalon well,ep057
438,seems pretty generic and it's missing a,ep057
441,view it had no wow factor no character,ep057
444,and honestly I kind of don't remember it,ep057
447,but this outdoor space is gonna be tough,ep057
450,to pass on yeah,ep057
453,it's a huge shock to the system right,ep057
456,moving thirteen thousand miles from home,ep057
459,so really hoping that EDA can find a,ep057
462,place that makes Christine really happy,ep057
465,and all the while trying to keep my wish,ep057
468,of being close to the beaches close to,ep057
471,downtown in mind wow this feels amazing,ep057
474,could stare at this all day this Dean is,ep057
477,smitten our legs will definitely get in,ep057
480,shape but we might need to build a slide,ep057
483,bed and then maybe fighting an uphill,ep057
486,battle having to bring Tallulah up every,ep057
489,time she needs a log who do you think,ep057
492,that's gonna rely on me I think that,ep057
495,this million dollar view more than makes,ep057
498,up for it there's no better way to see,ep057
501,the Northern Beaches then by seaplane,ep057
504,newlyweds ban and Christine are moving,ep057
507,to Australia to slow down and start a,ep057
510,life together,ep057
513,well yes originally from Sydney man is,ep057
516,dreamed of returning to his childhood,ep057
519,home I'm your pilot but for Christine,ep057
522,change is harder it's a little daunting,ep057
525,making the move from a country you've,ep057
528,lived your whole life into a country,ep057
531,you've never been to before,ep057
534,[Music],ep057
537,we're only a few months into this thing,ep057
540,they call marriage and so there's,ep057
543,certainly some apprehension there's some,ep057
546,nervousness particularly for my wife,ep057
549,leaving the stability of our jobs and,ep057
552,the incomes that we had was difficult,ep057
555,we're going from very rigorous demanding,ep057
558,rewarding jobs to unemployment and being,ep057
561,on a budget,ep057
564,house 1 is affordable and more it's,ep057
567,"$1,800 a month so it's under budget Wow",ep057
570,and your about the treatment off to the,ep057
573,beach,ep057
576,five six minute walk to downtown Avalon,ep057
579,me location is important that's one of,ep057
582,the reasons we moved to Australia is to,ep057
585,take advantage of the beautiful beaches,ep057
588,here in Sydney area it's definitely very,ep057
591,practical and the ceilings seem really,ep057
594,tall too which is good for us since,ep057
597,we're tall people because you're so tall,ep057
600,okay are these ceilings high enough you,ep057
603,big yeah but it still comes up short you,ep057
606,don't have much of a view it does look a,ep057
609,little dated and it's kind of generic,ep057
612,it's gonna take a little work to,ep057
615,convince Christine that this is the most,ep057
618,practical choice I mean for two,ep057
621,unemployed people that just moved to,ep057
624,Australia it makes a lot of sense old me,ep057
627,obviously I want to keep her happy she's,ep057
630,helping me live out my dream I hope this,ep057
633,next house EDA takes us to has,ep057
636,everything on our wish list I just need,ep057
639,to get used to driving on the left-hand,ep057
642,side of the road my strategy is to show,ep057
645,them a cute house what a beautiful gift,ep057
648,but it's not really that dog friendly so,ep057
651,they'll have to compromise on a few,ep057
654,things,ep057
657,check out this view guys well this view,ep057
660,is amazing,ep057
663,absolutely love it well done eat it yes,ep057
666,we have a two bedrooms open plan living,ep057
669,and you have an outdoor area Wow and,ep057
672,what's the proximity of the beach in,ep057
675,downtown Avalon you're a 20-minute walk,ep057
678,from downtown Avalon and about a,ep057
681,15-minute walk from the beach definitely,ep057
684,a bit further than I was hoping is this,ep057
687,house dog-friendly,ep057
690,and you can definitely have a dog here,ep057
693,but it might not be the most practical,ep057
696,house for a dog and is this the only,ep057
699,access to the house it is the only,ep057
702,access our legs will definitely get in,ep057
705,shape but we might need to build a slide,ep057
708,babe what is the price on this one so,ep057
711,"it's slightly over budget at 2,200 Suns",ep057
714,good,ep057
717,Wow this is stunning love the open,ep057
720,layout it's exactly what we were looking,ep057
723,for I love that the deck connects to the,ep057
726,living room and you could have one big,ep057
729,open-air living space and there's even a,ep057
732,fireplace,ep057
735,it's really great we also have a really,ep057
738,good loft area that's supposed to be the,ep057
741,master bedroom no it's not the master,ep057
744,bedroom but it'd be great for guests,ep057
747,staying over extra storage or you know,ep057
750,kids running around nice I really like,ep057
753,that option and I think that the spiral,ep057
756,staircase adds a lot of character to the,ep057
759,home I don't know if I see mom and dad,ep057
762,or little kids running up and down it'd,ep057
765,be a nice rec room or movie room or,ep057
768,shipping yeah every boss rented left,ep057
771,here I like the bathroom the great color,ep057
774,paint and really cool subway tiles tub,ep057
777,is huge plus agreed it's really nice,ep057
780,well why don't we check out your master,ep057
783,bedroom,ep057
786,okay it's a bit tight isn't it yeah it,ep057
789,is a little tight well it tastes a bit,ep057
792,on the smaller side but you do have the,ep057
795,double built-in wardrobe yeah this is,ep057
798,really nice and it'll definitely fit,ep057
801,everything we brought with us see every,ep057
804,second bedroom is fitter odds hair is,ep057
807,more like a closet we could make this,ep057
810,work Christine and I have agreed on a,ep057
813,lot but there's certainly some things,ep057
816,that I don't fully agree with her on the,ep057
819,bedrooms are just tiny Wow this kitchens,ep057
822,fantastic I love how spacious it is I,ep057
825,know there's so much natural light on,ep057
828,all sides it's like a bar yeah that's,ep057
831,great you could be on the grill and I,ep057
834,can serve you a beer love that Oh baby I,ep057
837,love this outdoor deck look at this view,ep057
840,could stare at this all day overall I,ep057
843,really love this property I love that,ep057
846,it's a standalone home with tons of,ep057
849,character and the open layout is,ep057
852,fantastic but the location for me is a,ep057
855,bit far from the beaches and downtown,ep057
858,Avalon coming to Australian is living,ep057
861,out my dream I just hope we get the,ep057
864,location that I've always dreamt about,ep057
867,and those stairs are not really,ep057
870,practical having to bring Tallulah up,ep057
873,every time she needs a walk who do you,ep057
876,think that's gonna you know rely on me I,ep057
879,think that this million-dollar view more,ep057
882,than makes up for it I know Kristine,ep057
885,really loves that view but she's,ep057
888,definitely gonna have to,ep057
891,give me a lot of loving I'm gonna be in,ep057
894,hot water house three is full of,ep057
897,surprises,ep057
900,doesn't have a view but it has a pool,ep057
903,and one woman's loss is another man's,ep057
906,pool party I didn't even know it was on,ep057
909,our wish list but after he saw it it,ep057
912,went right to the top he's swimming and,ep057
915,grilling at the same time it's just a,ep057
918,smaller view of water,ep057
921,Christine Ben and their dog Tallulah are,ep057
924,over DC,ep057
927,and our restarting downunder,ep057
930,how amazing is this rock pool we're,ep057
933,sitting in right now we'll be pristine I,ep057
936,have known each other for two years,ep057
939,we've been married for only six months,ep057
942,and yet we've taken this huge turn in,ep057
945,our lives and I just want you to be,ep057
948,happy that's my main goal in DC we,ep057
951,didn't have that much time to spend,ep057
954,together we would maybe have a couple,ep057
957,hours after work every night we'd spend,ep057
960,time together on the weekends we're here,ep057
963,we can spend the day together we can go,ep057
966,explore I've never seen anything like,ep057
969,this in the state I don't think they,ep057
972,have anything like this in this state,ep057
975,it's been really nice just to have that,ep057
978,day-to-day you know going through life,ep057
981,together,ep057
984,and I mean look at this view it's just,ep057
987,absolutely stunning do we ever have to,ep057
990,go back what's most important to me it's,ep057
993,find a place that we can call home,ep057
996,because moving to Australia without jobs,ep057
999,and a whole lot of unknown what's,ep057
1002,difficult I think both of us are really,ep057
1005,excited to get some stability back in,ep057
1008,our lives,ep057
1011,[Applause],ep057
1014,step1 just ability is finding a place to,ep057
1017,call home taking it to this phone guys,ep057
1020,cuz it's really good value and how close,ep057
1023,to the beaches,ep057
1026,I think the northern beaches are hidden,ep057
1029,gem of Sydney you're about three minute,ep057
1032,walk to the beach Wow,ep057
1035,I love the idea of waking up in the,ep057
1038,morning going for a run down to the,ep057
1041,beach and having a swim but I think it's,ep057
1044,gonna take a little work to convince,ep057
1047,Christine this is the right choice for,ep057
1050,us the most practical choice you don't,ep057
1053,have much of a view a little bit,ep057
1056,terrible and seems pretty generic house,ep057
1059,2 has the view and the style wow this is,ep057
1062,stunning could stare at this all day the,ep057
1065,location for me is a bit far from the,ep057
1068,beaches and downtown Avalon the main,ep057
1071,downside of that house is that it's not,ep057
1074,very dog-friendly every time we walked a,ep057
1077,little half to walk her up those stairs,ep057
1080,definitely a big negative the next house,ep057
1083,is in a fantastic location,ep057
1086,it's got heaps of charm really nice,ep057
1089,backyard and it's fenced in so it's good,ep057
1092,for Tallulah it is over budget but they,ep057
1095,are getting a really nice pool with,ep057
1098,house so I wanted to take you to this,ep057
1101,house guys it's really unique full of,ep057
1104,character and it's dog friendly oh great,ep057
1107,Jon's good it's a two-bedroom,ep057
1110,one-bathroom house and it's mean ten,ep057
1113,minutes walk from downtown Avalon five,ep057
1116,minute walk to the beach does it have a,ep057
1119,view doesn't have a view but it has a,ep057
1122,pool oh wow Wow,ep057
1125,wouldn't thought we could get a pool,ep057
1128,with our budget I wouldn't have either,ep057
1131,no well it is slightly over budget which,ep057
1134,"is it it's 2,200 okay but let's have a",ep057
1137,look yeah sounds great first thing I,ep057
1140,noticed was though gates Oh Tallulah,ep057
1143,could be free to roam anywhere which is,ep057
1146,a huge plus I know she'd love that,ep057
1149,welcome in thanks a lot like how open,ep057
1152,and bright it is just behind you here,ep057
1155,you have your guest bedroom it's really,ep057
1158,big I like the size of the bedroom and,ep057
1161,lots of natural light not much of a view,ep057
1164,so you have a really great master,ep057
1167,bedroom,ep057
1170,I like the pendant lights but this room,ep057
1173,seems a little bit smaller than the,ep057
1176,other bedroom we saw,ep057
1179,it is slightly smaller we can always,ep057
1182,switch it up and use the other one,ep057
1185,that's the master bedroom okay yeah the,ep057
1188,pressure of keeping my new wife happy is,ep057
1191,certainly mounting I love how close it,ep057
1194,is to the beach and downtown Avalon but,ep057
1197,it really doesn't have a view so maybe,ep057
1200,not the ideal choice for Christine you,ep057
1203,have the bathroom,ep057
1206,Diderot air oh great I like that there's,ep057
1209,a tub and a shower,ep057
1212,yeah tiles nice yeah and you have great,ep057
1215,open plan living I love all the cool,ep057
1218,light fixtures and fans yeah it's very,ep057
1221,beachy yeah it's wonderful that's nice,ep057
1224,check out the kitchen,ep057
1227,love the stats teal toss almost like a,ep057
1230,restaurant kitchen a gas range with a,ep057
1233,hood we've really fun to cook in here,ep057
1236,yeah I love these windows what are these,ep057
1239,called the louvers they're really common,ep057
1242,in Australian homes because you get that,ep057
1245,natural air flow just hope the mozzies,ep057
1248,don't come after you I know do you guys,ep057
1251,want to check out the after area,ep057
1254,absolutely look at this pool the pool is,ep057
1257,amazing he's swimming and grilling at,ep057
1260,the same time no it's like a vacation,ep057
1263,home I really really love the backyard,ep057
1266,it's great love it Ben's eyes lit up,ep057
1269,when he saw that pool so I feel like,ep057
1272,there's gonna be a little tension as we,ep057
1275,try to figure out which home is for us,ep057
1278,because I think we both have the first,ep057
1281,choice and they don't think it's the,ep057
1284,same house I love the open layout and,ep057
1287,it's very unique there's a lot of,ep057
1290,character in this home which I think we,ep057
1293,really like and I love that it's dog,ep057
1296,friendly for me the location is great I,ep057
1299,mean a few minutes to the beach and a,ep057
1302,few minutes to downtown Avalon with the,ep057
1305,pubs and restaurants I love that,ep057
1308,I think the thing we're giving up there,ep057
1311,is any views of the water though it's,ep057
1314,just a smaller view of water the pool,ep057
1317,yeah,ep057
1320,what really consider a view of water I,ep057
1323,think it's stressful try and decide on,ep057
1326,where we're gonna pick a home I really,ep057
1329,want the right location Kristine is,ep057
1332,pushing more for a view and one of us is,ep057
1335,certainly gonna have to compromise that,ep057
1338,house was exactly what I was envisioning,ep057
1341,when I knew we were looking for a home,ep057
1344,up here probably not the most practical,ep057
1347,house I don't know if I can give up that,ep057
1350,view base when Ben and Christine found,ep057
1353,each other,ep057
1356,they also found a new sense of purpose,ep057
1359,we've kind of left a lot of friends and,ep057
1362,family we had some very good careers,ep057
1365,which has been really hard to do but we,ep057
1368,wanted to focus on ourselves the,ep057
1371,adventurous pair is looking to find a,ep057
1374,rental that has it all central location,ep057
1377,great views and a place their dog,ep057
1380,Tallulah can bury your bones so amazing,ep057
1383,but there's trouble in paradise,ep057
1386,Christine wants a view and on their,ep057
1389,budget that means giving up Ben's,ep057
1392,beachside dream,ep057
1395,what do you think the townhouse was,ep057
1398,definitely the most practical option,ep057
1401,"1,800 per month I love the location so",ep057
1404,close to the beach and Tallulah is gonna,ep057
1407,love this backyard this would be here,ep057
1410,top two ain't that thing but it lacked,ep057
1413,the view or any character seems pretty,ep057
1416,generic I really like the view house,ep057
1419,I loved that as soon as you walk in the,ep057
1422,front door you see a very experience of,ep057
1425,view of the bay could stare at this all,ep057
1428,day they had tons of character the only,ep057
1431,thing is it's not very dog-friendly is,ep057
1434,this the only access to the house it is,ep057
1437,the only access we might need to build a,ep057
1440,slide the pool house unbelievable with,ep057
1443,the pool swimming and grilling at the,ep057
1446,same time a ton of character they love,ep057
1449,all the cool light fixtures and fans and,ep057
1452,the location is perfect but there were,ep057
1455,no views in the water,ep057
1458,[Music],ep057
1461,I think the townhouse has to go it was,ep057
1464,under budget but I think it lacked any,ep057
1467,wow factor and no view and no view so,ep057
1470,that leaves us with a pool house and the,ep057
1473,view house I know you really love that,ep057
1476,view house I do love the view house,ep057
1479,I loved that as soon as you walk in the,ep057
1482,front door you see a very experience of,ep057
1485,view of the bay that house was exactly,ep057
1488,what I was envisioning when I knew we,ep057
1491,were looking for a home up here it's,ep057
1494,kind of a beach bungalow and I feel like,ep057
1497,we'd be really happy in that,ep057
1500,indoor/outdoor living space probably not,ep057
1503,the most practical house because of the,ep057
1506,fact it's not great for Tallulah and I,ep057
1509,don't think it's her number one choice,ep057
1512,no outdoor space really for her in the,ep057
1515,location I mean we're a much further,ep057
1518,distance from the beach and all the,ep057
1521,shops and restaurants and pubs the pool,ep057
1524,house has the location that I absolutely,ep057
1527,wanted moving to Australia and I thought,ep057
1530,the pool was a huge added bonus I think,ep057
1533,bottom line is one of us is gonna have,ep057
1536,to compromise view versus location yep,ep057
1539,but I want you to be happy I want you to,ep057
1542,be happy,ep057
1545,seeing your face as we walk down that,ep057
1548,massive staircase at the view house that,ep057
1551,view is amazing the open layout it's,ep057
1554,unique I knew that's the kind of,ep057
1557,character you were looking for I think,ep057
1560,we should go with the view house okay,ep057
1563,it's a sign in so excited we're both,ep057
1566,really happy with our decision to leave,ep057
1569,the rat race with relocates Australia,ep057
1572,we've absolutely been loving it the beef,ep057
1575,here 2054 a grill this thing's really,ep057
1578,good we call it a barbecue it's a big,ep057
1581,sigh relief for me that Christine so,ep057
1584,happy you realize that Australian miles,ep057
1587,are born when barbecuing in their DNA,ep057
1590,then where'd you born that's right we,ep057
1593,made the choice of the view home one of,ep057
1596,us had to compromise come on me and so,ep057
1599,happy I did it's an amazing home it's,ep057
1602,bright its airy and I love the deck who,ep057
1605,cares if it's a little impractical,ep057
1608,enjoying a cup of coffee or tea look at,ep057
1611,this view I know it's amazing this house,ep057
1614,definitely wasn't the most practical,ep057
1617,choice come and it's not the most dog,ep057
1620,friendly either but we've made it work,ep057
1623,because we spent a lot of time at the,ep057
1626,dog beaches the dog parks and I think,ep057
1629,everyone's happy with the overall,ep057
1632,situation I really think it's fulfilling,ep057
1635,a circle of life where my parents had me,ep057
1638,here in Australia and now back here with,ep057
1641,my lovely white feet in the sand,ep057
1644,it's an unbelievable dream come true,ep057

27,decades he's always been frugal one,ep058
30,price I would use someone cheap but Jan,ep058
33,is looking for French charm,ep058
36,well you could lie in bed and wash your,ep058
39,feet at the same time I think it would,ep058
42,be okay I don't think so but Tim can,ep058
45,only see big dollar signs so what's,ep058
48,wrong with it,ep058
51,you see anything that we would need to,ep058
54,do except for maybe set the table no,ep058
57,shall we sign the paper now or you want,ep058

81,they'd be nice to have a home overseas,ep058
84,someone you like yeah got some exposed,ep058
87,beams there Jim gets very emotional,ep058
90,about seeing the houses after running,ep058
93,around all the time when it comes to,ep058
96,budget it's nice but it's over the,ep058
99,budget move on we've been saving for 10,ep058
102,years yeah this to happen so now we're,ep058
105,both ready to pull the trigger at the,ep058
108,same time the finances are there to be,ep058
111,able to pull it off so now it's the time,ep058
114,full we've traveled around Europe quite,ep058
117,a bit and we just really fell in love,ep058
120,with the Burgundy area it's got a lot to,ep058
123,see and do to start with we're gonna be,ep058
126,going over months at a time I'm an IT,ep058
129,security consultant I can virtually work,ep058
132,anywhere so eventually we would like to,ep058
135,live there permanently everyone's going,ep058
138,to come visit at least once we have,ep058
141,three grown daughters and we have three,ep058
144,grandsons going up we're gonna miss the,ep058
147,boys it's gonna be tough being away from,ep058
150,the grandkids all the kids and our,ep058
153,mothers how they going to talk about how,ep058
156,it's very emotional,ep058
159,[Music],ep058
162,we've never done anything like this,ep058
165,before but we know we're really gonna,ep058
168,enjoy this new face of our lives,ep058
171,burgundy is situated in the heart of,ep058
174,friends this charming region blends two,ep058
177,French passions beautiful scenery and,ep058
180,great wine it's full of small villages,ep058
183,you can really have a beautiful house,ep058
186,with this old French charm for a very,ep058
189,good price it's a great experience to,ep058
192,meet a couple coming from Texas who want,ep058
195,to share their life between their home,ep058
198,country and burgundy first of all I want,ep058
201,to be a very old property character okay,ep058
204,beams and in exposed rocks oh yeah,ep058
207,you'll have that exposed rocks okay some,ep058
210,outdoor space with a garden may be room,ep058
213,for a swing for when the grandchildren,ep058
216,come over sure I definitely need three,ep058
219,bedrooms so that all of our family can,ep058
222,come to visit and at least two bathrooms,ep058
225,okay are you open to innovation not so,ep058
228,much it's hard to do renovation when,ep058
231,you're not there full-time so be a,ep058
234,little bit leery of that I'd like to be,ep058
237,close to bone we really really like that,ep058
240,town yes and in terms of budgets you had,ep058
243,in mind two hundred two hundred thousand,ep058
246,okay but if we find just the right place,ep058
249,we could go over there,ep058
252,maybe not good to know so still being in,ep058
255,this price range and not being too far,ep058
258,away from bond it's actually the main,ep058
261,challenge that I have to hunt a place,ep058
264,for a team a dream to stay on budget,ep058
267,Luke needs Tim and Jan to venture,ep058
270,outside a bone so for house 1 he hopes,ep058
273,to woo them with character and space,ep058
276,despite the location so here we are oak,ep058
279,sawn oak saw it's 25 minutes away from,ep058
282,bone it's a little far yeah keep in mind,ep058
285,that you will need a car okay okay this,ep058
288,is a house right here oh that's cute,ep058
291,that's a big big house and how many,ep058
294,bedrooms three bedrooms and bathrooms,ep058
297,two bathrooms and lots of leading space,ep058
300,and price it's a hundred and eighty,ep058
303,thousand five hundred and nine mm-hmm,ep058
306,very good it's gonna have a look all,ep058
309,right after you thank you,ep058
312,oh I like this look at the beans nice,ep058
315,and it's got a beautiful fireplace I,ep058
318,love that and so this might be the,ep058
321,dining room,ep058
324,exactly furniture it comes with oh,ep058
327,everything yes all the furnitures you,ep058
330,see coming okay so buy a table and we're,ep058
333,done with in this room it looks like it,ep058
336,we like the fact that it's a large room,ep058
339,and as far as renovations not too much,ep058
342,only to expose a stone wall right here,ep058
345,you have the kitchen oh wow it's a,ep058
348,nice-sized kitchen I like it it's a,ep058
351,little tight over here I think to get,ep058
354,two of us in there I don't know,ep058
357,I want reconfigure it so that the actual,ep058
360,work space is a little larger that,ep058
363,sounds like going way over the budget,ep058
366,could so yeah if you come this way you,ep058
369,have a living room with beautiful tiles,ep058
372,amazing not as crazy about this decor,ep058
375,it's just fine no it's just behind at,ep058
378,least one of these walls there's the,ep058
381,stone this one no but these ones for,ep058
384,sure,ep058
387,I think Timur and Jen see that some work,ep058
390,has to be done but the renovation is not,ep058
393,that huge and this way starts the,ep058
396,bedrooms okay,ep058
399,very narrow stairs so welcome to your,ep058
402,bedroom,ep058
405,please hi this I don't think so bedroom,ep058
408,and bathroom oh well you could lay in,ep058
411,bed and and wash your feet at the same,ep058
414,time just about let's talk about,ep058
417,something positive the floor I like,ep058
420,nothing else something would have to be,ep058
423,done about that like erect some kind of,ep058
426,a wall I'm a little bit concerned about,ep058
429,it going,ep058
432,over the budget I know I should be,ep058
435,concerned about it but that doesn't,ep058
438,bother me I think it would be okay I,ep058
441,don't think so okay here we have a,ep058
444,decent sized bedroom two beds for your,ep058
447,grandchildren visits they have their own,ep058
450,little sink over there the shower is one,ep058
453,thing but this is okay yeah I think for,ep058
456,family and friends to come there's,ep058
459,plenty of room there's three bedrooms,ep058
462,let's go see the yard actually yeah I,ep058
465,like this already it's beautiful oh very,ep058
468,nice very pretty it's not that big,ep058
471,though I think it's gonna be okay,ep058
474,yeah yeah because there's low,ep058
477,maintenance beautiful garden several,ep058
480,places to set up picnic tables and have,ep058
483,fun with the family and friends when,ep058
486,they come over you can have dinner and,ep058
489,the evening okay you can have a lot of,ep058
492,people to dine outside yes okay so what,ep058
495,do you think about this house overall I,ep058
498,like that not too crazy about the,ep058
501,upstairs bedroom slash bats yes so we,ep058
504,definitely would need to put a wall up,ep058
507,and all the wallpaper down and repaint,ep058
510,maybe some wallpaper good stay wallpaper,ep058
513,needs to go happy wife happy life,ep058
516,yes finds Tam a bargain it's on sale for,ep058
519,"130,000 us ours so what's wrong with it",ep058
522,but will Jan pay the price I think the,ep058
525,stairs could use a little renovation I,ep058
528,think he looks at the selling price and,ep058
531,then he just kind of thinks,ep058
534,like this work,ep058
537,gorgeous what's the name of the castle,ep058
540,chateau de cosas most high school,ep058
543,sweethearts Tim and Jan have spent,ep058
546,decades traveling the world we started,ep058
549,dreaming about this over 40 years ago,ep058
552,and after years of saving they're about,ep058
555,to embark on that lifetime dream buying,ep058
558,a second home in Burgundy France yes,ep058
561,it's not gonna be easy just leaving,ep058
564,family we definitely want to make sure,ep058
567,that in choosing this place it's large,ep058
570,enough and welcoming enough for,ep058
573,everybody to come over that's a big big,ep058
576,house I like this look at the beams oh,ep058
579,my gosh she wants perfection,ep058
582,it's a little tight over here I think,ep058
585,that's I would reconfigure it so that,ep058
588,the actual workspace is a little larger,ep058
591,Oh bedroom and bathroom something would,ep058
594,have to be done about that and he's,ep058
597,focused on the price that sounds like a,ep058
600,long way over the budget,ep058
603,the next property is a bit further away,ep058
606,from BOM but I wanted to show John and,ep058
609,Tim this house because it has a,ep058
612,beautiful view it's a big size,ep058
615,especially if you want to rent is that,ep058
618,the house on the hill there yeah that's,ep058
621,the house on the hill there oh my,ep058
624,goodness,ep058
627,welcome to sharni this is one of the,ep058
630,numerous cute little village of Burgundy,ep058
633,that was a long drive that was how far,ep058
636,bone are we it's 45 minutes away but we,ep058
639,have small villages with shops close by,ep058
642,okay it's a beautiful view yeah,ep058
645,beautiful yeah and it's all very quiet,ep058
648,here and this is the house okay,ep058
651,the house with the barn it's a cute,ep058
654,house how many bedrooms three fan too,ep058
657,bad one bath but hang on it's unsafe for,ep058
660,"130,000 us ours",ep058
663,that's why it's just needs renovation,ep058
666,native innovation then first of all the,ep058
669,roof has some parts to fix okay sure,ep058
672,please,ep058
675,the view is just gorgeous very nice,ep058
678,right into the kitchen yes exactly,ep058
681,well it's a cute little kitchen it is,ep058
684,and appliances the furniture comes with,ep058
687,the house with yes Oh,ep058
690,price is really good it's a fairly small,ep058
693,kitchen but I think it's average France,ep058
696,I didn't see where it needed any,ep058
699,renovation I like that,ep058
702,well it's a good-sized room oh I love,ep058
705,the beam look at that big that's,ep058
708,gorgeous,ep058
711,that's beautiful and uh stone wall I,ep058
714,love that that room appeared like it,ep058
717,needed a fresh coat of paint something,ep058
720,probably believe we could do mm-hmm,ep058
723,and it connects quickly with a dining,ep058
726,room okay okay,ep058
729,well it's a good-sized room it's kind of,ep058
732,an odd floorplan I don't know how old is,ep058
735,this house but I would say maybe around,ep058
738,1600 s so the layouts at that time you,ep058
741,know we're much different okay let's go,ep058
744,upstairs to the bedroom well carefully,ep058
747,the stairs I say I think the stairs,ep058
750,could use a little renovation yes here's,ep058
753,the first bedroom,ep058
756,oh very small very small from a rental,ep058
759,perspective you know when we're not here,ep058
762,but this would be well received I think,ep058
765,it's still decent size plus you have,ep058
768,three bedrooms okay I don't think this,ep058
771,house would be a concern I think,ep058
774,anything that's less expensive for you,ep058
777,you're willing to move in that direction,ep058
780,I might compromise that dog Oh hon so,ep058
783,here are two bedrooms for your kids so,ep058
786,your grandchildren one here and one,ep058
789,another one connects yes you have to go,ep058
792,through one bedroom to get from one to,ep058
795,the other,ep058
798,uh-huh so here is a conservatory oh this,ep058
801,is very cute,ep058
804,yes I can see us here having a glass of,ep058
807,wine in the evening oh wow,ep058
810,look at this this is gonna make you,ep058
813,happy plenty of room for strawberries,ep058
816,and raspberries and blackberries and,ep058
819,apple trees and swing sets so guys what,ep058
822,do you think about this house it has,ep058
825,some charm,ep058
828,there's things I don't care about it the,ep058
831,configuration upstairs is very odd the,ep058
834,price is right with money left over for,ep058
837,renovations I like that it does shock me,ep058
840,a little bit that he's open to it,ep058
843,however I think he looks at the selling,ep058
846,price and then he just kind of thinks we,ep058
849,could come in low on the renovations and,ep058
852,make this work I do love the view you,ep058
855,can't beat that in this yard is lovely,ep058
858,and this is a big plus for renting keep,ep058
861,it in mind okay okay I would like to see,ep058
864,something that we could pretty much just,ep058
867,move into and be good to go Luke finds,ep058
870,Jen the house of her dreams oh look at,ep058
873,this this is all the character I'm,ep058
876,looking for but will the price tag give,ep058
879,Tim nightmares she's gonna probably try,ep058
882,to convince me to take this property,ep058
885,even though it's over the budget you can,ep058
888,limbo I'm not sure I'm gonna listen,ep058
891,okay highschool sweethearts,ep058
894,Tim and Jan love traveling the globe,ep058
897,along into a lock and after years of,ep058
900,saving they're searching for their dream,ep058
903,home in Burgundy France there's a big,ep058
906,difference between us when it comes to,ep058
909,finances I shop with my heart he shops,ep058
912,with the budget in mind I don't know,ep058
915,which way this is gonna go bring us,ep058
918,closer together,ep058
921,are we gonna quibble about everything,ep058
924,how do you say psychological room for ya,ep058
927,hello cheek that's right Tim wants a,ep058
930,bargain first Jan wants space and French,ep058
933,charm but in France she's learning charm,ep058
936,may actually mean quirky Oh bedroom and,ep058
939,bathroom something would have to be done,ep058
942,about that not as crazy about this decor,ep058
945,it's just fine no it's just Kim's dream,ep058
948,comes true with house to its own self,ep058
951,"for 130,000 years ours just needs",ep058
954,renovation but Jan worries this,ep058
957,fixer-upper the roof has some parts to,ep058
960,fix is really a money pit I think the,ep058
963,stairs could use a little renovation I,ep058
966,don't like the way the bedrooms are set,ep058
969,up very small very small you have to go,ep058
972,through one bedroom to get from one to,ep058
975,the other,ep058
978,so for house three Luke finds Jan her,ep058
981,no it's move-in-ready but comes at a,ep058
984,price so here we are in Pam blow that's,ep058
987,a small village I have beautiful,ep058
990,surroundings and this is the house okay,ep058
993,it's very cute it has three bedrooms and,ep058
996,two bathrooms and it's just brand new so,ep058
999,you can arrive we just suitcases and,ep058
1002,it's there's nothing to do how much,ep058
1005,money that's a little above your budget,ep058
1008,so it's two hundred and ten thousand,ep058
1011,years sizable yeah we'll try okay love,ep058
1014,the way it looks on the outside very,ep058
1017,nice please coming in look at this,ep058
1020,beautiful it's updated but it's still,ep058
1023,got the old beams and the floor and it's,ep058
1026,beautiful and the furniture does come,ep058
1029,with this all come true you see anything,ep058
1032,that we would need to do except for,ep058
1035,maybe set the table no sure shall we,ep058
1038,sign the paper now you want to see the,ep058
1041,rest of the house oh push a real estate,ep058
1044,agent oh I absolutely love the style,ep058
1047,all the character and the way they made,ep058
1050,it look she's gonna probably try to,ep058
1053,convince me to take this property even,ep058
1056,though it's over the budget I'm not sure,ep058
1059,I'm gonna listen this is a living room,ep058
1062,watch your head yes we're looking at the,ep058
1065,bottom of the floor from stairs okay I,ep058
1068,think it's a little on the small side,ep058
1071,maybe but I think Jan really likes the,ep058
1074,place the fact that it's move-in ready,ep058
1077,the furnishings are just what she wants,ep058
1080,this is all the character I'm looking,ep058
1083,for I'm not sure about the beam the low,ep058
1086,beam for me to be able to walk I think I,ep058
1089,could probably,ep058
1092,they're sloped ceilings do worry me a,ep058
1095,little bit you trying to get into bed so,ep058
1098,here's another bedroom and the bathroom,ep058
1101,okay what's red what's a beams there my,ep058
1104,goodness this is a very cute bathroom,ep058
1107,that is so cute but it is very,ep058
1110,up-and-down I almost feel drunk when I'm,ep058
1113,walking in yeah yeah it's making me a,ep058
1116,little dizzy it makes it awkward makes,ep058
1119,it a little awkward but the house is I,ep058
1122,think Jan would say our style mm-hmm and,ep058
1125,I would agree it fits with us that's a,ep058
1128,big bonus Wow my goodness here's your,ep058
1131,yard,ep058
1134,oh you can plant anything you want,ep058
1137,anything I want to plant I could have a,ep058
1140,cornfield what else you like what do you,ep058
1143,think about this place I like the house,ep058
1146,a lot it's got a lot of character it's,ep058
1149,decorated beautifully updated the rooms,ep058
1152,are a little bit on the small side the,ep058
1155,price is over our budget a little bit,ep058
1158,concerned about that I love almost,ep058
1161,everything about this house it's exactly,ep058
1164,what I've always pictured it's it's the,ep058
1167,French home that that you picture in,ep058
1170,your mind when you're back in the States,ep058
1173,but it's over our budget and I'm not,ep058
1176,sure that he can manage to be happy with,ep058
1179,that this is a once in a lifetime,ep058
1182,opportunity that we've dreamed about and,ep058
1185,I want to do it right I mean I,ep058
1188,understand that there has to be a budget,ep058
1191,but if I find something that really,ep058
1194,tears it my heartstrings I'm willing to,ep058
1197,stretch probably a little more than you,ep058
1200,are so we have to find a job to pay for,ep058
1203,it all,ep058
1206,this is a beautiful day a gorgeous day,ep058
1209,for decades high school sweethearts Tim,ep058
1212,and Jan have been saving for a second,ep058
1215,home overseas I'm mostly just can't even,ep058
1218,believe we're really gonna make this,ep058
1221,happen they both want French charm in,ep058
1224,Burgundy,ep058
1227,but that's where their agreement ends,ep058
1230,I'm excited and nervous at the same time,ep058
1233,so what did you think about the,ep058
1236,attachment I like that it's under budget,ep058
1239,the kitchen was a little tight to get,ep058
1242,two of us in there I don't know it's got,ep058
1245,a good space for when we have family and,ep058
1248,friends I do not like that master,ep058
1251,bedroom bath though oh we have the,ep058
1254,budget to put a wall up and make it a,ep058
1257,separate bathroom I hopefully do we,ep058
1260,don't know exactly how much that'll cost,ep058
1263,what about that house up on the hill,ep058
1266,oh yeah anything else like that oh the,ep058
1269,price is really good it was hugely under,ep058
1272,budget but the amount of renovations to,ep058
1275,me we'd be done on that one the roof has,ep058
1278,some parts to fix I think the stairs,ep058
1281,could use a little renovation we have to,ep058
1284,add a bathroom what do you think about,ep058
1287,the move-in-ready house you know how I,ep058
1290,feel about the character on that one,ep058
1293,beautiful I love,ep058
1296,everything you dream up when you think,ep058
1299,of your house in France the rooms seem a,ep058
1302,little small and this house was over,ep058
1305,"budget it's 200 in 10,000 years",ep058
1308,[Music],ep058
1311,I think I have one that I could cross,ep058
1314,off my list okay I think I know which,ep058
1317,one you're thinking about the hilltop,ep058
1320,house the hilltop house,ep058
1323,there's too many renovations it's just,ep058
1326,too much to take them okay I didn't,ep058
1329,think I would say this but I'm leaning,ep058
1332,towards the attached house are you I,ep058
1335,think the smaller garden makes more,ep058
1338,sense it'd be easier to maintain,ep058
1341,especially when we're not here and it,ep058
1344,does need some renovation we can do it,ep058
1347,but the one that's already all renovated,ep058
1350,it's ready to go oh my goodness I love,ep058
1353,all the character in that house the,ep058
1356,character is great but the rooms are,ep058
1359,small and it's over budget I'm concerned,ep058
1362,about that I know well the rooms were,ep058
1365,smaller but they were decorated so cute,ep058
1368,from the tile on the floor to the beams,ep058
1371,and the ceilings and so much don't work,ep058
1374,I know we can bring out the character in,ep058
1377,this house it's gonna be some work but I,ep058
1380,think we can do it you think we can sir,ep058
1383,I absolutely love the patio on that,ep058
1386,house outside I think we can make it a,ep058
1389,great place to live and to be a home for,ep058
1392,friends and family okay so what do you,ep058
1395,think do you think I could see him in,ep058
1398,her family there having everybody over,ep058
1401,[Music],ep058
1404,Texas Boehner to everyone welcome to our,ep058
1407,new home I'm so excited I think this was,ep058
1410,the perfect house for us love it here,ep058
1413,already done a whole lot of gardening,ep058
1416,which I enjoy doing the kitchen has,ep058
1419,worked out better than where I thought,ep058
1422,some cheese and some crackers,ep058
1425,you wanted some wine always some wine I,ep058
1428,do want to do some updating but it will,ep058
1431,come in time and for me there still is,ep058
1434,the budget there will be a budget always,ep058
1437,a budget mr. accountant I still haven't,ep058
1440,made peace with the upstairs master,ep058
1443,bedroom bath that wall can't go up quick,ep058
1446,enough for me probably my favorite part,ep058
1449,of the house is the backyard it's just,ep058
1452,beautiful out there we send pictures,ep058
1455,back almost daily to the family keep,ep058
1458,them updated they're all excited about,ep058
1461,coming over can't wait I still have to,ep058
1464,just pinch myself that we're living here,ep058
1467,after 40 years in the biking mm-hmm,ep058
1470,we're living our French dream,ep058
1473,[Music],ep058
12,oh and this is spectacular I love this,ep059
15,Paul and Amanda are searching for a,ep059
18,vacation cabin in the small resort town,ep059
21,of Shaver Lake California that Wilson,ep059
24,ceilings would accent walls this is,ep059
27,fantastic there are two big issues she,ep059
30,wants move-in-ready look at how modern,ep059
33,everything is I love the granite,ep059
36,well he's open to a fixer-upper and he's,ep059
39,also more fixated on the places rental,ep059
42,ability and she is,ep059
45,we've got a full over full so we can,ep059
48,sleep more people can she get him to,ep059
51,prioritize their comfort over future,ep059
54,renters I am very much more family,ep059
57,minded when I'm thinking of this place,ep059
60,and I know Paul is thinking let's make,ep059
63,some money,ep059
66,[Music],ep059
69,how was your trip it was good my name is,ep059
72,Paul and I work at a local winery in the,ep059
75,supply chain department my name is,ep059
78,Amanda I'm currently a flight attendant,ep059
81,but the plan is to transition out of,ep059
84,that so that I can be a stay at home,ep059
87,long and also do my freelance,ep059
90,photography we just recently had a baby,ep059
93,he's five weeks old and his name is,ep059
96,Christian Paul you want to travel the,ep059
99,world with mom and dad Paul is an,ep059
102,amazing family man he's a planner he,ep059
105,loves to plan every detail which is,ep059
108,wonderful because I do not Amanda's very,ep059
111,outgoing she's a dreamer I mean she's,ep059
114,got lots of ideas but on the other side,ep059
117,there's an execution part and so I think,ep059
120,that's when the planning s becomes in,ep059
123,and I believe that's what makes us a,ep059
126,great team I bet you that's gonna pair,ep059
129,really well with a cab one we live in,ep059
132,Clovis California which is in the,ep059
135,Central Valley and the closest big city,ep059
138,to us is Fresno so we still have all the,ep059
141,amenities of a big city but we still get,ep059
144,that country feel but during the summer,ep059
147,Fresno and Clovis it's so hot so they,ep059
150,like to escape to the cooler climate of,ep059
153,Shaver Lake a small mountain resort,ep059
156,village that's just 45 minutes away it's,ep059
159,20 degrees cooler people go out there,ep059
162,all the time just to be out on the lake,ep059
165,and to get away from the heat and in the,ep059
168,winter it's a popular cold-weather,ep059
171,retreat during the holiday season,ep059
174,both flock to shaver as well because of,ep059
177,the snow we were looking to buy a,ep059
180,vacation cabin in Shaver Lake for our,ep059
183,personal use but we also want to make,ep059
186,sure that we can use it as a rental as,ep059
189,well to offset some of those operational,ep059
192,costs to make it more manageable so this,ep059
195,is this is the Pacific Lodge I want more,ep059
198,of the cabin feel I want to know that,ep059
201,we're in the woods warm wood feel maybe,ep059
204,some stone features on the outside when,ep059
207,you walk in maybe the cathedral ceiling,ep059
210,with the exposed beam floor-to-ceiling,ep059
213,windows that you have amazing views I,ep059
216,don't know if I love this though I don't,ep059
219,like that there's two stories there I,ep059
222,just want a single story I'd prefer a,ep059
225,cottage I think they're so cute they're,ep059
228,charming it looks like a little Hansel,ep059
231,and Gretel cabin in the woods that's,ep059
234,what I'm looking for something quaint oh,ep059
237,can possibly live with quaint but he,ep059
240,insists the place be big enough to be,ep059
243,cost-effective as a vacation rental this,ep059
246,home is gonna pay for itself over time,ep059
249,so it's gonna me be able to sleep a,ep059
252,certain amount of people it's gonna need,ep059
255,to have two or three bedrooms the idea,ep059
258,of having other people in our home is a,ep059
261,little bit gross and creepy to me but I,ep059
264,understand that it's necessary oh that's,ep059
267,nice,ep059
270,"our budget is 400,000 and I'm okay with",ep059
273,going over if we find something that's,ep059
276,turnkey we just had a baby we're not,ep059
279,sleeping so I don't want to do any work,ep059
282,about this it's just dated I think the,ep059
285,benefit of having a home that that needs,ep059
288,a little bit of work typically those,ep059
291,homes mean that they're undervalued so I,ep059
294,believe that we can invest a little bit,ep059
297,into it whether that's sweat equity or,ep059
300,we could pay contractors do the work,ep059
303,themselves to bring the value back up if,ep059
306,you find something that's just,ep059
309,dilapidated I think I just will have to,ep059
312,put my foot down and say no look at that,ep059
315,beautiful waffle we've ever seen my,ep059
318,dream vacation home would be a nice big,ep059
321,open space I want a big chef's kitchen a,ep059
324,big deck would be awesome a great,ep059
327,outdoor space that includes a fire pit,ep059
330,and a hot tub however we think about a,ep059
333,vacation and we know that people are,ep059
336,gonna be out there so the hot tub the,ep059
339,fire pit huge liability somebody,ep059
342,catching this house on fire somebody get,ep059
345,in the hot tub and,ep059
348,spiller mimosa inside of it those are,ep059
351,the things that concern me the most best,ep059
354,waffles ever when we think about a,ep059
357,vacation meant I think people really,ep059
360,want home that's close to the village I,ep059
363,think people really want home that's,ep059
366,close to the lake Amanda on the other,ep059
369,hand wants privacy and would rather be,ep059
372,in a more isolated area I really think,ep059
375,mostly about our family I want to have a,ep059
378,place out there where we can get away,ep059
381,where it's just a retreat but you know,ep059
384,that vacation rental revenue is gonna,ep059
387,help us offset some of those additional,ep059
390,costs,ep059
393,cheers Cheers it's beautiful out here,ep059
396,love it so they're up in Shaver Lake to,ep059
399,meet agent Ron Henson to look at a house,ep059
402,in Paul's ideal location close to the,ep059
405,village maybe a 10-minute walk to the,ep059
408,lake five minutes of restaurants really,ep059
411,popular location for vacation rental for,ep059
414,weekends okay okay I definitely love the,ep059
417,cottage feel it's super cute so I would,ep059
420,rather have more of a cabin or the,ep059
423,Pacific lodger you know what's nice,ep059
426,though is the deck it looks a little,ep059
429,deeper than I thought built in 1989,ep059
432,three-bedroom two-bath and it's listed,ep059
435,for just 359 okay let's check it out,ep059
438,right this is cozy it's nice that it's,ep059
441,one-story here and the furniture is,ep059
444,negotiable so we've got wood here,ep059
447,there's no fireplace but there was,ep059
450,something here structurally what's going,ep059
453,on here there was an old wood stove that,ep059
456,won't meet EPA so the sellers removed it,ep059
459,in advance you can look at as an,ep059
462,opportunity for a new wood stove,ep059
465,fireplace it would be really nice to,ep059
468,have a fireplace I do like how I could,ep059
471,be in the kitchen and I could be cooking,ep059
474,we can have people sitting here but,ep059
477,definitely not my chef's kitchen yeah,ep059
480,it's a little dated it's gonna need some,ep059
483,work I think if we wanted to open this,ep059
486,up a little bit more this might have to,ep059
489,go I think we would probably go with,ep059
492,different colors too like white we,ep059
495,brighten it up it sounds like so much,ep059
498,work it's pretty dated Paul is very,ep059
501,ambitious I love that about him but it,ep059
504,also makes him a little crazy when it,ep059
507,comes to all of the remodeling that he,ep059
510,wants to do we literally just had a baby,ep059
513,so it's overwhelming right now,ep059
516,looking around I mean there's there's,ep059
519,tons of real estate so I don't know if I,ep059
522,would say tons I don't love that I can,ep059
525,see all of our neighbors where's the hot,ep059
528,tub no hot tub,ep059
531,fire pit nope all right I feel a little,ep059
534,bit better I don't back inside they look,ep059
537,at a bedroom and a bathroom did you step,ep059
540,up for this yeah it's a step up like,ep059
543,literally a cave shower and I just think,ep059
546,we would have to rearrange this because,ep059
549,there's maybe potential but this is,ep059
552,taking up so much space the other,ep059
555,bedroom alrighty,ep059
558,Oh a Christian could sleep in one of,ep059
561,these the bunk bed is awesome we've got,ep059
564,a full over full so we can sleep more,ep059
567,people which is gonna be great value and,ep059
570,I think what I see here is a trundle I'm,ep059
573,a vacation rental standpoint this is,ep059
576,this is a tremendous amount of value for,ep059
579,just a small amount of space can we,ep059
582,negotiate this in no doubt okay the,ep059
585,trundle bed option that we found was,ep059
588,awesome that puts us in a position where,ep059
591,we can market this home as a vacation,ep059
594,rental that can sleep nine potentially,ep059
597,10 people annual revenue I think it's,ep059
600,gonna be in the twenty six thousand,ep059
603,range Paul is definitely the financial,ep059
606,planner of our family but for me I,ep059
609,definitely go to family I'm thinking,ep059
612,what kind of memories can we make here,ep059
615,okay this one's a little bit bigger it's,ep059
618,great to have a tub for Christian Oh,ep059
621,and so as you're taking a bath you can,ep059
624,do laundry that looks like so we've got,ep059
627,a washer/dryer within the bath okay not,ep059
630,crazy about this we can do stackables,ep059
633,right here's a master bedroom okay well,ep059
636,good it's bigger than the other ones,ep059
639,yeah,ep059
642,[Music],ep059
645,it's not a Civic lodge however the,ep059
648,location is perfect you know from a,ep059
651,vacation rental standpoint this is the,ep059
654,direction we want to go,ep059
657,I think the cottage look of it is super,ep059
660,cute but it's definitely a fixer-upper,ep059
663,and that's not what I wanted I think,ep059
666,what I want to see next I definitely,ep059
669,want to see the Pacific Lodge okay,ep059
672,but getting to Pauls Pacific Lodge is a,ep059
675,bit of a trek we are completely isolated,ep059
678,on our own but I like that there's no,ep059
681,other houses around no other people so,ep059
684,that's nice,ep059
687,[Music],ep059
690,this is a great area surrounded with all,ep059
693,these trees Paul and Amanda are in the,ep059
696,market for a vacation slash rental cabin,ep059
699,in the small mountain resort town of,ep059
702,Shaver Lake California however making,ep059
705,sure the home appeals to renters is more,ep059
708,of a priority for Paul than it is for,ep059
711,Amanda I am very much more family minded,ep059
714,when I'm thinking of this place and I,ep059
717,know Paul is thinking let's make some,ep059
720,"money working with a budget of $400,000",ep059
723,they've seen a cozy cottage perfect for,ep059
726,Amanda but it needed a lot of work and,ep059
729,Paul prefers more of a Pacific Lodge,ep059
732,style look at this view that's beautiful,ep059
735,I'm showing you this house today - Paul,ep059
738,and Amanda because this is a Pacific,ep059
741,lodge and it's pretty much turnkey that,ep059
744,we're 10 to 12 minutes away from the,ep059
747,village maybe 15 18 minutes away from,ep059
750,the lake it did take a long time to get,ep059
753,up here you can't even see a house,ep059
756,we are completely isolated on our own,ep059
759,but I like that there's no other houses,ep059
762,around no other people so that's nice hi,ep059
765,Ron morning what do you think I think,ep059
768,this is perfect this is the Pacific,ep059
771,Lodge you know this has got the real,ep059
774,nice wood warm feel it's definitely not,ep059
777,my cottage style but I do think it's,ep059
780,charming,ep059
783,what aspects it's 2 bedroom bath and a,ep059
786,half you're gonna find the inside very,ep059
789,interesting because the second bedroom,ep059
792,is actually a large loss that's been,ep059
795,"divided into it's listed at $379,000",ep059
798,enter revenue maybe 15 to 25 30 thousand,ep059
801,a year,ep059
804,perfect oh my gosh look at this this is,ep059
807,the Pacific Lodge yes it ceilings wood,ep059
810,accent walls this is fantastic,ep059
813,I like it which I'm surprised because,ep059
816,it's not my cottage yeah they did a,ep059
819,great job with this what do you think,ep059
822,about the openness I think it's great,ep059
825,there's a lot of room we could have the,ep059
828,whole family here I could see us doing,ep059
831,Thanksgiving here yeah are they counting,ep059
834,this as a bedroom yes it's got four beds,ep059
837,can actually sleep six people oh that's,ep059
840,great that's a huge plus I don't know,ep059
843,how I feel about that,ep059
846,that's dangerous I mean the kids could,ep059
849,just fall off the loft this is called,ep059
852,liability,ep059
855,all right can we take a look at the,ep059
858,kitchen please look at this look at the,ep059
861,dark knots on the cabinets this is,ep059
864,beautiful craftsmanship is impeccable,ep059
867,look at all the detail here they did a,ep059
870,really nice job of complementing,ep059
873,high-end appliances what still a rustic,ep059
876,feel and then wood-burning stove does,ep059
879,that work yes oh this is great oh man,ep059
882,this is spectacular look at these views,ep059
885,this is incredible I love this is our,ep059
888,hot tub no hot tub no fire pit no fire,ep059
891,pit I love it yeah that's perfect for me,ep059
894,the bedrooms back in the opposite corner,ep059
897,okay it's small I mean I like what they,ep059
900,did with the furniture here is this,ep059
903,furniture included can we mr. Ghoshal,ep059
906,okay okay I like it across here is their,ep059
909,full bath all right custom made yeah I,ep059
912,like that they head upstairs to look at,ep059
915,the loft this is a Donna massive loft,ep059
918,that concerns me,ep059
921,honestly I feel like this is a,ep059
924,deal-breaker this is just,ep059
927,yeah the fabric separating yeah I love,ep059
930,the idea that we're sleeping six people,ep059
933,up here but I mean do you want to sleep,ep059
936,this close to everybody all right a,ep059
939,little tiny bath I think it's simple it,ep059
942,does the job but there is no shower and,ep059
945,there's no bath to have a half bath,ep059
948,upstairs where you're sleeping six,ep059
951,people that's just a equation for,ep059
954,disaster there's your walk-in closet no,ep059
957,that's a closet,ep059
960,this is awesome oh my gosh,ep059
963,so what do you think of a house you have,ep059
966,the pine vaulted ceilings it is the,ep059
969,definition of a Pacific lodge it's not,ep059
972,my cottage but I love the charm of it I,ep059
975,love the character it's move-in-ready,ep059
978,but the big things you know that really,ep059
981,concern me is the distance how far took,ep059
984,us get out here the whole loft situation,ep059
987,really cool idea but not as a bedroom so,ep059
990,is there something else that you can,ep059
993,show us it's maybe closer to town that's,ep059
996,more aligned with features of a rental I,ep059
999,think so location and size aren't an,ep059
1002,issue with this next house but it too,ep059
1005,has its issues I don't like the gray,ep059
1008,yeah it's kind of bland new parents Paul,ep059
1011,and Amanda are searching the small,ep059
1014,mountain resort town of Shaver Lake,ep059
1017,California for a vacation cabin that,ep059
1020,they can rent out when they're not using,ep059
1023,"it but in their $400,000 price range",ep059
1026,they're having trouble finding a place,ep059
1029,that balances her wish for a,ep059
1032,family-friendly cozy cottage and his,ep059
1035,desire for a Pacific Lodge style home,ep059
1038,that he thinks will get the best rental,ep059
1041,rate,ep059
1044,so far they've seen a cottage that was,ep059
1047,within walking distance of the village,ep059
1050,and lake but it needed work and was too,ep059
1053,close to the neighbors for Amanda,ep059
1056,then they saw Pacific lodge with amazing,ep059
1059,views but it was isolated and the,ep059
1062,bedroom layout wasn't ideal,ep059
1065,[Music],ep059
1068,- beautiful day so now their real-estate,ep059
1071,agents lined up a place he hopes will be,ep059
1074,a good compromise just a 5-minute drive,ep059
1077,to the village and ten minutes to the,ep059
1080,lake this home isn't too remote and has,ep059
1083,been completely updated very traditional,ep059
1086,no it's not the Pacific lodge that I,ep059
1089,like not my cottage either but it's,ep059
1092,still cute well it was built in 1992,ep059
1095,it's got three bedrooms and three,ep059
1098,bathrooms it also has a little upstairs,ep059
1101,loft and bonus it's got two car garage,ep059
1104,oh nice with easy access so give me the,ep059
1107,other side of the equation the catch,ep059
1110,yes 449 is it asposed okay and the,ep059
1113,furniture and decor is not included I,ep059
1116,don't like the gray yeah it's kind of,ep059
1119,bland I like this deck out here oh wow,ep059
1122,this is beautiful this is the Pacific,ep059
1125,Lodge I was looking for I love that they,ep059
1128,painted this white but then it's nice,ep059
1131,that they left some of it exposed so,ep059
1134,this is a little a little tricky I'm,ep059
1137,thinking about Christian with these,ep059
1140,stairs just dangerous to me I just think,ep059
1143,about the kids running up and down the,ep059
1146,stairs following up and down the stairs,ep059
1149,oh wow this is beautiful this is it I,ep059
1152,love the wood I love the stone oh and,ep059
1155,this deck wraps all the way around,ep059
1158,that's awesome gosh the price tag does,ep059
1161,it's making more sense now,ep059
1164,this is really nice this kitchen is,ep059
1167,beautiful look at how modern everything,ep059
1170,is I love the granite yeah I agree,ep059
1173,as much as I'm preaching I want the,ep059
1176,Pacific Lodge when it comes to the,ep059
1179,kitchen I want something clean and want,ep059
1182,something fresh modern and I think this,ep059
1185,does it this is perfect,ep059
1188,this is open-concept how far out does,ep059
1191,this property go only another 50 or 60,ep059
1194,feet,ep059
1197,that's enough space for a fire pit we've,ep059
1200,got that open land though that is,ep059
1203,amazing you see how you just avoided the,ep059
1206,fire pit altogether is there a hot tub,ep059
1209,no all right this is a win they take a,ep059
1212,look at the loft space off the living,ep059
1215,room,ep059
1218,and here on the right we have a bathroom,ep059
1221,with laundry this is a nice size yeah I,ep059
1224,don't think it's a deal to have washer,ep059
1227,and dryer here and depend Roomster down,ep059
1230,here they go downstairs to look at two,ep059
1233,bedrooms I love the ceiling it's all,ep059
1236,naughty Oh naughty,ep059
1239,okay and another full bath nice cute,ep059
1242,lamp here we have the master oh wow,ep059
1245,man this is great I like the windows and,ep059
1248,then there's an ensuite bathroom this is,ep059
1251,so cool wow this is like a hotel I think,ep059
1254,this is the first home that we've seen,ep059
1257,that actually has two tubs what do you,ep059
1260,think you know it doesn't have the curb,ep059
1263,appeal but it has a Pacific logs written,ep059
1266,over every single room everything is big,ep059
1269,and open this is turnkey however is it,ep059
1272,going to generate that rental revenue,ep059
1275,it's not what you business to the,ep059
1278,village you know we're not walking,ep059
1281,distance to the lake that's a concern,ep059
1284,it's not a single level and I wish it,ep059
1287,was we definitely have a lot to talk,ep059
1290,about,ep059
1293,to determine which house will be the,ep059
1296,right kind of vacation slash rental they,ep059
1299,need Paul and Amanda we'll have to see,ep059
1302,if styled amount of work or location,ep059
1305,takes priority final decision final,ep059
1308,decision,ep059
1311,[Music],ep059
1314,Paul and Amanda are ready to buy a,ep059
1317,vacation slash rental cabin in Shaver,ep059
1320,Lake California having looked at several,ep059
1323,"options in their $400,000 price range",ep059
1326,they're ready to make a decision you,ep059
1329,know we've got the cottage in the,ep059
1332,village at 359 it's walking distance to,ep059
1335,the village it's walking distance to the,ep059
1338,lake it meets some of those like perfect,ep059
1341,choir ms4 you know what we need from a,ep059
1344,rentability standpoint but it's not what,ep059
1347,I want it's not the Pacific lodge see,ep059
1350,and I love the look of it there's my,ep059
1353,cottage it's so cute it is single level,ep059
1356,so I love the exterior but it's a,ep059
1359,fixer-upper it's not isolated like I,ep059
1362,like I like to feel that privacy what,ep059
1365,about the Pacific Lodge up on the hill,ep059
1368,beautiful views you know listen at 379,ep059
1371,it's beautiful we don't have to do,ep059
1374,anything to it and I'm so excited about,ep059
1377,that but it is complete isolation you,ep059
1380,know you're in the woods we were way out,ep059
1383,there I thought that was kind of a plus,ep059
1386,but the loft situation it just doesn't,ep059
1389,work I didn't see some dangerous things,ep059
1392,happening with Christian falling over,ep059
1395,that log then we have the traditional,ep059
1398,home so definitely outside of our price,ep059
1401,range at 449 the exterior looks like,ep059
1404,just any other house but I mean the,ep059
1407,inside was spectacular it really did,ep059
1410,have that Pacific lodge warm feel,ep059
1413,it was beautiful and then it's turnkey,ep059
1416,but it's a big price tag it's definitely,ep059
1419,out walking this into the lake,ep059
1422,the village I I think we need to make a,ep059
1425,decision what do you think I know I want,ep059
1428,to turnkey but I love the cottage it's,ep059
1431,not the Pacific Lodge but we're still,ep059
1434,within budget and we're gonna have money,ep059
1437,and do the remodel I'm not excited about,ep059
1440,fixing something up but I could really,ep059
1443,put my own personal stamp on that place,ep059
1446,this is gonna be great for for renters,ep059
1449,as a vacation rental and it's gonna be,ep059
1452,perfect for our family all right final,ep059
1455,decision final decision cottage,ep059
1458,I found the job we were looking for it,ep059
1461,feels great to finally have our vacation,ep059
1464,home and I love that it's a cottage I,ep059
1467,love that it's got great proximity to,ep059
1470,the village and the lake this is what it,ep059
1473,would look like here I think it's great,ep059
1476,the house was listed at 359 and we ended,ep059
1479,up at 300 thousand the furniture,ep059
1482,situation was all negotiated in in the,ep059
1485,final prices all right we took,ep059
1488,possession of the house about two weeks,ep059
1491,ago and we jumped right in with all of,ep059
1494,the renovations right on the gates you,ep059
1497,know one to freshen up everything so we,ep059
1500,repainted all of the rooms a really,ep059
1503,fresh bright white we had pulled out,ep059
1506,that old wood-burning stove put in this,ep059
1509,massive fireplace do you remember before,ep059
1512,these were cabinets we wanted it more,ep059
1515,open concept so we knocked out the,ep059
1518,cabinets the existing cabinets we're,ep059
1521,just gonna freshen them up give it a,ep059
1524,nice facelift nice bright white yeah and,ep059
1527,then we're gonna do blue for the lowers,ep059
1530,just to give it a pop of color the next,ep059
1533,big step is the countertops a man in,ep059
1536,fact that are really beautiful quartz,ep059
1539,like countertops then the backsplash,ep059
1542,guys are coming in the next day so,ep059
1545,that'll be a subway a really clean white,ep059
1548,subway tile I'm gonna get some snow,ep059
1551,Paul's done a really great job with,ep059
1554,sectioning off our renovation process,ep059
1557,we're in phase 1 currently phase 2 is,ep059
1560,bathroom renovation we're planning on,ep059
1563,gutting both bathrooms and just starting,ep059
1566,from scratch celebration my biggest,ep059
1569,compromise in buying this house is that,ep059
1572,it's a fixer-upper but it's been so fun,ep059
1575,to personalize this space and now,ep059
1578,Christian's gonna grow up in the,ep059
1581,mountain we're gonna come up here all,ep059
1584,the time and he'll have such a great,ep059
1587,childhood,ep059
12,Wow geez gorgeous recent transplants,ep060
15,Ryan and Jamie are searching for their,ep060
18,first home in rural Washington State,ep060
21,this is awesome yeah I can really,ep060
24,entertain here I like how modern the,ep060
27,countertops are Wow whoa he wants a,ep060
30,place in the country it's five acres we,ep060
33,have chickens pigs but she wants a home,ep060
36,closer to town yeah I think it's super,ep060
39,cute it feels just like home where I,ep060
42,grew up and as with most first-timers,ep060
45,this house hunt will come with,ep060
48,compromises,ep060
51,I don't like counterspace feel like I'm,ep060
54,living it this isn't like a cabin oh,ep060
57,it's pretty small,ep060
60,this seems modern to me it's bright I,ep060
63,wish the whole house would look like,ep060
66,this,ep060
69,[Music],ep060
72,yeah I can't update the logo for you my,ep060
75,name is Jamie and I do real estate,ep060
78,photography and digital media marketing,ep060
81,for local businesses here my name is,ep060
84,Ryan and I work for the state Fish and,ep060
87,Wildlife we live in Twisp Washington,ep060
90,we've been here about three years got,ep060
93,NASPA invited us over for a barbecue,ep060
96,Wyatt Jamie is the funny one she has a,ep060
99,lot of personality and a lot of energy,ep060
102,she's my closest friend Ryan,ep060
105,I call him my sexy nerd because he's a,ep060
108,biologist so he really cares about the,ep060
111,environment but he's attractive so it's,ep060
114,really nice to be able to have someone,ep060
117,with brains and brawn I guess I third,ep060
120,blue one in there you gotta go back we,ep060
123,are both from a suburb of Chicago we,ep060
126,went to the same high school together so,ep060
129,we've known each other like half our,ep060
132,lives but we didn't actually start,ep060
135,seeing each other till after we,ep060
138,graduated college we both moved to the,ep060
141,west coast I used to live in Los Angeles,ep060
144,so Ryan had found a job in Sacramento to,ep060
147,try to get as close as possible but a,ep060
150,job opportunity for Ryan as a state,ep060
153,biologist meant yet another move this,ep060
156,time up north to Washington State,ep060
159,because my occupation um it's very,ep060
162,specialized and so I can only work in a,ep060
165,few areas where these sort of jobs exist,ep060
168,central Washington with a spot that I've,ep060
171,been looking at for years because it's,ep060
174,such a beautiful place,ep060
177,Jamie joined him and they've lived here,ep060
180,for three years now what I like about,ep060
183,there is that there's more public land,ep060
186,than anywhere in the northwest every,ep060
189,weekend we go hiking,ep060
192,Ryan fishes I run on all the trails it's,ep060
195,a really cool area right now we're,ep060
198,renting we decided to buy now just to,ep060
201,have something that's our own we are,ep060
204,both first-time homebuyers,ep060
207,and there's no starting homes here,ep060
210,there's no condos no townhouses so you,ep060
213,need to buy like a big ol 3-bedroom,ep060
216,you're gonna have your kids here someday,ep060
219,tryin to house but the highest we're,ep060
222,"willing to go is about $400,000 look at",ep060
225,this I love these boots and while they,ep060
228,love living in Twisp they're also,ep060
231,considering buying in the town of,ep060
234,Winthrop ten minutes to the north,ep060
237,Winthrop is the town that people from,ep060
240,Seattle come to visit,ep060
243,it's the tourist town its western themed,ep060
246,Winthrop is where all the nightlife is,ep060
249,as much of the nightlife is this,ep060
252,community for back,ep060
255,I really don't want like a giant log,ep060
258,home no I don't want log either my,ep060
261,favorite architectural style is,ep060
264,contemporary I like a little bit of,ep060
267,luxury but the style of house in this,ep060
270,area is built from scratch a lot of log,ep060
273,homes a lot of people would tell you,ep060
276,it's charming I find it a little old and,ep060
279,dated my favorite architectural style is,ep060
282,something that seems durable pretty,ep060
285,simple kind of like the old pioneer,ep060
288,Prairie homes for bedrooms I think three,ep060
291,bedrooms,ep060
294,all right so guest room our bedroom I,ep060
297,want an office I really like an open,ep060
300,layout too because we live in such a,ep060
303,beautiful place we're always having,ep060
306,friends come visit I'm going to be nice,ep060
309,to have a house is a little bigger for,ep060
312,"entertaining up to about 2,000 square",ep060
315,feet a large kitchen having modern,ep060
318,countertops would be great I really,ep060
321,would like a master bathroom right now,ep060
324,we have to walk across the house every,ep060
327,single time we have to pee I would like,ep060
330,a house that's near a running trail or a,ep060
333,hiking trail I really would like to have,ep060
336,beautiful views from the house besides,ep060
339,the property is very important to me in,ep060
342,terms of livestock having a few acres to,ep060
345,allow them to spread out would be really,ep060
348,helpful we're gonna do two pigs chickens,ep060
351,I don't know why I already have two,ep060
354,gardens but I can have more gardens you,ep060
357,can always have more gardens I might cap,ep060
360,you on the biggest thing though is that,ep060
363,I don't want it we already live sort of,ep060
366,in the middle of nowhere so I don't want,ep060
369,a house in the middle of nowhere in the,ep060
372,middle of nowhere having a place closer,ep060
375,to town where the nightlife is would be,ep060
378,better for me you guys like salsa yeah,ep060
381,me my favourite Juanita's we've been,ep060
384,together a long time I mean I think we,ep060
387,do it finally feel like maybe we're,ep060
390,getting a little secure in life,ep060
393,occasionally as well as emotionally so I,ep060
396,think this home sort of represents the,ep060
399,next step,ep060
402,[Music],ep060
405,first up there bro quran' has found a,ep060
408,home in the countryside a few miles,ep060
411,outside Winthrop this place is on five,ep060
414,acres yeah I do like it it's a very,ep060
417,clean look straight lines it's nice so,ep060
420,being a city girl being in the country,ep060
423,is pretty intimidating for me just,ep060
426,something I need to get used to so this,ep060
429,"house is three bedrooms two baths 2,500",ep060
432,"square feet and it's listed for $400,000",ep060
435,that's right at the top of our budget,ep060
438,that's pretty high,ep060
441,so here's the foyer there was an,ep060
444,original log cabin then they added on,ep060
447,and built the big beautiful house on to,ep060
450,it why don't you follow me into the,ep060
453,guest room yeah you could always maybe,ep060
456,whitewash or sand this to kind of tone,ep060
459,it down a little bit yeah this one dark,ep060
462,maybe changing the carpet yeah yeah it,ep060
465,matches the log this is like a cabin but,ep060
468,look at the view from here you can,ep060
471,mountain bike ski and run right out on,ep060
474,these trails out here fast like that,ep060
477,yeah so over here's the bathroom a,ep060
480,little bit more log yeah and the sink is,ep060
483,way more modern than I would have,ep060
486,thought it was actually it's kind of,ep060
489,nice look how big this kitchen is dining,ep060
492,space,ep060
495,whoo there's a lot of storage space,ep060
498,don't really like the tile,ep060
501,it seems gonna be hard to keep clean,ep060
504,this oven is really dated this is pretty,ep060
507,old but you know it functions just fine,ep060
510,and over time you can pick out the one,ep060
513,that really fits and works for you,ep060
516,"mm-hmm the $400,000 price tag is making",ep060
519,me really nervous and the house is a,ep060
522,little bit of a fixer-upper so we might,ep060
525,even spend more money than that and I,ep060
528,don't know if we have it Wow whoa this,ep060
531,is like night and day from the log room,ep060
534,it's like a completely different house I,ep060
537,really like the view from the sunroom I,ep060
540,think that really takes everything we,ep060
543,have in a valley and pulls it into the,ep060
546,home wait to see the outside view from,ep060
549,the terrace yeah,ep060
552,Wow geez that view that's gorgeous it's,ep060
555,incredible it was pretty amazing,ep060
558,how much of this is ours it rent down to,ep060
561,this fence line right down here at the,ep060
564,bottom of the hill and that runs around,ep060
567,this Knoll and out to the driveway wow,ep060
570,it's pretty big it's almost too big it's,ep060
573,kind of intimidating take care of yeah,ep060
576,look at the view it is in crisis so come,ep060
579,check out this living room slap more log,ep060
582,again yeah have you was really good,ep060
585,though,ep060
588,the view is awesome but like I don't,ep060
591,want a log house and this is way more,ep060
594,log and I was expecting to be honest,ep060
597,next it's upstairs to see the master,ep060
600,bedroom,ep060
603,this spacious lovely large master closet,ep060
606,oh yeah that's nice this was the,ep060
609,addition that was added on with the,ep060
612,sunroom oh yeah so it different and I'd,ep060
615,like how this room is constructed this,ep060
618,seems modern to me it's bright I wish,ep060
621,the whole house look like this that's,ep060
624,kind of like a clean slate it doesn't,ep060
627,have a lot but you can change it to,ep060
630,whatever you need where's the master,ep060
633,bathroom well there isn't a master bath,ep060
636,connected to the master bedroom it's,ep060
639,actually down the hall I am so,ep060
642,disappointed if we're going to be buying,ep060
645,a home especially at the top of our,ep060
648,price range that's something I was,ep060
651,really expecting it's pretty good-sized,ep060
654,wow it does look like a master bathroom,ep060
657,even though it's all be over here yeah,ep060
660,it is pretty big so Ryan around the,ep060
663,corner there is the third bedroom yeah,ep060
666,it's pretty nice to make a really good,ep060
669,office,ep060
672,[Music],ep060
675,I really love the views they're gorgeous,ep060
678,the sunroom has a lot to offer yeah I,ep060
681,will admit though I am really,ep060
684,disappointed in how much walk there is I,ep060
687,really do like the five acres it's,ep060
690,enough land for us to spread out and,ep060
693,feel a little bit distant from the,ep060
696,neighbors the kitchen was so spacious,ep060
699,for you and although the appliances,ep060
702,definitely need an upgrade and speaking,ep060
705,of which there's no master bath so even,ep060
708,if we wanted to add it in I don't know,ep060
711,if we can afford that if we're already,ep060
714,spending you know our max comfort level,ep060
717,on this house,ep060
720,so now Anne has lined up a completely,ep060
723,updated cottage and twist,ep060
726,she thinks Jamie will love but Ryan,ep060
729,isn't sold I do like the look at the,ep060
732,cottage style but too close to the,ep060
735,neighbors,ep060
738,[Music],ep060
741,so tonight's you want to watch a movie I,ep060
744,don't know,ep060
747,does anyone movies you pick no it's,ep060
750,terrible Ryan and Jamie have up to four,ep060
753,hundred thousand dollars to buy their,ep060
756,first home near twist Washington he,ep060
759,wants acreage in the country where they,ep060
762,can raise animals but she's aiming for,ep060
765,an updated home close to town so far,ep060
768,they've seen a house on five acres for,ep060
771,Ryan but it was a little isolated for,ep060
774,Jamie and she thought the inside was too,ep060
777,dated and locked cabinets so now their,ep060
780,broker Ann is showing them a place right,ep060
783,in Twisp,ep060
786,the town where they're currently renting,ep060
789,the inside has been completely updated,ep060
792,yeah it's super adorable okay I do like,ep060
795,the look of the cottage style but too,ep060
798,close to the neighbors,ep060
801,I love how updated it is and I really,ep060
804,like that we're right next door to,ep060
807,neighbors it's actually a really,ep060
810,tight-knit community it feels just like,ep060
813,home where I grew up,ep060
816,it's two bedrooms with an office a,ep060
819,"little under 1,600 square feet and it's",ep060
822,listed at 240 which is way under budget,ep060
825,for you yeah that actually is really,ep060
828,affordable it's pretty small,ep060
831,yeah but been a really tall ceiling and,ep060
834,I really like the windows I mean this is,ep060
837,more light than our rental I like the,ep060
840,openness to the kitchen and see everyone,ep060
843,through yeah you know there is a dining,ep060
846,room right through here okay,ep060
849,this is the dining room ooh it'd be,ep060
852,difficult to get a table in here yeah,ep060
855,then we better have like a really tiny,ep060
858,table yeah I like how modern the,ep060
861,countertops are it's no texturing smooth,ep060
864,a little clean yeah I like a modern,ep060
867,kitchen for sure that's nice I think the,ep060
870,white cabinets and black and hour tops,ep060
873,I really like it yeah my favorite thing,ep060
876,about this house is how updated it is I,ep060
879,didn't realize I could find such a,ep060
882,modern looking house in this town this,ep060
885,is the guest room oh it's pretty small,ep060
888,Wow you could fit maybe one guest in,ep060
891,like a single bed we have a lot of,ep060
894,people come and stay for multiple days,ep060
897,so we need a little bigger area to,ep060
900,entertain,ep060
903,this is the only bathroom on the main,ep060
906,floor so it would serve as the master,ep060
909,bathroom really I mean you're having the,ep060
912,guest share space with a master I don't,ep060
915,really like that I really want a master,ep060
918,bathroom let's go take a look at the,ep060
921,master bedroom then it's alright size I,ep060
924,do like the windows in three windows,ep060
927,south-facing that gives a lot of light,ep060
930,in here that's true for this bedroom,ep060
933,that is like the best view I've seen so,ep060
936,far okay well let's go outside and check,ep060
939,out the backyard Wow look at this big,ep060
942,backyard like a big the trees are yeah,ep060
945,and actually I mean it's sort of blocks,ep060
948,off the houses for the neighbors I know,ep060
951,it's to give us some privacy yeah but it,ep060
954,still is pretty small I mean it's kind,ep060
957,of limiting I'm concerned about the yard,ep060
960,isn't quite large enough for the animals,ep060
963,that I want to have chickens and pigs,ep060
966,need enough space for the animals as,ep060
969,well as enough space to keep your,ep060
972,neighbors happy to back inside they head,ep060
975,down to the basement so let's go into,ep060
978,the bedroom first these two small be a,ep060
981,bedroom but it can work for my office,ep060
984,yeah so straight across the hall is,ep060
987,another bathroom that is some bright,ep060
990,flooring oh yeah like I'm in a bowling,ep060
993,alley,ep060
996,but hey I mean it's bigger than the,ep060
999,master bathroom upstairs but there is a,ep060
1002,laundry room back around the corner oh,ep060
1005,yeah yeah I like it it's a little bigger,ep060
1008,than a living room this would be the,ep060
1011,room that we can hang out in so we can,ep060
1014,host the guests upstairs but then we,ep060
1017,could put like a couch and TV down here,ep060
1020,and relax you know yeah media down here,ep060
1023,makes sense,ep060
1026,the price is fantastic on that price is,ep060
1029,so nice it was modern there's not much,ep060
1032,renovation that would go into it,ep060
1035,everything here is really updated modern,ep060
1038,I really like I feel like you like the,ep060
1041,kitchen right yeah I mean that's big,ep060
1044,enough for you and that was a big deal,ep060
1047,but I feel like the house is kind of,ep060
1050,small and right on top of the neighbors,ep060
1053,like we're definitely living in the city,ep060
1056,yeah but I find like the yard and the,ep060
1059,house to be super manageable I mean that,ep060
1062,also restricts what animals we can have,ep060
1065,here you know just two chickens in the,ep060
1068,gardens gonna be pretty small yeah,ep060
1071,actually it's big in a small the fact,ep060
1074,that there's no master bathroom sort of,ep060
1077,a disappointment so now an is lined up a,ep060
1080,place with more land and a master,ep060
1083,bathroom but can Jamie get past the,ep060
1086,style not a big fan of the wooden,ep060
1089,exterior,ep060
1092,[Music],ep060
1095,Ryan and Jamie have up to 400 grand to,ep060
1098,buy their first home near Twisp,ep060
1101,Washington he wants a home in the,ep060
1104,country with space for a garden and,ep060
1107,livestock and she wants an updated house,ep060
1110,close to town with modern amenities,ep060
1113,chief among them and attached master,ep060
1116,bath so far they've seen a house in the,ep060
1119,country for him and a cottage in town,ep060
1122,for her but neither place was a perfect,ep060
1125,fit so today their broker Anne has lined,ep060
1128,up a home a mile outside of Winthrop,ep060
1131,she thinks could be the perfect,ep060
1134,compromise it's sitting on a piece of,ep060
1137,property it's a little bit under 4 acres,ep060
1140,there's plenty of outbuildings on this,ep060
1143,property,ep060
1146,they'll make having livestock and,ep060
1149,growing plants really easy Wow what up,ep060
1152,closer this is the River Gorge right,ep060
1155,there yeah that's pretty sweet,ep060
1158,not a big fan of the wooden exterior,ep060
1161,it's a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath,ep060
1164,"it's a little over 1,600 square feet and",ep060
1167,"the price is at $400,000 that's right at",ep060
1170,the top of our budget,ep060
1173,yeah it's pretty expensive there's a lot,ep060
1176,of outbuildings on this property and,ep060
1179,they're worth a lot of money so that,ep060
1182,really has to be taken into,ep060
1185,consideration when you're looking at the,ep060
1188,"price tag of $400,000 like that you can",ep060
1191,see the river straight from the entryway,ep060
1194,that's cool come on in check out the,ep060
1197,kitchen oh it's a small not all that,ep060
1200,counter space no and it's really,ep060
1203,outdated yeah yep this is pretty old the,ep060
1206,kitchen is really too small and pretty,ep060
1209,outdated I think that would be one of,ep060
1212,the first things we'd have to work on if,ep060
1215,we wanted to participate Wow look at the,ep060
1218,river yeah Wow and there's an outdoor,ep060
1221,bar kitchen Wow you can really entertain,ep060
1224,here yeah I really love the setting on,ep060
1227,the river it's absolutely gorgeous it's,ep060
1230,just so peaceful out there I really like,ep060
1233,it you know an older couple lived here,ep060
1236,so this is really easy to disassemble,ep060
1239,ooh I don't like the wood paneling yeah,ep060
1242,it is sort of a cosmetic nightmare huh,ep060
1245,you know you can paint paneling and that,ep060
1248,would completely tone this down and,ep060
1251,really brighten this room up it would,ep060
1254,need a lot of updating yeah,ep060
1257,still more wood paneling in here Oh a,ep060
1260,lighter wood paneling really good I,ep060
1263,still see the river this is nice,ep060
1266,you can hear it from the bedroom I don't,ep060
1269,think our bed is going to be this big,ep060
1272,too so I think the room is bigger than,ep060
1275,it appears you know actually this isn't,ep060
1278,the master bedroom there's another,ep060
1281,master bedroom upstairs,ep060
1284,this would be more like the guest room,ep060
1287,their own separate bathrooms oh the home,ep060
1290,actually has really good bones but as,ep060
1293,far as cosmetically there's still so,ep060
1296,much of a facelift to do and I don't,ep060
1299,know if we have the finances to do that,ep060
1302,this actually make a really good office,ep060
1305,for me because I have like this nice,ep060
1308,view and then this wall of drawers like,ep060
1311,I feel like I could put all of my,ep060
1314,different like working materials in here,ep060
1317,yeah at the other end of the second,ep060
1320,floor is the master bedroom on the,ep060
1323,openness it carries right on into this,ep060
1326,room I like the high ceilings all,ep060
1329,throughout yeah and I like the fireplace,ep060
1332,they do have more drawers for storage,ep060
1335,it's just so nice I like that it's way,ep060
1338,out of the way you don't have all these,ep060
1341,like clunky storage things all around,ep060
1344,the room it's just in the wall yeah you,ep060
1347,don't need as much furniture the view,ep060
1350,from the deck is really amazing it's,ep060
1353,amazing yeah it is this hot tub,ep060
1356,yeah we're entertaining I love it it's,ep060
1359,pretty great Oh master bathroom yay nice,ep060
1362,I love that there's a master bathroom,ep060
1365,right next to the master bedroom,ep060
1368,I think that is fantastic this is nice,ep060
1371,and big I love it this room could be our,ep060
1374,master closet oh yeah I see that,ep060
1377,River is astounding yeah I love the,ep060
1380,patio and for a whole listing with the,ep060
1383,outdoor kitchen yeah that was great,ep060
1386,I like the master bedroom a lot and the,ep060
1389,house itself has really good bones,ep060
1392,although the cosmetic part of it is,ep060
1395,gonna be a nightmare,ep060
1398,yeah all right at the top of our budget,ep060
1401,yeah but I like the outside I mean the,ep060
1404,property there's almost four acres on,ep060
1407,this plenty of space for livestock a lot,ep060
1410,of outbuildings in the greenhouse no,ep060
1413,they go places we've seen in the valley,ep060
1416,and greenhouses that greenhouse is,ep060
1419,fantastic,ep060
1422,we definitely need to keep those into,ep060
1425,consideration for sure,ep060
1428,now it's time to decide what's more,ep060
1431,important the land the location or a,ep060
1434,master bathroom there's so many options,ep060
1437,though,ep060
1440,[Music],ep060
1443,[Applause],ep060
1446,we do need to talk about the houses Ryan,ep060
1449,and Jamie have up to four hundred,ep060
1452,thousand dollars to spend on their first,ep060
1455,home near Twisp Washington they've seen,ep060
1458,a number of places now it's time to,ep060
1461,decide all right what about the,ep060
1464,two-story gray house listed at four,ep060
1467,hundred thousand kind of towards the top,ep060
1470,of our budget,ep060
1473,mm-hmm and there's logs on the inside a,ep060
1476,part of the house weirdly modern and at,ep060
1479,the same time rustic I mean it's big,ep060
1482,kitchen need some updating,ep060
1485,but it goes so well with the open floor,ep060
1488,plan into that sunroom I mean it's five,ep060
1491,acres you have chickens pigs and it's,ep060
1494,got a beautiful view and how close we,ep060
1497,were to the running and hiking trails,ep060
1500,and that's pretty cool but I have to,ep060
1503,walk all the way across the hall again,ep060
1506,just like our rental to go into the,ep060
1509,bathroom but it's you know if you're,ep060
1512,have your own house you would like a,ep060
1515,master bathroom well I know that you,ep060
1518,like that small cottage and twist listen,ep060
1521,"to $240,000 that house is really",ep060
1524,affordable I like that it's in town we,ep060
1527,can walk to the restaurants the shops a,ep060
1530,lot of things are already even updated,ep060
1533,in there I liked how modern that and,ep060
1536,colorful that floor was but that house,ep060
1539,is really small and they did what they,ep060
1542,could in the kitchen I think you know,ep060
1545,they have modern appliances the cabinets,ep060
1548,were new but living in town we can't,ep060
1551,have the larger animals there right up,ep060
1554,against the neighbors right up against,ep060
1557,the road that master bath really small,ep060
1560,be sharing with guests but that basement,ep060
1563,that's definitely where I could put my,ep060
1566,office yeah have it yes the second place,ep060
1569,to entertain me like a TV room or a,ep060
1572,media room what did you think about the,ep060
1575,rustic wood house on the river that was,ep060
1578,"a set 400,000 oh that property it was",ep060
1581,gorgeous during the summer that patio is,ep060
1584,fantastic with outdoor kitchen and it's,ep060
1587,so big it's again you got the river view,ep060
1590,I mean that is a place you can really,ep060
1593,entertain well that wood paneling I,ep060
1596,"don't like any of it I mean 400,000 to",ep060
1599,be splashing on paint all over the house,ep060
1602,it's gonna be expensive but it is one of,ep060
1605,the first master bathrooms we've seen,ep060
1608,for all the houses we looked at that's,ep060
1611,what I want which one will they choose,ep060
1614,I think that gray 2-story has a lot of,ep060
1617,the things that we're looking for,ep060
1620,the view there is fantastic and it has,ep060
1623,the five acres that I want and then it,ep060
1626,does have a trail system you run every,ep060

1632,oh my gosh okay are we doing this then,ep060

1638,talk to Anne and see if we can get him,ep060
1641,to move a little bit on the price yeah,ep060
1644,if we could drop it down just a little,ep060
1647,bit that'd be perfect yeah all right,ep060

1653,box we closed about a month ago and,ep060
1656,moved in three weeks ago the list price,ep060

1686,make it an island update the tile,ep060
1689,countertops and I didn't get my master,ep060

1695,remodel the master closet that's there,ep060
1698,now and put a bathroom in there and then,ep060
1701,move the master closet to that sort of,ep060
1704,bedroom that was there welcome to my,ep060

330,[Music],ep061
333,today their brokers found a mid-century,ep061
336,modern home that might appeal more to,ep061
339,Nicky than to Gerard yes not much,ep061
342,radition Allah doesn't have that wow,ep061
345,factor give it a chance it's very serene,ep061
348,walking up to the house I was in love I,ep061
351,was pulled down right away,ep061
354,it's not as if pulling up to the house I,ep061
357,was like wow we're here I didn't really,ep061
360,particularly care for this house is,ep061
363,listed for a hundred and seventy five,ep061
366,thousand okay so you will have that,ep061
369,fixer-upper that you wanted her so much,ep061
372,my mid-century modern and excited now I,ep061
375,love the windows already yeah the,ep061
378,windows are nice I love those come into,ep061
381,your mid century modern home Nicky your,ep061
384,sunken living room yes well that is a,ep061
387,mid-century modern fireplace yeah what,ep061
390,exactly that's definitely a statement,ep061
393,piece it's a statement that it needs to,ep061
396,go but I do like this space off the,ep061
399,living room is a dining area I'm not,ep061
402,feeling the dance hall studio and then,ep061
405,you have your updated kitchen it is,ep061
408,updated and nicely done I love the fact,ep061
411,that there aren't white cameras but I,ep061
414,need more space it's it's kind of a,ep061
417,small area at this price point you could,ep061
420,possibly take out this wall that could,ep061
423,work that would open up the space taking,ep061
426,on a wall it sounds pretty expensive,ep061
429,Victoria brought us to this house,ep061
432,because this was a nikkie project quite,ep061
435,frankly Nicky can live here by herself,ep061
438,kudos to Victoria this is a fixer I,ep061
441,wanted to fix her in she gave it to me,ep061
444,this is your space hunter art yeah this,ep061
447,is my space but what is this the Garden,ep061
450,of Eden yeah,ep061
453,no place to place force with the boys,ep061
456,say where the boys gonna play you keep,ep061
459,in mind you can have some landscaping,ep061
462,done but we would have to find out how,ep061
465,much that would cause yeah something's,ep061
468,are considered yeah back inside they see,ep061
471,a family room in the basement well babe,ep061
474,if you ever had any trouble after a long,ep061
477,day you can just take I'm sure the boys,ep061
480,will love this this is nice,ep061
483,you've got thumbs up for me this,ep061
486,basement works for a juror I know why,ep061
489,you like it because it's only space for,ep061
492,you down here absolutely,ep061
495,where's my office gonna go this on you,ep061
498,yeah study and write my dissertation and,ep061
501,all bad I mean I do have an idea for,ep061
504,that let's look over here perhaps you,ep061
507,can have an office in this space this,ep061
510,could possibly work it I mean it needs,ep061
513,to be finished a little bit but I can,ep061
516,make it work upstairs they take a look,ep061
519,at a full bath three bedrooms for the,ep061
522,kids and the master suite whoa this is a,ep061
525,master bath this is the master bedroom,ep061
528,yeah I'm not filling this okay keeps,ep061
531,getting better and better,ep061
534,huh it's breathtaking is that terrible,ep061
537,got a under-the-sea bathroom in here,ep061
540,definitely not a soaker tub I did see,ep061
543,little apprehension and Nikki's face,ep061
546,when we were looking at the bathroom and,ep061
549,also the master bedroom so that kind of,ep061
552,gave me hope like yeah she's gonna,ep061
555,bypass this place,ep061
558,the positives for me it has a lot of,ep061
561,charm the kitchen we would have to knock,ep061
564,down that wall what do you think well I,ep061
567,mean I love the price but I mean it just,ep061
570,seems like a huge project so now for,ep061
573,Gerard their brokers found a more,ep061
576,move-in ready place but that comes at a,ep061
579,price,ep061
582,it's two hundred and fifty nine thousand,ep061
585,[Music],ep061
588,so what do you want to eat huh,ep061
591,you want the Microsoft this blended,ep061
594,family of five has a budget of up to two,ep061
597,hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a,ep061
600,large home in the South Chicago suburbs,ep061
603,so far they've seen a mid-century,ep061
606,fixer-upper that Nikki love but Gerard,ep061
609,wasn't feeling it so today they're,ep061
612,seeing the style of home that he wants,ep061
615,it's a two-story traditional that you've,ep061
618,always know and it's move-in ready,ep061
621,wedding yeah I mean it looks like we've,ep061
624,made it it has a grand presence it does,ep061
627,it's not necessary modern though the,ep061
630,tour picked a winner for me this is,ep061
633,"definitely a Gerard house it's 259,000 I",ep061
636,know I know it's a little over your,ep061
639,budget but I'm sure we can work it out,ep061
642,price isn't comfortable Nikki and Jairaj,ep061
645,just need to let me work my magic come,ep061
648,on in off the entry is a living room,ep061
651,dining room area oh this is horrible,ep061
654,you don't like this bit absolutely not,ep061
657,project number one for me Oh funky no,ep061
660,it's funky all right absolutely not oh I,ep061
663,love these challenge I like the openness,ep061
666,of it,ep061
669,[Laughter],ep061
672,I love the dark brown cabinets it's,ep061
675,moving rates move it in ready ready I,ep061
678,love how open it is from the kitchen to,ep061
681,the family room I can cook dinner and,ep061
684,the boys can you know in here play,ep061
687,watching TV this carpet though you,ep061
690,there's another project but I think,ep061
693,what's your creative touch I think you,ep061
696,can make this work make this room to be,ep061
699,functional you just gonna make this be,ep061
702,move-in ready,ep061
705,absolutely it's big enough to play,ep061
708,football with the boys and play a little,ep061
711,catch and one for grilling I'm a grill,ep061
714,pitmaster really I want to be back,ep061
717,inside on the second floor they take a,ep061
720,look at a full bath and three bedrooms,ep061
723,for the boys trim we'll definitely this,ep061
726,is your master suite,ep061
729,it's cozy it's cozy Victor I was hoping,ep061
732,for a master suite would be a little bit,ep061
735,bigger when you see the double doors and,ep061
738,I'm thinking once I come out and it'll,ep061
741,be yeah I'm like the floors well it has,ep061
744,your soaker tub it's a nice-sized soaker,ep061
747,tub but just missing jet so I mean I,ep061
750,guess I could live with it next they,ep061
753,head down to the finished basement I,ep061
756,know you're gonna love this private area,ep061
759,huge space huge mancave area Oh,ep061
762,oh my god this is it this is what's up,ep061
765,this is what's up that that's the,ep061
768,perfect man cave for you oh man I could,ep061
771,put a beer fridge somewhere this is,ep061
774,what's up I need this anything I need,ep061
777,this okay but it doesn't have a lady,ep061
780,space for me but you know they look,ep061
783,great I like the ladies faces upstairs,ep061
786,in the kid,ep061
789,no really,ep061
792,we'll talk about this later the biggest,ep061
795,selling point of this house is the man,ep061
798,cave it is too dope this is definitely a,ep061
801,Gerrard house it's not the mid-century,ep061
804,modern that I'm looking for I would like,ep061
807,to see something that's more of a,ep061
810,fixer-upper that I can fix that I like a,ep061
813,lot it's move-in ready,ep061
816,plus the man cave Oh little concerned,ep061
819,about the budget for Girard to always be,ep061
822,the budget police now all of a sudden,ep061
825,with this house it's my home theater my,ep061
828,mancave my budget it doesn't make sense,ep061
831,to me now they're seeing a less,ep061
834,expensive home but it comes with,ep061
837,compromises for both of them it's not,ep061
840,mid-century modern that's for sure no,ep061
843,it's not the traditional home that I was,ep061
846,looking for on their suburban Chicago,ep061
849,hunt Gerard and Nikki have been polar,ep061
852,opposites,ep061
855,Gerard wants move-in ready but Nikki,ep061
858,dreams of a fixer-upper I can envision,ep061
861,something and I dream really big and I,ep061
864,"will make a happen with their 250,000",ep061
867,dollar budget so far they've seen a,ep061
870,mid-century fixer-upper for Nikki and a,ep061
873,traditional move-in-ready home for,ep061
876,Gerard today they're seeing a house,ep061
879,their broker hopes will be a compromise,ep061
882,what do you think it's not mid-century,ep061
885,modern that's for sure no it's not the,ep061
888,traditional home that I was looking for,ep061
891,the house is not my style nor Nikki,ep061
894,style so I'm not sure why we're here,ep061
897,it's a ranch-style home but you'll be,ep061
900,surprised I think you'll like it,ep061
903,the price is only a hundred and,ep061
906,eighty-five thousand dollars it doesn't,ep061
909,need a little work my fixer,ep061
912,so it's your fixer-upper but there's,ep061
915,some things for you too I'm sure you'll,ep061
918,like okay yeah let's look inside first,ep061
921,okay okay,ep061
924,this is your sunken living room I like,ep061
927,the openness I'm closing my eyes I,ep061
930,mention this Burghley funeral this is,ep061
933,funeral carpet Oh No but I can see past,ep061
936,it you guys ready,ep061
939,because you're gonna see some things,ep061
942,that you're really gonna have to do some,ep061
945,work on but you have to have the vision,ep061
948,you can make this kitchen whatever you,ep061
951,want to make it think about it as a,ep061
954,clean they still wake up oh lord help me,ep061
957,please you know there is enough money in,ep061
960,the budget for us to redo the kitchen I,ep061
963,have Brandon kitchen just think about it,ep061
966,now there's a eat-in area right over,ep061
969,here I like that hey just look at the,ep061
972,potential potential I'm not looking at,ep061
975,potential I'm looking at how much is all,ep061
978,this gonna cost,ep061
981,I wanted something that's move-in ready,ep061
984,"185,000 is a really great price but with",ep061
987,all the renovations I'm sure it's gonna,ep061
990,top our budget this house is a diamond,ep061
993,in the rough it's so frustrating to try,ep061
996,to get your art to see the beauty and,ep061
999,potential in this home because he can't,ep061
1002,see past the work you're barred I have,ep061
1005,something for you oh wow this is what,ep061
1008,I'm talking about,ep061
1011,big nice deck lots of grass area for the,ep061
1014,boys,ep061
1017,we may have to refinish the deck is that,ep061
1020,okay I guess I can consider absolutely,ep061
1023,okay back inside they see the family,ep061
1026,room has beens remains as you like,ep061
1029,they check out the bedrooms and the full,ep061
1032,bath for the kids,ep061
1035,then the master are we facing the,ep061
1038,driveway in our master bedroom,ep061
1041,well we can hear the teenager come and,ep061
1044,go okay that's a plus a good point,ep061
1047,double sinks look babe it's got myself a,ep061
1050,tub oh boy it's a lot of gold in here,ep061
1053,welcome in Egypt or something yes we,ep061
1056,know it's a fixer-upper space I feel,ep061
1059,like I'm showing two different people,ep061
1062,this house the lover and the hater so,ep061
1065,let's go see the basement the color,ep061
1068,doesn't say mancave that's for sure wow,ep061
1071,it's a huge space put a big-screen TV,ep061
1074,over here I've got my bar right here oh,ep061
1077,what's this over here,ep061
1080,the mirrors oh no yeah it's kind of,ep061
1083,psychedelic could this be my office this,ep061
1086,is a lot of space it is a huge shoe,ep061
1089,space high-five for you I like the price,ep061
1092,bottom line it's a fixer-upper but I,ep061
1095,think it does have a lot of good,ep061
1098,qualities about it I like the space it,ep061
1101,has the beams and the fireplace and the,ep061
1104,soaker tub,ep061
1107,Nikki loves this house and it scares me,ep061
1110,so I'm sure it's gonna be a battle of it,ep061
1113,so now it's decision time and it may all,ep061
1116,come down to price versus projects it's,ep061
1119,just so much I don't know how I can,ep061
1122,handle all of that,ep061
1125,[Music],ep061
1128,trevor this family of five is in need of,ep061
1131,a large home in the south suburbs of,ep061
1134,chicago with a 250 thousand dollar,ep061
1137,budget Gerard and Nicky have seen,ep061
1140,several options now it's decision time,ep061
1143,the mid-century modern it was the lowest,ep061
1146,at 175 that appdev prices it's amazing,ep061
1149,the windows and that house yeah the,ep061
1152,windows were amazing but there was no,ep061
1155,backyard well there were a couple,ep061
1158,projects for me we would have to get,ep061
1161,some landscaping out back to make the,ep061
1164,backyard suitable for the boys we would,ep061
1167,have to work out the kitchen don't,ep061
1170,forget about your oven slash fireplace,ep061
1173,in the let's go,ep061
1176,so the two-story traditional great curb,ep061
1179,appeal it do you had that we've arrived,ep061
1182,look three words move-in-ready there,ep061
1185,were no white cabinets that was a huge,ep061
1188,plus for me let's not forget about that,ep061
1191,man cave but it was 259 6 so was over a,ep061
1194,budget the expander ranch 185 great,ep061
1197,price pretty nice size backyard it had,ep061
1200,my soaker tub it was a complete fixer,ep061
1203,it's not moving Rick it's definitely not,ep061
1206,moving not much additional it's not my,ep061
1209,mid-century modern I'm up for the,ep061
1212,challenge I can see the vision it's just,ep061
1215,so much I don't know I can handle all of,ep061
1218,that so we wanna do better I see your,ep061
1221,vision as far as a fixer-upper that,ep061
1224,wrench house I mean I love the space I,ep061
1227,think it's a go I think that's a good,ep061
1230,choice for us it has everything that we,ep061
1233,need is just gonna take a lot of work,ep061
1236,yeah you babe go ahead we put an offer,ep061
1239,in on the house almost four months ago,ep061
1242,the asking price was 185 we did pay full,ep061
1245,asking price of one hundred and eighty,ep061
1248,five thousand we are in the middle of a,ep061
1251,construction zone right now we haven't,ep061
1254,moved in yet but each day we see the,ep061
1257,progress that's being made,ep061
1260,I see home in our very near future,ep061
1263,that's kind of sexy honey we are,ep061
1266,painting the entire house new flooring,ep061
1269,throughout the entire house new kitchen,ep061
1272,cabinets the kitchen is not exactly open,ep061
1275,to the family room so we did compromise,ep061
1278,and just open up the dining room to the,ep061
1281,family room which still combines our,ep061
1284,eating and dining area and then the,ep061
1287,mancave this is going down have me a,ep061
1290,pool table big-screen TV couches,ep061
1293,I can't wait my office my ladies space,ep061
1296,we'll be in around the corner in the,ep061
1299,basement further down the line we will,ep061
1302,eventually redo our master bathroom but,ep061
1305,look at this one that's how small this,ep061
1308,home wasn't a move-in-ready once I just,ep061
1311,got over the in idea of doing a,ep061
1314,fixer-upper,ep061
1317,decided to trust our vision I mean I,ep061
1320,knew that she was gonna be you know,ep061
1323,diligent detail-oriented and wanna get,ep061
1326,things done being nice that's the,ep061
1329,politically correct way of saying I'm a,ep061
1332,control freak but yeah she's a control,ep061
1335,freak so I knew that this process was,ep061
1338,gonna be taken care of it was the best,ep061
1341,choice feels like finally it's ours and,ep061
1344,we aren't going anywhere we're finally,ep061
1347,in our forever home and I just look,ep061
1350,forward to spending the rest of my life,ep061
1353,in it,ep061
1356,you,ep061
1359,[Music],ep061
12,I think of all the things we're gonna,ep062
15,see once we get to central London it's,ep062
18,so exciting,ep062
21,Chad and Lara have a unique outlook on,ep062
24,life she's a designer with a thing for,ep062
27,the eighteen hundred's,ep062
30,I was very much well known for,ep062
33,Victorians styling and he's a medical,ep062
36,professional with a flair for the,ep062
39,whimsical we're very close to the,ep062
42,hospital's excellent twelve years ago,ep062
45,they were students in central London so,ep062
48,I want a gorgeous country mansion with a,ep062
51,large garden couple horses with the,ep062
54,twelve servants and now they're back,ep062
57,with two kids in tow ready to put down,ep062
60,roots so you want a bit of countryside,ep062
63,but also you want the Metropolitan,ep062
66,benefits of the city pretty far I'm,ep062
69,tempted to just try something cheeky,ep062
72,[Music],ep062
75,[Applause],ep062
78,for the first time so we're moving to,ep062
81,West London I'm doing a program where,ep062
84,we're promoting the physician assistant,ep062
87,a profession in the National Health,ep062
90,Service in England I definitely,ep062
93,encourage Chad to apply for this job,ep062
96,because I really want my children to be,ep062
99,exposed to cultures all around the world,ep062
102,and it's all here in London okay here we,ep062
105,go,ep062
108,to where we lived before in central,ep062
111,London we cannot afford anymore because,ep062
114,prices have changed 12 years ago I am,ep062
117,very eccentric I love beauty and art,ep062
120,yesterday the woman said you're not,ep062
123,allowed to yes sorry I am a really,ep062
126,easygoing person I tend to be calm,ep062
129,thoughtful and logical I'm again yes,ep062
132,there's different things involved in a,ep062
135,house hunt the logic of finding the,ep062
138,right place with the right budget the,ep062
141,passion of finding a beautiful place,ep062
144,that will be happy and we'll just try to,ep062
147,find the right balance we're on the,ep062
150,fringes of West London here bordering on,ep062
153,Buckinghamshire and it's sort of semi,ep062
156,rural we've got the Grand Union canal,ep062
159,here quite a few lakes and Natural Park,ep062
162,areas but still within an hour of,ep062
165,central London the rental market across,ep062
168,London has slowed down since brexit it's,ep062
171,mainly because of uncertainty it does,ep062
174,mean that it's a little easier for,ep062
177,tenants to get properties that they're,ep062
180,looking for because there's not so much,ep062
183,competition yeah we're looking for a,ep062
186,house or an apartment that is two,ep062
189,bedrooms something that has a nice,ep062
192,spacious kitchen an outdoor space or a,ep062
195,guardian for the kids to play in and I'm,ep062
198,working on a hospital here in Uxbridge,ep062
201,so close to this hospital would be ideal,ep062
204,so do you definitely want to be in,ep062
207,Uxbridge town centre itself ideally,ep062
210,would like to be closer in to central,ep062
213,London that's at least an easy commute,ep062
216,to get to work for me it's important for,ep062
219,me to be on time so you want to try to,ep062
222,benefit from a bit of countryside but,ep062
225,also you want the Metropolitan benefits,ep062
228,of the city yeah,ep062
231,and I would really like it to be some,ep062
234,kind of creative historical or quirky,ep062
237,houses and a lots gonna depend on budget,ep062
240,isn't it so tell me what sort of budget,ep062
243,we're looking at yeah well we're looking,ep062
246,"for $2,000 a month $2,000 a month",ep062
249,mmm Laura and Chad you know they're a,ep062
252,quirky couple and I think they want a,ep062
255,property that reflects that so I'm,ep062
258,really gonna be on the lookout for,ep062
261,"character on this search $2,000 is not a",ep062
264,lot of money I'm curious to see what we,ep062
267,might find going a bit further out into,ep062
270,the sort of more countryside areas,ep062
273,though guys I've brought you to this,ep062
276,lovely village called Chandler's cross,ep062
279,about an hour from central London Wow,ep062
282,well it's a beautiful countryside but,ep062
285,yeah an hour away from London is pretty,ep062
288,far and it's probably about 30 minutes,ep062
291,to the hospital it's a bit of a drive,ep062
294,from your work yeah under budget at,ep062
297,"$1,800 it's actually called the Mission",ep062
300,Church because it's an old church all in,ep062
303,just from the outside it looks really,ep062
306,unique and special so let's go yeah all,ep062
309,right so come on through and tell me,ep062
312,what you think,ep062
315,it's a lie yeah yeah it's face up it was,ep062
318,really nice and airy and open kids I,ep062
321,love it it just feels like a dollhouse,ep062
324,well we went through the door for the,ep062
327,first time it was great just to see all,ep062
330,the light pouring in and all the space,ep062
333,Wow,ep062
336,the kitchen base the kitchen is a little,ep062
339,petite yeah I have to imagine cooking in,ep062
342,here is not much space cook on what yeah,ep062
345,exactly,ep062
348,oh dear you might want to have some,ep062
351,appliances to it yeah yeah you kind of,ep062
354,like extend putting a table out here to,ep062
357,have a little more space for cooking,ep062
360,area and I mean it's got a lot of,ep062
363,character I just don't know how we can,ep062
366,make this work you could also have more,ep062
369,space out here you've got this almost,ep062
372,dance studio over here it's not the,ep062
375,ideal house as far as practicality we'd,ep062
378,have to change a lot with it now the,ep062
381,bathrooms through this way okay guys to,ep062
384,have a look in the bathroom and see what,ep062
387,you think,ep062
390,ah cute enter Hey,ep062
393,well it's very a very nice bathroom but,ep062
396,you know without a bath be difficult for,ep062
399,the kids you know we'll be fine with,ep062
402,this it's very nice looking and I think,ep062
405,it will suit us very well it's separate,ep062
408,the lack of a bath let's head upstairs,ep062
411,now guys see what you think now this is,ep062
414,a very quirky interesting kind of a fun,ep062
417,space for the kid I think they'd love,ep062
420,this I think Chad's looking a bit,ep062
423,ambivalent but you're enjoying the,ep062
426,quirkiness aren't you I think definitely,ep062
429,now this property has an extra little,ep062
432,space come and have a look wow this is,ep062
435,not a studio wonderful because I would,ep062
438,love to set this up this has a wonderful,ep062
441,place for a backdrop it'd also be just a,ep062
444,great place to take the kids and we,ep062
447,could just do art together that sounds,ep062
450,really neat so let me get clear here,ep062
453,Laurie you're completely sold on this,ep062
456,property now are here,ep062
459,it is really interesting I can see why,ep062
462,you like it but I don't know if it's for,ep062
465,me I think if chad is wearing his mr.,ep062
468,sensible hats he's a bit worried about,ep062
471,the impracticality of the kitchen and,ep062
474,he's worried about the fact it only has,ep062
477,one bedroom as it currently stands for,ep062
480,the next property obviously we still,ep062
483,need character Oh beautiful is just like,ep062
486,a gorgeous Victorian Street but I'm,ep062
489,gonna try and get another property that,ep062
492,is a bit more practical you really have,ep062
495,to see it in four days,ep062
498,[Music],ep062
501,Chad and Lara are moving back to England,ep062
504,after twelve years in the States,ep062
507,I think I was about 13 years old I just,ep062
510,got so interested in Victorian fashions,ep062
513,made a full 1880s bustle dress prom let,ep062
516,me try it on if you like yeah but when,ep062
519,we lived in London before we stayed in,ep062
522,the centre we never went out to the,ep062
525,peripheral area and so this is gonna be,ep062
528,a whole new experience now there are a,ep062
531,family of four looking for a home in,ep062
534,West London house number one priority is,ep062
537,going to be close to his work my number,ep062
540,one priority would be something that has,ep062
543,a bit of history or art in the house,ep062
546,design Oh fits you nicely,ep062
549,yeah the hunt began with an old,ep062
552,converted Church hall in Chandler's,ep062
555,cross about an hour from central London,ep062
558,Wow an hour away from London is pretty,ep062
561,far and it's probably about 30 minutes,ep062
564,to the hospital it's a bit of a drive,ep062
567,for your work yeah it's a lovely open,ep062
570,quirky space and it's under budget at,ep062
573,"$1,800 although the kitchen is bare oh",ep062
576,dear you might want to have some,ep062
579,appliances to it and it's one bedroom as,ep062
582,a challenge,ep062
585,[Music],ep062
588,mind you had this okay Lara still sees,ep062
591,potential perfect place for doing with,ep062
594,house 2 richard fine-tunes is strategy,ep062
597,next i'm gonna try and get on property,ep062
600,that is a bit more practical the bit,ep062
603,closer to where Chad works but I wonder,ep062
606,what that kids know well here we already,ep062
609,know this page wholly beautiful is just,ep062
612,like a gorgeous Victorian streets and I,ep062
615,brought you to see this three bed one,ep062
618,bath property is teeming with period,ep062
621,features which you're gonna love Laura,ep062
624,but how far is it to get to central,ep062
627,London probably about an hour well okay,ep062
630,but we're very close to the hospital,ep062
633,excellent that's really good and in fact,ep062
636,I probably and I ride my bicycle to work,ep062
639,now there is one problem with this,ep062
642,"property it is over budget at $2,200",ep062
645,2200,ep062
648,so it might be difficult I'm hoping,ep062
651,that's the location and the period,ep062
654,features and the size of the garden you,ep062
657,know might win you over I'm not talking,ep062
660,about living this far out in Greater,ep062
663,London but I definitely see where it,ep062
666,would appeal to Chad but it kind of,ep062
669,destroys a bit of my dreams of moving to,ep062
672,London so come through guys this is,ep062
675,really nice the stained glass on the,ep062
678,door let's come through to this living,ep062
681,room,ep062
684,that's kind of small oh but look at this,ep062
687,fireplace oh my gosh she saw long ago,ep062
690,this is so pretty,ep062
693,that's really nice a special Wow,ep062
696,the period features are nice but they're,ep062
699,not a necessity for me for me it's about,ep062
702,the practicalities of getting the kids,ep062
705,to school and me getting to work now,ep062
708,let's go through to the master bedroom,ep062
711,okay just through here,ep062
714,oh wow this is nice nice nice and bright,ep062
717,oh it has wardrobes that's good,ep062
720,this is the third bedroom guys yeah yeah,ep062
723,it's a London bedroom for you some,ep062
726,people would see this as a studio now,ep062
729,look at this you've got a really nice,ep062
732,big window in this bathroom so it makes,ep062
735,it nice and lisen Brys it's small it's,ep062
738,nice there's a tub we definitely that's,ep062
741,what we need yes that's good well let's,ep062
744,go through and have a look at the kids,ep062
747,it's a nice big kitchen oh great yeah,ep062
750,this stove you've also got you know all,ep062
753,the appliances you need yeah there's,ep062
756,lots of counter space and lots of,ep062
759,storage it's I think it'd be really nice,ep062
762,to cook in here well we've got a nice,ep062
765,big God now here let's see so do you,ep062
768,think lots of space I could definitely,ep062
771,see Caspian kicking the soccer ball back,ep062
774,here yeah so what do you think of this,ep062
777,house overall then guys it's really,ep062
780,close to where I work it seems to have a,ep062
783,lot of the features that our likes in,ep062
786,the house it does seem to have,ep062
789,everything that we were looking for but,ep062
792,third bedroom is pretty small and again,ep062
795,over budget you know so that's a big,ep062
798,factor for us as well we really have to,ep062
801,see if we can afford it the biggest,ep062
804,challenge is trying to get that,ep062
807,combination of period features in the,ep062
810,right location it's nice and stylish you,ep062
813,know it's the commute for me to go to,ep062
816,work in the morning,ep062
819,I really like it,ep062
822,[Music],ep062
825,oh those great blue want that quote with,ep062
828,London what a man tires of London he's,ep062
831,tired of life there's so much to do here,ep062
834,the crest is the crest of London the,ep062
837,Eventide family is moving to West London,ep062
840,where chad has a new job a really unique,ep062
843,opportunity came up for American trained,ep062
846,physician assistants to work and in the,ep062
849,United Kingdom and Laura sees a,ep062
852,tremendous advantage for Caspian and,ep062
855,little Starling I knew it'd be just,ep062
858,great to have our kids experience the,ep062
861,history culture today in London,ep062
864,especially when it comes to their new,ep062
867,home I would really like it to be some,ep062
870,kind of historical or creative style,ep062
873,yeah you want to learn Caspian see how,ep062
876,all about the juggling so their house,ep062
879,hunt began in an old converted church,ep062
882,hall feels really nice and airy and open,ep062
885,the nice thing about the loft spaces is,ep062
888,very flexible you can do 101 things with,ep062
891,it really I don't know I'm not too keen,ep062
894,on a lot of things about the place house,ep062
897,2 is practically next door to Chad's new,ep062
900,job in Uxbridge,ep062
903,a top priority on his wish list that's,ep062
906,that's what I like about the property is,ep062
909,so close to the hospital and while it's,ep062
912,asking price is a problem it is over,ep062
915,"budget at $2,200 22",ep062
918,it has the unique character and period,ep062
921,features Richard promised fireplace oh,ep062
924,my gosh is so pretty and outdoor play,ep062
927,space for Caspian and his sister I can,ep062
930,definitely see Caspian kicking the,ep062
933,soccer ball back here yeah,ep062
936,[Music],ep062
939,[Laughter],ep062
942,this time around Richard tries to stick,ep062
945,with the charm factor while getting them,ep062
948,a little closer to central London the,ep062
951,great thing about Ealing is with just 30,ep062
954,minutes from central London how long,ep062
957,will it take for me to get to my work 20,ep062
960,to 30 minutes depending on traffic I,ep062
963,think chance to get to work it's about,ep062
966,right in the middle between the two,ep062
969,places we like to be yeah that's true,ep062
972,good I'm glad you like it and I brought,ep062
975,you to see this really nice two-bed,ep062
978,one-bath house,ep062
981,it looks very my style which I really,ep062
984,like you know just from the outside yeah,ep062
987,good I've got more good news because,ep062
990,"it's also on budget at $2,000 so comes",ep062
993,through to the lounge guys all right so,ep062
996,nice through lounge here with this wall,ep062
999,knots down of course,ep062
1002,nice big sofa here and I love the old,ep062
1005,fireplaces this is really cool feels,ep062
1008,very homey it's nice I love the bay,ep062
1011,window getting all that light in here I,ep062
1014,really like it it has the charm that I,ep062
1017,love how it's just so much more,ep062
1020,accessible to get to central London,ep062
1023,it's nice oh I love the granite,ep062
1026,countertops this is really nice gas,ep062
1029,stove great view of the garden my,ep062
1032,cuirass,ep062
1035,ah it's nice and stylish and it looks,ep062
1038,like it has lots of storage and all the,ep062
1041,modern amenities that you could ask for,ep062
1044,so I'm a bit conflicted just cuz I,ep062
1047,really do care about Chad and his,ep062
1050,commute but there's knowing how close it,ep062
1053,is to central London it really appeals,ep062
1056,to me now comes our use of the master,ep062
1059,bedroom ah very nice yeah like this old,ep062
1062,style bed this is fantastic,ep062
1065,yeah feels very nice and comfortable and,ep062
1068,warm in here it has a good feel to it,ep062
1071,okay,ep062
1074,[Music],ep062
1077,it's a bit small for two kids so we,ep062
1080,would need another bed not having an,ep062
1083,extra bedroom with probably no way on me,ep062
1086,over time and the commuting as well this,ep062
1089,is nice nice big bathroom so guys this,ep062
1092,is the garden well it's nice cause,ep062
1095,beautiful flowers lovely I think it'd be,ep062
1098,fun for the kids,ep062
1101,so what do you think of the property,ep062
1104,overall I like a large it has the,ep062
1107,historical charm that I'm looking for,ep062
1110,and location closer to central London,ep062
1113,that's fantastic just my biggest worry,ep062
1116,is being second bedroom being so small,ep062
1119,Elsa you know it's the commute for me to,ep062
1122,go to work in the morning and come home,ep062
1125,so you know might be you know that's why,ep062
1128,it's a downside for me yeah overall,ep062
1131,there really I like I really like it,ep062
1134,quirky loft space and Chandler's cross a,ep062
1137,three bedroom close to Chad's work or a,ep062
1140,home just 30 minutes from central London,ep062
1143,I know which one I want well I'm a bit,ep062
1146,torn,ep062
1149,[Music],ep062
1152,so you excited by it starting your new,ep062
1155,job,ep062
1158,yeah this feels so good to be back here,ep062
1161,12 years ago Chad and Lara were students,ep062
1164,in London but now things have changed,ep062
1167,yeah we can't do the studio flat like we,ep062
1170,used to do when Isis Lara and I now as,ep062
1173,kids we need you know more space more,ep062
1176,bedrooms with son Caspian and daughter,ep062
1179,Starling they're moving to West London,ep062
1182,where Chad will be a physician assistant,ep062
1185,in the UK's National Health Service I'm,ep062
1188,working on a hospital here in Uxbridge,ep062
1191,so close to this hospital be ideal house,ep062
1194,one is distant from Chadsworth probably,ep062
1197,about 30 minutes to the hospital it's a,ep062
1200,bit of a drive from your work yeah and,ep062
1203,twice as far from the history and,ep062
1206,architecture of central London yeah the,ep062
1209,first thing that I would like to do is,ep062
1212,take the kids are the different museums,ep062
1215,and places that we're just really,ep062
1218,enjoyed but the old refurbished church,ep062
1221,hall immediately caught Lara's eye,ep062
1224,perfect place for doing some well I told,ep062
1227,open it was and having it be in the,ep062
1230,country I think it'd be really nice for,ep062
1233,the kids to enjoy the nature but I think,ep062
1236,remote to it I don't know if we wanted,ep062
1239,that kind of lifestyle house 2 is close,ep062
1242,to Chad's work in Uxbridge,ep062
1245,excellent that's really good and in fact,ep062
1248,I probably and I ride my bicycle to work,ep062
1251,a spacious three-bedroom home but over,ep062
1254,budget by $200 a month I like a lot it,ep062
1257,has a lot more space and all the,ep062
1260,historical details look at this,ep062
1263,fireplace oh my gosh niveau this is so,ep062
1266,pretty in that garden that ahead in the,ep062
1269,back is really nice I could definitely,ep062
1272,see cast being kicking a soccer ball,ep062
1275,back here,ep062
1278,I just really worry about the budget,ep062
1281,yeah house three and Ealing is on budget,ep062
1284,it looks very my style which I really,ep062
1287,like and midway between Huck's bridge,ep062
1290,and central London it is charming from,ep062
1293,the outside nice family neighborhood but,ep062
1296,living space is a problem a bit small,ep062
1299,for two kids though and we would need,ep062
1302,another bed,ep062
1305,[Music],ep062
1308,what do you think about the Ealing house,ep062
1311,30 minutes drive to work maybe longer,ep062
1314,depending on traffic probably my least,ep062
1317,favorite of the three day we saw yeah,ep062
1320,having the second bedroom being really,ep062
1323,small I I do wonder but how we make that,ep062
1326,work,ep062
1329,I think we should probably take that one,ep062
1332,off our list agreed what do you think,ep062
1335,about that blue house well I liked how,ep062
1338,open it was and it was the only place,ep062
1341,that we looked at that was his own house,ep062
1344,too far away from what we need to be,ep062
1347,close to do you think about the one,ep062
1350,close to my work though I just really,ep062
1353,worry about the budget because it is,ep062
1356,over budget I love how it's just less,ep062
1359,than a mile away from my work the blue,ep062
1362,house I like it a lot it it's beautiful,ep062
1365,it has charm I mean there's so many,ep062
1368,different features I really enjoyed,ep062
1371,there it was good with the budget yeah,ep062
1374,but yeah there are a lot of drawbacks to,ep062
1377,like one bedroom that's there if you can,ep062
1380,call it that we'd have to establish a,ep062
1383,place for ourselves to sleep downstairs,ep062
1386,a kitchen I don't think is workable you,ep062
1389,know in this current state we'd have to,ep062
1392,invest in that I think that even though,ep062
1395,we'd be saving money with the rent be,ep062
1398,paying a lot more in other ways too yes,ep062
1401,I feel like like I'm really leaning,ep062
1404,towards someone close to my work that,ep062
1407,sounds like you like this place,ep062
1410,what oh I do actually really felt like I,ep062
1413,was home when I was looking around that,ep062
1416,one well I'm a bit torn but I think I've,ep062
1419,decided as well I mean priorities have,ep062
1422,changed lot since we've had kids and I,ep062
1425,think this is definitely the best house,ep062
1428,for our family right now it's a,ep062
1431,different time in our life and this will,ep062
1434,be the right decision,ep062
1437,[Music],ep062
1440,it's been really good actually being on,ep062
1443,the edge of the countryside and enjoying,ep062
1446,that part of England that we didn't know,ep062
1449,before,ep062
1452,first one great the hospital workout is,ep062
1455,really friendly everyone's been open to,ep062
1458,me coming to help them nice to meet you,ep062
1461,my name's Chad Eventide I'm a physician,ep062
1464,assistant here listen to your heart now,ep062
1467,okay and I constantly very close I'm,ep062
1470,doing alterations how's it fitting feel,ep062
1473,sexy and it's just really great to be,ep062
1476,sewing again you've done a good job oh I,ep062
1479,love me parts about the house I love the,ep062
1482,fireplaces and I love having this,ep062
1485,enormous kitchen that I can just have so,ep062
1488,much fun cooking and this was definitely,ep062
1491,the Victorian style home I was hoping,ep062
1494,for tea,ep062
1497,yeah when the weather's great we'll,ep062
1500,spend a lot of time in the back garden,ep062
1503,so your check has food loves to play,ep062
1506,basketball and Starling loves to play in,ep062
1509,the mud if I could describe life here,ep062
1512,with one word it would be possibilities,ep062
1515,I just love seeing how much is being,ep062
1518,added to our children's lives and what,ep062
1521,might turn into in the future,ep062
1524,you,ep062
12,[Music],ep063
15,the water sniffle yeah Kendra and Mikkel,ep063
18,have made the best of their,ep063
21,long-distance relationship it's not like,ep063
24,in California with big waves and with,ep063
27,the move to his native Denmark dark,ep063
30,she's hoping their bond will grow even,ep063
33,stronger but they'll need to work out a,ep063
36,few kinks along the way this apartment,ep063
39,definitely not that close to major it's,ep063
42,perfect,ep063
45,Kendra and I pretty stubborn you feel a,ep063
48,little bit more out of the city being,ep063
51,here I think it's nice,ep063
54,[Music],ep063
57,our communication can sometimes get lost,ep063
60,a little bit second bedroom is quite,ep063
63,small but let's wait and see what else,ep063
66,we see another part that's gonna be a,ep063
69,challenge,ep063
72,[Music],ep063
75,I hear you're moving to Denmark yeah so,ep063
78,I am from California and I've lived here,ep063
81,for most of my life are you excited to,ep063
84,finally like move in and live with,ep063
87,Michael yes Michael and I met in 2014 we,ep063
90,both were in Nicaragua,ep063
93,she was volunteer teaching English and I,ep063
96,was out traveling and we've been doing,ep063
99,long distance between California and,ep063
102,Denmark about every two months and we're,ep063
105,a little tired of it what are you doing,ep063
108,here well I'm selling different kinds of,ep063
111,smoothies we picked all who's mainly,ep063
114,because I I'm going to school here but,ep063
117,how does I have my own company get on,ep063
120,the seat all right,ep063
123,I mean start biking Kendra was open to,ep063
126,move here to see if he's gonna bring us,ep063
129,more together,ep063
132,are there a lot of yoga studios in,ep063
135,Aarhus there's a few so I think it would,ep063
138,be really nice to create a small yoga,ep063
141,studio in the apartment they have to,ep063
144,think about that when you find a place -,ep063
147,yeah,ep063
150,we are it'll be fun to see how daily,ep063
153,life works and what our new dynamic will,ep063
156,be I love you so much,ep063
159,she doesn't know what she's jumping into,ep063
162,with yoga business but at the same time,ep063
165,I think she's open-minded and curious to,ep063
168,see what is this like living with me in,ep063
171,Denmark so I'm really hoping that it's,ep063
174,gonna go well,ep063
177,always is Denmark's second biggest city,ep063
180,but you can easily ride your bike or,ep063
183,walk around always actually used to be a,ep063
186,very big trade city because of the big,ep063
189,harbour that we got here now people are,ep063
192,actually coming here for school hey guys,ep063
195,I'm Patrick Denmark's rental cap makes,ep063
198,housing more affordable but doesn't,ep063
201,necessarily make the choices easy,ep063
204,we're hoping to get at least two,ep063
207,bedrooms and I teach yoga so I am,ep063
210,looking for extra room or space yeah I,ep063
213,can have a livelihood from it and it,ep063
216,would be a nice way for me to start my,ep063
219,own community in Aarhus as well and I,ep063
222,know light is really important to,ep063
225,Michael I'm not so sure about it because,ep063
228,it's light right now but he,ep063
231,that's really important no it is we do,ep063
234,have really dark winters so if you wake,ep063
237,up at 7 o'clock it's still dark and it's,ep063
240,dark when you come home from work at,ep063
243,around 4 o'clock so light is extremely,ep063
246,significant for me to be able to like,ep063
249,keep the mood up even though it's winter,ep063
252,I'm very interested in being somewhere,ep063
255,close to downtown so we stay connected,ep063
258,to the city I think it's really,ep063
261,important to be inner nature I need the,ep063
264,water and I need the forest and the,ep063
267,trees both Kendra and I pretty stubborn,ep063
270,I don't know how that's gonna go when we,ep063
273,live together I think it might drive me,ep063
276,crazy so what you guys budget we're,ep063
279,thinking around $1300 money is a little,ep063
282,tight until I start teaching yoga so,ep063
285,it's really important for me to not go,ep063
288,over budget,ep063
291,depends on how nice is it's easy to sell,ep063
294,that they not gonna agree on everything,ep063
297,but that worries me a little bit Patrick,ep063
300,hopes Kendra is tempted by downtown's,ep063
303,bigger yoga client pool but Mikkel still,ep063
306,needs to talk her into city living this,ep063
309,apartment is in the very heart of all,ep063
312,who's it's like five minutes from the,ep063
315,bars and all that yeah it's perfect,ep063
318,well the apartment is a two-bedroom,ep063
321,"one-bathroom and it's only $1,200 a",ep063
324,month oh that's great mmm but it's,ep063
327,definitely not that close to major it,ep063
330,might be a little loud but when we get,ep063
333,in the apartment you will get the,ep063
336,feeling how it's gonna be when the,ep063
339,windows are closed come on in guys this,ep063
342,is so nice it's a new and renovated,ep063
345,kitchen that is nice and bright and,ep063
348,that's yeah it's open you know that's I,ep063
351,like that so here we have the bathroom,ep063
354,this is really great there's so much,ep063
357,storage in here two showerheads,ep063
360,that's a cool feature yeah let's go take,ep063
363,a look at the first bedroom it's pretty,ep063
366,small I mean it fits a bed in here like,ep063
369,like a double,ep063
372,mmm might be kind of tight but you,ep063
375,wouldn't need more let's take a look at,ep063
378,the master bedroom yeah this is huge,ep063
381,that's cool the neighbors though you can,ep063
384,see right to them this doesn't look like,ep063
387,my ideal location I don't really see any,ep063
390,space to lay out and relax this Togo,ep063
393,take a look at the living room yes and,ep063
396,the light comes in right here because,ep063
399,this is so I really like that,ep063
402,Kendra let's try to see if we can find a,ep063
405,room for you as well,ep063
408,okay there's space for a nice small,ep063
411,class in here should be able to fit,ep063
414,eight nine people in here or something,ep063
417,Mikal is pretty excited about this,ep063
420,apartment but I would really love a,ep063
423,little more space for me to do yoga and,ep063
426,where we're both happy definitely small,ep063
429,squeezin I mean that's what you get when,ep063
432,you're downtown I really want Kendra to,ep063
435,feel at home here but I think that she's,ep063
438,gonna have to get used to the city,ep063
441,because it's definitely different than,ep063
444,it is in California here we have the,ep063
447,courtyard where you will be able to get,ep063
450,outside a little bit it's green it's,ep063
453,beautiful to look at but it's not really,ep063
456,maybe a space we would hang out in I,ep063
459,mean the stillness and benches over,ep063
462,there,ep063
465,second ouais in the city anything that's,ep063
468,pretty I really like that it's a big,ep063
471,spacious apartment and I really like,ep063
474,that it gets a lot of natural light,ep063
477,there's room to teach yoga in and feel,ep063
480,like that it's under budget I'm happy,ep063
483,there's a balcony but it is pretty small,ep063
486,but the location it's pretty much what I,ep063
489,had in mind,ep063
492,yeah but it's not really in nature it's,ep063
495,very much in the city I think it kind of,ep063
498,blows my mind,ep063
501,[Music],ep063
504,Patrick gets Kendra closer to nature you,ep063
507,feel a little bit more out of the city,ep063
510,being here but mikkel isn't giving up on,ep063
513,city living just yet,ep063
516,you our city won't really do that trick,ep063
519,for me it's okay oh who suits Kendra,ep063
522,nice lifestyle because it's really,ep063
525,active there's a lot of outdoor activity,ep063
528,there's a lot of nice for us so it kind,ep063
531,of just sums up the way that we like to,ep063
534,live Kendra and Mikkel are upgrading,ep063
537,their long-distance status to full-time,ep063
540,cohabitants in Mickle's native Denmark,ep063
543,Kendra moving to California is obviously,ep063
546,quite the challenge because she has to,ep063
549,create a business and life here and I,ep063
552,think that it's gonna be difficult for,ep063
555,some paths yes I he has a life set up,ep063
558,for him already,ep063
561,he has his school program he has his,ep063
564,life pretty much planned and for me,ep063
567,everything's brand new having access to,ep063
570,nature being close to nature that's,ep063
573,really important to me because it would,ep063
576,be really nice teaching yoga in a home,ep063
579,that we can relax him and also I just,ep063
582,need to get out of city life sometimes,ep063
585,they both know they're stubborn so it's,ep063
588,no surprise heads are already butting,ep063
591,over house 1 this apartment is in the,ep063
594,very heart of all who's that it's,ep063
597,perfect there's a lot of people it's a,ep063
600,little noisy I mean that's what you get,ep063
603,when you're downtown it's a big spacious,ep063
606,apartment and I really like that it gets,ep063
609,a lot of natural life but I would like a,ep063
612,place where we're both happy I really,ep063
615,like that there's room to teach yoga and,ep063
618,and that's under budget but it's not,ep063
621,really in nature I think it kind of,ep063
624,blows my mind,ep063
627,[Music],ep063
630,Patrick knows Kendra would rather Center,ep063
633,her yoga business in a calm natural,ep063
636,setting,ep063
639,so he's picked a property that will,ep063
642,summon the right mood even if that means,ep063
645,missing on location for mikkel this,ep063
648,apartment is the nature apartment so,ep063
651,that's definitely gonna be something for,ep063
654,you yeah I like the street there are a,ep063
657,lot of trees here it's beautiful and,ep063
660,pretty quiet and you're right next to,ep063
663,the water and the park that's perfect,ep063
666,this is further out than I actually want,ep063
669,it to be but hopefully you'll still,ep063
672,consider this it's a two-bedroom,ep063
675,one-bathroom but it's a little bit over,ep063
678,your budget it's $1400 a month hmm we'll,ep063
681,have to really see if it's worth it all,ep063
684,right guys come on in,ep063
687,[Music],ep063
690,just come on in here you have the,ep063
693,bathroom oh it's great and some storage,ep063
696,that's nice sing it this is nice cool I,ep063
699,like the lighting that's super nice,ep063
702,maybe we would need a little less stuff,ep063
705,in here maybe plenty of room for me to,ep063
708,have some people over and teach them,ep063
711,yeah I really like this view and you,ep063
714,feel a little bit more out of the city,ep063
717,being here you are sensitive yes I like,ep063
720,that I think it's maybe was putting a,ep063
723,lot of pressure on me to be close to the,ep063
726,center of the city but I want to feel a,ep063
729,sense of comfort into the apartment oh,ep063
732,this is nice master bedroom it's not,ep063
735,that picture what is it look at how big,ep063
738,the bed is yeah well that's not a really,ep063
741,space for you yeah all right yeah you,ep063
744,like the bedroom,ep063
747,yeah you not so much I guess well let me,ep063
750,take you to see the kitchen then yeah,ep063
753,pretty sure you both got like that,ep063
756,this is nice yeah good big spacious,ep063
759,kitchen I like that lots of light coming,ep063
762,in those 10 it's like an indoor outdoor,ep063
765,space kind of that's really great,ep063
768,yeah it also has a small bedroom,ep063
771,actually oh wow,ep063
774,it is small it's quite cramped yeah yeah,ep063
777,maybe we could get a fold-out couch,ep063
780,I think if Kendra had it her way we'll,ep063
783,be living in a tree house in the park,ep063
786,somewhere but won't really do that trait,ep063
789,for me it's okay yes wow this is great,ep063
792,this is amazing it's such a big balcony,ep063
795,could have six people out here barbecue,ep063
798,look at that courtyard it's amazing how,ep063
801,much grass I can teach a small yoga,ep063
804,class outside in the summer that's cool,ep063
807,that's perfect,ep063
810,I really like that it's near the two,ep063
813,parks and it's quiet and calm over here,ep063
816,it's a really nice neighborhood I think,ep063
819,I absolutely love the balcony and I love,ep063
822,the courtyard I enjoy the balcony so,ep063
825,much and I love the kitchen like I like,ep063
828,that there's so much light coming in but,ep063
831,it's not downtown and it's not that big,ep063
834,I think we could make the small room,ep063
837,work but budget we also have fun yeah,ep063
840,that's right Patrick thinks he has a way,ep063
843,to end the standoff it's very close to a,ep063
846,lot of green area and very close to the,ep063
849,city as well,ep063
852,yeah this is nice hmm that's gonna be a,ep063
855,challenge how do you like this peach,ep063
858,it's beautiful the waters fearful Kendra,ep063
861,and Mickle's six thousand mile long,ep063
864,distance relationship stood the test of,ep063
867,time it's not like in California with,ep063
870,waves but now they're ready to settle,ep063
873,down under the same roof and build a,ep063
876,life together in his native Denmark,ep063
879,Kendra is very dear to me obviously,ep063
882,that's the reason we dated even though,ep063
885,we live so far away from each other,ep063
888,wanna race nope I've been together with,ep063
891,Mikkel for about two and a half years,ep063
894,and I do think this is a big turning,ep063
897,point in our relationship little theory,ep063
900,this is our chance to see how our,ep063
903,relationship is going to develop and,ep063
906,grow we can put our feet in at the water,ep063
909,come on and what it's like to be,ep063
912,together more than just every two months,ep063
915,Nicole ISM Oh it'll be a brand new,ep063
918,dynamic for us and we're excited to see,ep063
921,what happens,ep063
924,yeah Kendra and I agree on a lot of,ep063
927,stuff but there's also obviously some,ep063
930,things where we have a different opinion,ep063
933,I really like this view and you feel a,ep063
936,little bit more out of the city being,ep063
939,here you are seven city we try to,ep063
942,communicate as much as possible be,ep063
945,plenty of room for me to do practice or,ep063
948,have some people over and teach them but,ep063
951,if we disagree or we don't see eye to,ep063
954,eye on something our communication can,ep063
957,sometimes get lost a little bit it's not,ep063
960,downtown and it's not that big I think,ep063
963,we could make the small room work but,ep063
966,budget we also have that yeah that's,ep063
969,right it seems like the biggest problem,ep063
972,is where they want to live,ep063
975,Eero rice patrick hopes a place that,ep063
978,blends affordability with a natural,ep063
981,backdrop for Kendra's yoga business will,ep063
984,finally seal the deal,ep063
987,so this next apartment is the Riverside,ep063
990,apartment I think is something that you,ep063
993,both gonna enjoy it's like three minutes,ep063
996,walk from downtown and it's actually,ep063
999,right behind a technical garden as well,ep063
1002,it's a tupid one bathroom so the,ep063
1005,location seems perfect but I'm a little,ep063
1008,concerned about the price well that's,ep063
1011,actually the good thing about it it's,ep063
1014,right on your budget,ep063
1017,that's something you can that sounds,ep063
1020,really good mm-hmm yeah okay guys come,ep063
1023,on in this is so nice and then we,ep063
1026,actually have the bathroom right here oh,ep063
1029,wow second bedroom is quite small yeah,ep063
1032,but let's wait and see what else we see,ep063
1035,I'm a little concerned with space I feel,ep063
1038,like we could be a little bit on top of,ep063
1041,each other here and I think it's,ep063
1044,important for us to both have room to,ep063
1047,breathe oh this is cute yeah it's cozy,ep063
1050,mm-hmm hmm there's not that much light,ep063
1053,coming in but we'll get the Morning Sun,ep063
1056,when it comes up here and then you'll,ep063
1059,get the afternoon in the latest on out,ep063
1062,on the river sighs with the darkness and,ep063
1065,the coldness in the winter that's gonna,ep063
1068,be a challenge yeah nice yeah the,ep063
1071,kitchen and living room combined hmm but,ep063
1074,I think it's pretty cozy this space I,ep063
1077,really do wish we had two separate,ep063
1080,spaces for hanging out and then doing,ep063
1083,yoga yeah,ep063
1086,[Music],ep063
1089,mmm this is perfect this is nice and,ep063
1092,vacant yeah it's big it has a beautiful,ep063
1095,view look at that green space it's,ep063
1098,fantastic it's a cool hangout spot but I,ep063
1101,get the feeling that this apartment,ep063
1104,might not be as big as you guys has,ep063
1107,hoped yeah there isn't actually a,ep063
1110,separate space for yoga and the light,ep063
1113,it's not as open as we could have hoped,ep063
1116,for but I think the location is perfect,ep063
1119,I think the location is something you,ep063
1122,can't criticize it and I'm really happy,ep063
1125,that it's right on budget so I think it,ep063
1128,could still possibly work,ep063
1131,I think the downtown is a good fit for,ep063
1134,our lifestyle but being my nature would,ep063
1137,make me really happy,ep063
1140,mmm,ep063
1143,oh yeah it's nice yeah Kendra and Mikkel,ep063
1146,are ditching long distance and going,ep063
1149,full-time in his native Denmark I want,ep063
1152,our new apartment to look like this,ep063
1155,oh yeah but they're hitting a wall when,ep063
1158,it comes to where in Aarhus the next,ep063
1161,chapter of their relationship should,ep063
1164,start the probably needs to start,ep063
1167,talking about what we saw today yeah,ep063
1170,that's right Mikkel wants to be in the,ep063
1173,heart of the action but kandra's hoping,ep063
1176,to teach yoga and the atmosphere here in,ep063
1179,the city centre is anything but Zen,ep063
1182,there's a lot of people I mean that's,ep063
1185,what you get when you're downtown it was,ep063
1188,nicely located it was big and bright I,ep063
1191,"really like that it's $1,200 per month",ep063
1194,under budget that's perfect,ep063
1197,but the balconies a little small and,ep063
1200,it's not surrounded by a lot of nature,ep063
1203,the natural setting of house 2 would be,ep063
1206,better for Kendra's business but there's,ep063
1209,a problem it's surrounded by trees and,ep063
1212,parks and that courtyard is amazing at,ep063
1215,"$1,400 per month it was over budget and",ep063
1218,it was not that Vickie and I didn't,ep063
1221,really like the area feel a little bit,ep063
1224,more out of the city being here you are,ep063
1227,I would say yes,ep063
1230,I like that house threes location,ep063
1233,bridges the divide or so it seems,ep063
1236,I like the compromise it has a nice big,ep063
1239,balcony with green area yeah a river the,ep063
1242,grass that was so great it wasn't that,ep063
1245,bright though no and it wasn't that big,ep063
1248,no there isn't,ep063
1251,actually a separate space for yoga and,ep063
1254,the light that's not as openness with,ep063
1257,hopeful,ep063
1260,[Music],ep063
1263,what are you thinking I mean the nature,ep063
1266,apartment to be honest with you I didn't,ep063
1269,really like that it was that far out of,ep063
1272,town I think the nature is perfect I,ep063
1275,love the balcony but it's over budget so,ep063
1278,I'm a little worried about that yeah,ep063
1281,okay so we agree,ep063
1284,no no no need your apartment no so what,ep063
1287,do you think about the downtown,ep063
1290,apartment I really like it it's so big,ep063
1293,and spacious it's downtown it's nice and,ep063
1296,light but the balcony is a little small,ep063
1299,the courtyard isn't really a place where,ep063
1302,I could see myself hanging out and there,ep063
1305,isn't a lot of nature surrounding the,ep063
1308,apartment,ep063
1311,the Riverside one location was amazing,ep063
1314,and I do like the price at this bread on,ep063
1317,budget but for the winter it didn't seem,ep063
1320,that light so it could be kind of a dark,ep063
1323,place to be trapped it is a little small,ep063
1326,there isn't a separate space for me,ep063
1329,through yoga inside but if we do the,ep063
1332,downtown apartment I really think that,ep063
1335,it's nice that it's so big and it's not,ep063
1338,that far from a very nice forestation,ep063
1341,and it's one of the most beautiful,ep063
1344,forest homes so I'll be on the same page,ep063
1347,the downtown apartment the green space,ep063
1350,isn't that nice like and the balcony is,ep063
1353,pretty small,ep063
1356,[Music],ep063
1359,I'm willing to give it a chance because,ep063
1362,I am pretty excited about that much,ep063
1365,space there's a yoga room for me which,ep063
1368,is great and the fact that it's under,ep063
1371,budget is a huge relief,ep063
1374,I think you've won me over yes near whom,ep063
1377,this is the note one first,ep063
1380,I'm really excited to be here in Auvers,ep063
1383,it's so beautiful here yeah we are super,ep063
1386,close to the forest and the water so,ep063
1389,it's really good getting outside it's,ep063
1392,really jungle II it's super month and,ep063
1395,now we actually get to be together which,ep063
1398,is pretty awesome,ep063
1401,we should make some cabbage tomato what,ep063
1404,else do you want in al-qaeda I was a,ep063
1407,little concerned about this apartment,ep063
1410,with the lack of green space surrounding,ep063
1413,it but I really love the space in the,ep063
1416,apartment how do you say avocado in,ep063
1419,Danish evocate oh we're still working on,ep063
1422,getting everything we want it's feeling,ep063
1425,pretty cozy like home,ep063
1428,we have two separate living spaces so,ep063
1431,for teaching yoga classes in this space,ep063
1434,I have everything set up and I'm ready,ep063
1437,to go isn't it so nice that we don't,ep063
1440,have to travel anymore to see each other,ep063
1443,yeah heavy Kendra here is so nice like,ep063
1446,we're on vacation but we don't have to,ep063
1449,go anywhere,ep063
1452,yes you have to be together and,ep063
1455,experience a normal kind of life I think,ep063
1458,we're really happy about that,ep063
1461,you,ep063
12,oh this is nice Wow with a baby on the,ep064
15,way,ep064
18,Sabrina and Jamil are looking to get,ep064
21,into a bigger place in Montclair New,ep064
24,Jersey but in their price range more,ep064
27,space might be hard to come by but while,ep064
30,she wants to convince him that they need,ep064
33,a cozy family home I love the Cape,ep064
36,cod-style this is really great,ep064
39,he's trying to persuade her on a condo,ep064
42,[Music],ep064
45,she also wants a fixer well he insists,ep064
48,on move-in ready baby he just pushed,ep064
51,this wall out is knock it out absolutely,ep064
54,not this is our bed,ep064
57,[Music],ep064
60,today I'm Sabrina I'm the Environmental,ep064
63,Health and Safety Manager for a media,ep064
66,company,ep064
69,yeah actually let me try he twisted,ep064
72,coconut I'm Jamil and I am a compliance,ep064
75,manager for a manufacturing company they,ep064
78,met in college it was kind of like a,ep064
81,teacher-student a good thing because he,ep064
84,was like a tutor yeah kind of helping,ep064
87,her out we've been together for 11 years,ep064
90,and we've been married two of those,ep064
93,years I think mine better we live in,ep064
96,downtown Jersey City right now we live,ep064
99,in an old pencil factory that was,ep064
102,converted into condominiums our,ep064
105,apartments really tiny I would say 500,ep064
108,square feet yeah that's really cute if,ep064
111,it's a girl,ep064
114,and now 500 square feet isn't going to,ep064
117,cut it since they have a baby on the way,ep064
120,so they're on the hunt for a larger,ep064
123,place we were approved for six hundred,ep064
126,fifty thousand for our home however we,ep064
129,do not want to get anywhere close to,ep064
132,that our budget for us is four hundred,ep064
135,thousand we wanted to keep the mortgage,ep064
138,manageable and maintain our lifestyle,ep064
141,we'd like to travel I had a really big,ep064
144,goal of reaching all seven continents,ep064
147,and we finally achieved that this year,ep064
150,we just came back from Antarctica in,ep064
153,February so that was the last one we'll,ep064
156,need even more funds to travel with the,ep064
159,third person exactly well what do you,ep064
162,think about standalone houses I mean I'm,ep064
165,used to growing up in a standalone home,ep064
168,with a little yard space possibly a dog,ep064
171,I don't know man about no dogs about my,ep064
174,preference would be a townhome but I,ep064
177,would be okay with a condominium we're,ep064
180,gonna buy a house why would we want to,ep064
183,share a wall with someone true I'm just,ep064
186,not ready to be to endure all the,ep064
189,maintenance associated with standalone,ep064
192,house I don't want to replace shingles I,ep064
195,don't want to replace boilers and love a,ep064
198,colonial something very cozy it just,ep064
201,gives a certain type of traditional,ep064
204,charm I'm almost the complete opposite I,ep064
207,like the modern curb appeal simple is,ep064
210,better,ep064
213,moving ready I don't want to lift a,ep064
216,finger,ep064
219,a little open to just maybe like little,ep064
222,fixes to just customize it but Jamal was,ep064
225,just you know not for it nope I am,ep064
228,really tired of eating on the couch so I,ep064
231,need a dining room with chairs so if,ep064
234,that's not in the place then it's gonna,ep064
237,be a no-go she also wants an,ep064
240,open-concept kitchen Jamal this is so,ep064
243,frustrating,ep064
246,we don't need a big kitchen but we,ep064
249,definitely need more space than we have,ep064
252,now in the kitchen and sorry I love a,ep064
255,bigger bathroom,ep064
258,we're always on top of each other,ep064
261,Sabrina also wants a nice laundry room,ep064
264,but it might be a bigger need for Jamil,ep064
267,you know yeah I'm the one that does the,ep064
270,laundry in that so you know we don't,ep064
273,have a washer and dryer in the place so,ep064
276,he said that's fine I'll do the laundry,ep064
279,and so that says task now is to do the,ep064
282,laundry that's why they're focusing,ep064
285,their search on one of their favorite,ep064
288,neighborhoods near their current place,ep064
291,ready for some prenatal yoga stretching,ep064
294,we're looking in Montclair for a house,ep064
297,because it's really close to Manhattan,ep064
300,is a quick train ride away there's also,ep064
303,a lot of shops and restaurants and we,ep064
306,love to stay in a walkable area perfect,ep064
309,for our lifestyle right now really feel,ep064
312,that support from each other,ep064
315,I'm looking forward to space the most in,ep064
318,this next place I don't mind you know,ep064
321,first being so close I love you however,ep064
324,we do need you know to be able to,ep064
327,breathe that would be probably enough,ep064
330,for me so this is a decent neighborhood,ep064
333,first up a standalone house for Sabrina,ep064
336,that's walking distance to downtown I,ep064
339,think that this house is over a hundred,ep064
342,years old it looks that way not too fine,ep064
345,about the curb appeal but hopefully it's,ep064
348,nice inside hi everybody,ep064
351,how are you good so we have a,ep064
354,three-bedroom two-bath vintage cottage,ep064
357,"about 1,300 square feet listed at 399",ep064
360,well that's that's at the top of our,ep064
363,price range so I know that but it needs,ep064
366,nothing that's kind of pushing it but it,ep064
369,is a standalone yeah I'll keep an open,ep064
372,mind I know that Sabrina really likes,ep064
375,the idea of a vintage home that has,ep064
378,character and I understand that Jamila,ep064
381,not so much however I wanted to give him,ep064
384,the idea of what it was like to live in,ep064
387,an old house especially a bright one,ep064
390,like this nice little sunroof yeah I,ep064
393,actually like this so somewhere we can,ep064
396,hang out and feel like you're outside,ep064
399,you can see our neighbors oh yeah so,ep064
402,here's my living room,ep064
405,wow it's a little tight I was looking,ep064
408,for the open concept and at this point I,ep064
411,don't know where the kitchen is so you,ep064
414,could take down this wall and that,ep064
417,sounds like your renovation so so let's,ep064
420,look at the kitchen it's very cute okay,ep064
423,the kitchen is updated it's definitely,ep064
426,more functional than the one we have now,ep064
429,all right we have to do the test can we,ep064
432,open a refrigerator and then a stove at,ep064
435,the same time the oven yeah and you know,ep064
438,when you're cooking you can always put,ep064
441,things on this counter yeah there's the,ep064
444,open-concept you needed that's this this,ep064
447,is it that's it not exactly what I was,ep064
450,looking for but it will do it's a,ep064
453,standalone house I've always dreamed of,ep064
456,having at least,ep064
459,dining room table and I don't think we,ep064
462,could fit that in here,ep064
465,it may be an issue they head downstairs,ep064
468,to check out the basement I can barely,ep064
471,get down,ep064
474,I didn't you remember limbo we are su,ep064
477,duck I feel like I'm like seven feet,ep064
480,tall,ep064
483,down there in that basement watch my,ep064
486,head I'm five seven there is a full bath,ep064
489,down here has a shower,ep064
492,oh very bright okay so you do have a,ep064
495,laundry great you don't have to go and,ep064
498,share something with other people as,ep064
501,long as I don't hit my head on,ep064
504,everything down here so they head,ep064
507,upstairs to see the bedrooms the first,ep064
510,bedroom is the master oh it's a little,ep064
513,tiny what size bed is this ah this is a,ep064
516,queen it's a decent size but it's still,ep064
519,smaller than what we have fun let's look,ep064
522,at that room too,ep064
525,it would be perfect for a nursery yes I,ep064
528,would agree with it the third bedroom is,ep064
531,right next door okay,ep064
534,a little bigger we can knock this wall,ep064
537,out and make this our master bedroom and,ep064
540,make the other room the nurse absolutely,ep064
543,or we can not do any renovations and,ep064
546,it's the same way next they see the,ep064
549,upstairs bathroom actually yeah yeah I,ep064
552,like it yeah so do I I definitely like,ep064
555,the style of the house I would say it,ep064
558,definitely has character the character,ep064
561,doesn't give the home the functionality,ep064
564,that we want this house isn't really my,ep064
567,style that like more of the modern and,ep064
570,contemporary look I really like the yard,ep064
573,at least I can have somewhere where I,ep064
576,can garden it's a lot of work right and,ep064
579,we are already talking about doing more,ep064
582,renovations and it's at the top of our,ep064
585,budget so if it were move-in-ready and,ep064
588,we didn't have to do anything maybe I,ep064
591,maybe I think about I think that this,ep064
594,home might,ep064
597,provide for what we both want but he,ep064
600,just doesn't see it yet I'm I'm more so,ep064
603,interested in and maybe seeing a condo,ep064
606,something with less maintenance,ep064
609,so next their agents lined up a place,ep064
612,with Jamil in mind it does have a roof,ep064
615,garden and the price we'll see I guess,ep064
618,[Music],ep064
621,you think everything's cute with a baby,ep064
624,on the way,ep064
627,Sabrina and Jamil are on the hunt for a,ep064
630,home in Montclair New Jersey within,ep064
633,"their $400,000 budget Sabrina wants to",ep064
636,bring their baby home to a vintage,ep064
639,single-family home while Jamil prefers a,ep064
642,low-maintenance townhouse or condo,ep064
645,they've seen a 100 year old house for,ep064
648,her,ep064
651,now it's Jameel Stern so this is a,ep064
654,downtown Montclair condo it's listed at,ep064
657,three thirty two bedrooms one bath two,ep064
660,blocks to downtown one bathroom but it,ep064
663,is walkable and the price everything has,ep064
666,been renovated okay when Roberto said,ep064
669,it's listed at 330 that's 70 thousand,ep064
672,dollars less than what we want to spend,ep064
675,so you can't really beat that it does,ep064
678,have a roof garden okay all right have a,ep064
681,outdoor space,ep064
684,we'll see walking up I think that it is,ep064
687,a really pretty block not too sure about,ep064
690,the building yeah this is really nice,ep064
693,it's just over a thousand square feet,ep064
696,don't win time I know I think our full,ep064
699,apartment could fit like right look your,ep064
702,outdoor space oh yes this is awesome,ep064
705,still walkable I'm not you yeah there's,ep064
708,no street noise we're not on a Main,ep064
711,Street so this is really good a big plus,ep064
714,is the terrace this provides exactly,ep064
717,what I was looking for in terms of just,ep064
720,some alone time in the outdoors,ep064
723,back inside they see the dining area I,ep064
726,think that our soon-to-be dining table,ep064
729,could be right here I'll sleep fit one,ep064
732,right yeah they passed through to see,ep064
735,the kitchen she's a little small at,ep064
738,least that's upgraded though can open up,ep064
741,the you're also looking out over this,ep064
744,open space right the kitchen is the same,ep064
747,size as the one we have now the,ep064
750,difference is we can open up the oven,ep064
753,and the refrigerator at the same time,ep064
756,which is not asking much but it's,ep064
759,definitely an upgrade for us,ep064
762,my coffee maker and then open the window,ep064
765,I'm sitting out exactly I love the,ep064
768,granite countertops and I love the color,ep064
771,I think it just all it kind of comes,ep064
774,together another big plus is the modern,ep064
777,finishes within the unit that was on my,ep064
780,wish list I'm really happy to see that,ep064
783,when I walk in so I'm seeing a lot of,ep064
786,storage in here and I am hoping I am,ep064
789,going to see a washer and dryer not in,ep064
792,that one so let me explain there is a,ep064
795,laundry room in the building but not in,ep064
798,the units okay you could do a pick up,ep064
801,and deliver we compromise somewhere I,ep064
804,really think you're gonna like the,ep064
807,master tall ceilings moldings are,ep064
810,beautiful okay a little bigger than our,ep064
813,place now oh yeah,ep064
816,they check out the second bedroom oh,ep064
819,this would be a good baby room in the,ep064
822,bathroom okay a little tight in here yes,ep064
825,this is really I think it's smaller,ep064
828,that's yes let's pretend that the,ep064
831,mirrors over there actually I'm doing my,ep064
834,makeup yeah no this is just maybe if you,ep064
837,just pushed this wall out I know there's,ep064
840,some storage on the other side and maybe,ep064
843,could just knock it out it's an option,ep064
846,absolutely not if we're gonna move,ep064
849,forward with this this is our bathroom,ep064
852,the condo also has a rooftop deck Wow,ep064
855,look at the view yes it is nice over,ep064
858,here this is 12 miles to New York City,ep064
861,this is not something you can get if you,ep064
864,were living in a little house someplace,ep064
867,I guess I could see myself out here in,ep064
870,the mornings definitely yoga up here,ep064
873,[Music],ep064
876,so what do you guys think about this,ep064
879,unit we love the price,ep064
882,you love 3:30 we love the natural light,ep064
885,and we also love the layout yeah and the,ep064
888,location and the location it's walkable,ep064
891,the shops are right at our fingertips,ep064
894,but there is no washer and dryer there's,ep064
897,no watch'n Drive the bathroom's really,ep064
900,tight this is a hard sell for us,ep064
903,so their agent Roberta has lined up a,ep064
906,bigger place but it's more Sabrina style,ep064
909,than jamel's I love the cape cod-style,ep064
912,yeah I mean not my preferred but we'll,ep064
915,see,ep064
918,[Music],ep064
921,expectant parents Sabrina and Jamil are,ep064
924,looking to put down roots and Montclair,ep064
927,"New Jersey with a budget of $400,000",ep064
930,they've seen a 100 year old home that's,ep064
933,Sabrina light but it needed some work,ep064
936,then they saw a condo that Jamila,ep064
939,preferred but they both felt that it,ep064
942,might be a little small for their,ep064
945,growing family today they're a mile,ep064
948,outside their target area in Bloomfield,ep064
951,to see another single-family home this,ep064
954,is a three-bedroom one-bath Cape Cod,ep064
957,priced at 349 that's a really good price,ep064
960,it is and I love the Cape cod-style yeah,ep064
963,I mean not my preferred choice but the,ep064
966,price is good so I could be I could be,ep064
969,convinced I think that Jamila and,ep064
972,Sabrina would really enjoy this house,ep064
975,once her baby came because there's a,ep064
978,little more space it has some options,ep064
981,for growth oh this is nice Wow little,ep064
984,fireplace is level this is really nice,ep064
987,okay I guess it does have a little charm,ep064
990,yeah there is a sunroom right here too,ep064
993,which is very very bright okay and then,ep064
996,we can even use it in the wintertime as,ep064
999,well especially with a little run,ep064
1002,running running around yeah yeah we can,ep064
1005,definitely fit like a nice table in here,ep064
1008,and the best thing is that it opens up,ep064
1011,to the kitchen area so it gives us a lot,ep064
1014,of space to not be so closed off from,ep064
1017,our guests if they're here yeah I really,ep064
1020,like the way it flows yeah and I like,ep064
1023,that the kitchen is updated ready yeah,ep064
1026,one two three,ep064
1029,off the kitchen is a deck so not only do,ep064
1032,you have a yard you have a deck yeah we,ep064
1035,can add an addition may put some stairs,ep064
1038,down here and just open up to the rest,ep064
1041,of the yard space it's a really big,ep064
1044,space I would normally fight that but,ep064
1047,you know the price points really good so,ep064
1050,we may be able to have some wiggle room,ep064
1053,wait so are you saying you're actually,ep064
1056,open to some renovations the right,ep064
1059,situation may be I think this house,ep064
1062,doesn't need much convincing for Jamila,ep064
1065,I think he can see himself in this home,ep064
1068,a little bit,ep064
1071,[Music],ep064
1074,yeah we can both fit in here I like the,ep064
1077,finishes they really took a job with Deb,ep064
1080,Nate's in here they see a bedroom,ep064
1083,downstairs and head to the second floor,ep064
1086,with us to consider the master bedroom,ep064
1089,you can make it into the master we can,ep064
1092,even have us a little nook right there,ep064
1095,there's some in there say it's great,ep064
1098,space,ep064
1101,okay and then there's a little law I can,ep064
1104,hide in here across the hall is a,ep064
1107,possible nursery Wow yeah it's actually,ep064
1110,really perfect for a nursery Oliver yeah,ep064
1113,yeah I love this house it has that,ep064
1116,little Cape Cod feel to it put a few,ep064
1119,pillows over there is perfect they check,ep064
1122,out the unfinished basement a lot of,ep064
1125,space down here for sure it just needs,ep064
1128,some work,ep064
1131,sure yeah is that a toilet over there,ep064
1134,yes you could make a full bathroom here,ep064
1137,if you wished there is a laundry hook up,ep064
1140,down here as well okay okay so there's a,ep064
1143,hook up at least so is this a,ep064
1146,consideration yeah definitely I think,ep064
1149,this is definitely in a running it's not,ep064
1152,really a fixer-upper I really like the,ep064
1155,open kitchen concept the move-in,ep064
1158,readiness of this place is a huge plus,ep064
1161,for me I'm not really happy about the,ep064
1164,the yard where I put the new baby coming,ep064
1167,along that's not something that I would,ep064
1170,really want to take off it has three,ep064
1173,bedrooms not too fond of the curb appeal,ep064
1176,it's just wasn't my style but at this,ep064
1179,price point is a really attractive only,ep064
1182,a mile away from the Montclair area I,ep064
1185,mean I guess that's not too bad,ep064
1188,since none of the options meet all their,ep064
1191,needs they'll have to decide between,ep064
1194,price walkability and in-unit laundry so,ep064
1197,what are we designing,ep064
1200,soon-to-be parents Sabrina and Jamil are,ep064
1203,looking to find the perfect first home,ep064
1206,"for their baby with a budget of $400,000",ep064
1209,they've seen several single-family homes,ep064
1212,and condos in and around Montclair New,ep064
1215,Jersey now it's time to decide so the,ep064
1218,first one that we need to talk about is,ep064
1221,the vintage home for 399 I love the fact,ep064
1224,that it's a standalone home but if the,ep064
1227,bedrooms are really really tiny yeah and,ep064
1230,I could barely walk down the basement,ep064
1233,without hitting my head and I'm not even,ep064
1236,that tall but it did have the full-sized,ep064
1239,washer and dryer at the top of our,ep064
1242,budget at 399 and we have the remedy,ep064
1245,okay let's take a look at the next house,ep064
1248,the condo for 3:30 the price point was,ep064
1251,nice I really like the flow of the condo,ep064
1254,it's finished,ep064
1257,there was no maintenance I think you're,ep064
1260,really trying to sell me on this home,ep064
1263,because you know it's a condo I have to,ep064
1266,admit the location is perfect it's,ep064
1269,literally downtown and the big plus was,ep064
1272,that there was a terrorist no washer and,ep064
1275,dryer I don't like communal laundry,ep064
1278,spaces but I do all the laundry let's,ep064
1281,look at the Cape Cod for 349 another,ep064
1284,standalone house Joey,ep064
1287,surprisingly I actually liked this place,ep064
1290,he didn't like the yard and the deck but,ep064
1293,I actually like the inside of that place,ep064
1296,it was practically done it had three,ep064
1299,bedrooms and there was the washer and,ep064
1302,dryer hookup but it's really not in our,ep064
1305,desired location yeah it definitely,ep064
1308,would have to drive to downtown to the,ep064
1311,restaurants and the shops so that's,ep064
1314,something to think about,ep064
1317,so what are we deciding,ep064
1320,[Music],ep064
1323,the more than I think about it I have to,ep064
1326,agree with you a little bit on the condo,ep064
1329,there is really no renovations to be,ep064
1332,done it's not a fixer-upper I think we,ep064
1335,can work with it that would give us an,ep064
1338,opportunity to just focus on the baby so,ep064
1341,I think we should go with the condo I,ep064
1344,agree we should definitely talk to,ep064
1347,Roberta before you change your mind yeah,ep064
1350,[Music],ep064
1353,absolutely so we chose the condo the,ep064
1356,house was listed at 3:30 we actually,ep064
1359,paid 335 for it because there were,ep064
1362,multiple offers right but they still got,ep064
1365,"it for way under their original $400,000",ep064
1368,budget another reason why we chose this,ep064
1371,place because it was important for us to,ep064
1374,be somewhere that's active now one block,ep064
1377,away from the downtown area we could,ep064
1380,literally grab a stroller and head,ep064
1383,downtown this is what exactly what I was,ep064
1386,asking for I think we made the best,ep064
1389,financial decision in terms of,ep064
1392,maintaining our lifestyle I'm really,ep064
1395,excited for the for our baby to come I'm,ep064
1398,excited for more adventures more travel,ep064
1401,I keep traveling that's the pain what's,ep064
1404,the baby in you with the baby coming we,ep064
1407,really wanted to just be able to focus,ep064
1410,on our child rather than the maintenance,ep064
1413,of the house all right,ep064
1416,last year's chair finally got your,ep064
1419,dining room table yes bingo but they do,ep064
1422,have one project in mind we're we,ep064
1425,thinking about cutting one of the,ep064
1428,closets in half and then maybe opening,ep064
1431,up the bathroom a little bit more you,ep064
1434,know I did get the condo so I do have to,ep064
1437,be open to renovations yeah how are you,ep064
1440,enjoying your carts yeah I don't know,ep064
1443,you really appreciate the thing look,ep064
1446,they could go full twirl oh nice so 360,ep064
1449,button you know I'm still the laundry,ep064
1452,guy that was our compromise and we have,ep064
1455,been sticking to it,ep064
1458,they're also in full prep mode we see,ep064
1461,ourselves here five to seven years she,ep064
1464,obviously has a we did a calculation I,ep064
1467,think five seven years and what we need,ep064
1470,to start looking or if for some reason,ep064
1473,we have like I said of twins after this,ep064
1476,and we just yeah way to put that in the,ep064
1479,universe yeah good job ready yeah let's,ep064
1482,go,ep064
12,look at this Wow bedroom that's awesome,ep065
15,first-time homebuyers Tom and Megan are,ep065
18,looking to buy in Temecula California I,ep065
21,already have ideas for this house but,ep065
24,while she wants to tackle project,ep065
27,I think paint and then you could even,ep065
30,just put regular brick right in the,ep065
33,middle and it'd be really pretty feature,ep065
36,wall he wants turnkey and he has some,ep065
39,pretty strong opinions about anything,ep065
42,that doesn't fit the bill,ep065
45,dated kind of gross nasty they're ugly,ep065
48,more nasty gross carpet can Megan,ep065
51,convince him that what's old can be made,ep065
54,new again this is really easy I could,ep065
57,probably pick this out right now let's,ep065
60,crush,ep065

81,that's about a hundred degrees out right,ep065
84,now,ep065
87,I am from Rhode Island I'm from New,ep065
90,Hampshire we both ran away from New,ep065
93,England to find each other here in,ep065
96,Southern California which we absolutely,ep065
99,love we met at work I asked her to join,ep065
102,me for a baseball game,ep065
105,shada bar she surrounded the office to,ep065
108,make sure I wasn't you know a total,ep065
111,creeper and evidently got a thumbs up he,ep065
114,did they got the approval so I thought,ep065
117,why not I don't know if there's love at,ep065
120,first sight but I was in love,ep065
123,they've been married for nearly two,ep065
126,years and have one daughter and a son on,ep065
129,the way we have a daughter Penelope,ep065
132,grace she is 17 months old and she's,ep065
135,gonna be about a year and a half when,ep065
138,her brother Jackson arrives they live in,ep065
141,Temecula a bedroom community 60 miles,ep065
144,north of San Diego it's really really,ep065
147,nice up here it's a beautiful area there,ep065
150,are parks everywhere there are family,ep065
153,centric activities it's really Pleasant,ep065
156,oh hey but with a baby on the way they'd,ep065
159,like to get out of their rental,ep065
162,apartment and into a larger home let's,ep065
165,get that one sign me up show me where,ep065
168,"that is for $400,000 in this air with a",ep065
171,"budget of $400,000 they want a 3-bedroom",ep065
174,home with a yard for the kids in a quiet,ep065
177,neighborhood cold a sack preferably I,ep065
180,want our kiddos to be able to go out and,ep065
183,play and be safe also we're really eager,ep065
186,to find high ceilings big kitchen lots,ep065
189,of storage that's pretty much where,ep065
192,their consensus ends this is what I was,ep065
195,talking about the open floor plan it's a,ep065
198,little too open for me my like division,ep065
201,you know between kitchen and dining room,ep065
204,and living room as opposed to just one,ep065
207,big open room,ep065
210,and I like the idea of division being,ep065
213,created by furniture with the open floor,ep065
216,plan you're able to see everything and I,ep065
219,like clean and minimal furnishings so an,ep065
222,open layout allows me to design in that,ep065
225,and not your way I do not like that at,ep065
228,all I'm surprised to hear that because,ep065
231,that looks like a classic turnkey house,ep065
234,I want new I want ready to go I want,ep065
237,clean I do not want a turnkey house that,ep065
240,is like paying full retail for someone,ep065
243,else's vision and Meghan's eager to get,ep065
246,her hands on a house in need of what she,ep065
249,calls cosmetic lipstick cosmetic,ep065
252,lipstick to me property is anything from,ep065
255,putting paint on the walls to changing,ep065
258,faucets to adding crown molding maybe,ep065
261,having new flooring really just changing,ep065
264,the whole vibe of the house now do you,ep065
267,guys want a pool I would like a pool in,ep065
270,the backyard yeah I don't I don't want,ep065
273,to have the maintenance I don't want to,ep065
276,worry about my kids don't want it,ep065
279,they'll defend someone do all that but,ep065
282,like a community pool that's gonna be a,ep065
285,necessity we have to have that they're,ep065
288,also pretty far apart on style I would,ep065
291,really like contemporary ranch one-story,ep065
294,house I want to story with little ones I,ep065
297,would really like one level I really,ep065
300,want a two-story the two stories is,ep065
303,something that's very has a great curb,ep065
306,appeal has a very homey feel when I,ep065
309,Drive up to it and in California,ep065
312,spanish-style is something that I am,ep065
315,attracted to because it's so cookie,ep065
318,cutter it's that ticky tacky like the,ep065
321,neighborhood suburbia it just it feels,ep065
324,like California to me it feels like what,ep065
327,I see in the movies,ep065
330,and I want to be a part of it it's like,ep065
333,oh look we live in the movies it's,ep065
336,ridiculous,ep065
339,but I love it nice quiet street I wish,ep065
342,that they all kind of looked more,ep065
345,similar oh look at this one story,ep065
348,it's all you're excited I think it's,ep065
351,beautiful it's the contemporary it's the,ep065
354,ranch-style one-story no stairs for the,ep065
357,kids it's exactly what I want this is,ep065
360,not the house I'm looking for,ep065
363,so one story is not spanish-style like,ep065
366,it in the vibes hi guys I like this tall,ep065
369,ceilings I do like the high ceilings but,ep065
372,when you walk in there's just walls I,ep065
375,feel like those walls have these kind of,ep065
378,weird geometric shapes going on it,ep065
381,but it's got the division of rooms you,ep065
384,are yeah I see a lot of things that you,ep065
387,like yeah there's an HOA $99 a month uh,ep065
390,it does include parks and a community,ep065
393,pool and it's priced at 399 nine top of,ep065
396,the budget but it looks to me like it's,ep065
399,moving ready and looks nice I mean I,ep065
402,like the floors I don't really like the,ep065
405,different types of floors I don't know,ep065
408,our formal dining room it's nice it's,ep065
411,all one room but it's tight but I,ep065
414,seating eight right there so I mean,ep065
417,that's pretty good that's nice here's,ep065
420,our kitchen it's good space I could make,ep065
423,this kitchen so pretty well it's the top,ep065
426,of our budget I know I personally like,ep065
429,it,ep065
432,the kitchen is just ready to be redone,ep065
435,there's so many things that I'm thinking,ep065
438,off the top of my head right now that I,ep065
441,would just want to get my hands on and,ep065
444,change immediately this is challenging,ep065
447,for me use tiles have these like little,ep065
450,grout lines the color of these cabinets,ep065
453,drives me bananas and the appliances are,ep065
456,all different and we have a black fake,ep065
459,to struggle for me I have to be honest,ep065
462,is Connor hey I just think for our,ep065
465,family's eyes it's just about perfect,ep065
468,time this would be something to be very,ep065
471,difficult for me to just stare at and,ep065
474,not be able to change this house is,ep065
477,clean it's functional is ready to move,ep065
480,in,ep065
483,I really think this house could work for,ep065
486,us let me show you the backyard,ep065
489,oh this is great oh wow cutting green oh,ep065
492,yeah I'm ready to grill already this is,ep065
495,really really cool,ep065
498,no pool I community there's a community,ep065
501,pool perfect there is some room for the,ep065
504,kids to play I like that there's an area,ep065
507,to kind of entertain and be outside I,ep065
510,love the back here that's great,ep065
513,back inside they check out two bedrooms,ep065
516,for the kids I know it doesn't have,ep065
519,closet doors I actually don't mind that,ep065
522,I'd like to have doors on there since,ep065
525,I'm a stay-at-home dad I'm the one,ep065
528,that's cleaning up so I like that I can,ep065
531,close the doors and the little ones,ep065
534,can't be pulling things out and,ep065
537,terrorizing their room they also see a,ep065
540,guest bathroom and the master suite look,ep065
543,at this this is great oh yeah luxurious,ep065
546,high ceilings we do have a sliding glass,ep065
549,door that leads you to the back yard,ep065
552,look at this oh my gosh it has its own,ep065
555,covering Wow bedroom that's awesome,ep065
558,beautiful it's a great size really yes,ep065
561,so here's the master bathroom Wow,ep065
564,everything in this area is big I like,ep065
567,the Roman tub so guys what do you think,ep065
570,I love it this is exactly my style you,ep065
573,know single storey house they're looking,ep065
576,for me upstairs,ep065
579,I definitely love like the grill space,ep065
582,and the fun and greens gotta go too yeah,ep065
585,I mean the walls everywhere kind of,ep065
588,in-your-face when you walk in I like,ep065
591,more of an open floor plan I was hoping,ep065
594,for community pools good that master,ep065
597,bedroom though I walked in and I felt,ep065
600,like this is something I deserve overall,ep065
603,I love this house no I wish there's more,ep065
606,projects I'm happy that there aren't as,ep065
609,many projects as she would like well,ep065
612,there's a lot to talk about there is but,ep065
615,in the meantime their agent shows them a,ep065
618,house that's more suited for Megan this,ep065
621,is so cute I love this neighborhood but,ep065
624,it comes with a huge trade-off,ep065
627,[Music],ep065
630,Tom and Megan are looking for their,ep065
633,first home in Temecula California and,ep065
636,would like to be settled and moved in,ep065
639,before their second child is born do you,ep065
642,know what's going on there,ep065
645,you're just petting me a little brother,ep065
648,"but with their $400,000 budgets they're",ep065
651,having a hard time agreeing on what's,ep065
654,best for their family so far they've,ep065
657,seen a single-story ranch at the top of,ep065
660,their budget the Tom liked now they're,ep065
663,seeing a two-story California Spanish,ep065
666,for Megan this is so cute,ep065
669,I love this neighborhood it is at the,ep065
672,end of a cul-de-sac ticky tacky,ep065
675,spanish-style this is exactly what I'm,ep065
678,looking for this really isn't my style,ep065
681,house I like the single-story ranch,ep065
684,it's what Megan wants but it's not what,ep065
687,I'd like this is so pretty nice come on,ep065
690,in I know I know,ep065
693,carpet and paint is just carpet and,ep065
696,paint I don't know with this color what,ep065
699,making calls cosmetic lipstick is,ep065
702,definitely what this property needs I do,ep065
705,like the high ceilings and there's good,ep065
708,light in here but it's nasty yeah but,ep065
711,it's a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath,ep065
714,it does have an HOA just $99 a month a,ep065
717,Choi does include a pool there's a,ep065
720,tennis court walking trails lotta,ep065
723,amenities and it's priced at 405 over,ep065
726,budgets and ugly oh and it's not though,ep065
729,the one-story ranch I want anyway it's,ep065
732,just scary I mean it's got big windows I,ep065
735,really like the light right coming in,ep065
738,why don't we see their office let's take,ep065
741,a tour so right here obviously this is,ep065
744,our formal living room nasty I hate,ep065
747,carpet this car specifically I can just,ep065
750,see myself I'll just rip it up right now,ep065
753,it smells it has stains it looks like,ep065
756,they maybe had animals here and I don't,ep065
759,like it you do have a fireplace like,ep065
762,that this is our dining room what do you,ep065
765,think that's all I agree and the span of,ep065
768,about 15 feet we have three different,ep065
771,types of flooring,ep065
774,this is the farthest thing from turnkey,ep065
777,I can think of so the kitchen is pretty,ep065
780,dark and tight Holy Smoke is small okay,ep065
783,so I already see things that I would,ep065
786,love to change is see over here is,ep065
789,little details in the corner that are,ep065
792,like rock they're not really my style I,ep065
795,do like that we got this nice window,ep065
798,looking out to the backyard and so,ep065
801,you'll be in here cooking and see the,ep065
804,kids that's nice yeah that's very nice,ep065
807,and these appliances black and stainless,ep065
810,and this seems like a different type of,ep065
813,stainless that is definitely something,ep065
816,that's a change,ep065
819,yeah they check out the family room and,ep065
822,the half bath before heading to the,ep065
825,backyard,ep065
828,what is that dad so to be at water,ep065
831,feature of some sort it's up half the,ep065
834,yard it's almost the size of a Jacuzzi,ep065
837,yes or or something did they give up,ep065
840,halfway or what happened here I just,ep065
843,really don't understand what's supposed,ep065
846,to be put on a helmet honours yeah am I,ep065
849,here in a busy street yes it does back,ep065
852,up to a busy street okay it is quiet in,ep065
855,the house still the lost size is what,ep065
858,I'm looking for but this really really,ep065
861,turns me off I know it could be fixed,ep065
864,what the cost of it it doesn't make,ep065
867,sense,ep065
870,back inside they go upstairs to see two,ep065
873,bedrooms a full bath and the master,ep065
876,bedroom big windows a lot of light,ep065
879,coming in and I feeling I see likes tall,ep065
882,ceilings and a lot of natural light look,ep065
885,at the corrosion on these faucets yeah,ep065
888,those are definitely have to be replaced,ep065
891,and I definitely don't like carpet in,ep065
894,the bathroom that would have to be,ep065
897,replaced,ep065
900,yeah we're getting the money for all,ep065
903,this no you do have a walk-in shower oh,ep065
906,and a big tub - that's nice and I like,ep065
909,that the the toilet stuff right here,ep065
912,yeah that's interesting yeah,ep065
915,[Music],ep065
918,I really like the high ceilings I see a,ep065
921,lot of potential in here I'll agree with,ep065
924,that yeah I also like all the projects I,ep065
927,see I think it'd be really fun I do not,ep065
930,like I don't think this is the house,ep065
933,that Tom would really want to be in but,ep065
936,I would love to put my own touch on this,ep065
939,house I see all the potential Megan does,ep065
942,like this house,ep065
945,she likes the project but it's over,ep065
948,budget and if it was over budget and,ep065
951,turnkey great but a house as a whole,ep065
954,really it scares me so their agents,ep065
957,lined up a house that he hopes will be a,ep065
960,happy medium this neighborhood is so,ep065
963,cute it is beautiful banished them,ep065
966,[Music],ep065
969,[Laughter],ep065
972,"Megan and Tom have $400,000 for their",ep065
975,first home in the suburban community of,ep065
978,Temecula 60 miles north of San Diego but,ep065
981,they can't agree on what they want so,ep065
984,far they've seen a single-story ranch,ep065
987,that Tom liked and a California style,ep065
990,Spanish for Megan but both were priced a,ep065
993,little high,ep065
996,[Music],ep065
999,today their agents lined up a,ep065
1002,less-expensive two-story traditional,ep065
1005,this neighborhood is so cute it is,ep065
1008,beautiful,ep065
1011,very clean Spanish and it's not my ranch,ep065
1014,either so yeah I really want that,ep065
1017,one-story house the style of the house,ep065
1020,it reminds me a little bit more of the,ep065
1023,East Coast than the Spanish style I'm,ep065
1026,really looking for it's a little bit,ep065
1029,different than what you guys want but,ep065
1032,it's priced only at 389 9 it is a good,ep065
1035,price it is a great price 17 64 square,ep065
1038,feet okay that's a good size,ep065
1041,low monthly HOA of only $45 a month Wow,ep065
1044,based on the current market right now,ep065
1047,there's not a whole lot of inventory,ep065
1050,that I can show Megan and Tom and 389 9,ep065
1053,is a bargain the purpose is really weird,ep065
1056,fireplace is gonna seem old dated kind,ep065
1059,of gross and these floors look I mean,ep065
1062,that could be something pretty easy fix,ep065
1065,I think paint and then you could even,ep065
1068,just put regular brick right in the,ep065
1071,middle and if the whole thing's white,ep065
1074,could be a really pretty feature wall I,ep065
1077,don't know let's keep in mind that I,ep065
1080,want new I don't want dated stuff it's,ep065
1083,gross what kind of nasty that is paint,ep065
1086,that's paint,ep065
1089,everything's just paint with you but for,ep065
1092,me it's a little more than that I,ep065
1095,already have ideas for this house I,ep065
1098,already have ideas that I would love to,ep065
1101,upgrade and I don't think they'd be too,ep065
1104,overwhelming and the price point in this,ep065
1107,house is lower than budget which is,ep065
1110,exciting ceilings are nice I like my,ep065
1113,feelings having the natural light is,ep065
1116,great this is our formal dining room,ep065
1119,small it's tight they see a half bath in,ep065
1122,the hallway,ep065
1125,Oh roses this is really easy I could,ep065
1128,probably take this down right now that's,ep065
1131,gross then head to the kitchen oh it's,ep065
1134,not white these countertops serve pretty,ep065
1137,tremendous they're ugly it's safe to say,ep065
1140,you'd have to do everything in here it's,ep065
1143,all dated this is the addition that they,ep065
1146,did hmm this I like a lot you know,ep065
1149,natural light really bright spacious is,ep065
1152,this included in the square footage it,ep065
1155,is included it is looking for minute as,ep065
1158,well okay it's beautiful,ep065
1161,let's go outside watch your step here,ep065
1164,it's nice little entertaining space,ep065
1167,right here and this yard is gorgeous I,ep065
1170,really really like this area this is,ep065
1173,super pretty you said there was an HOA,ep065
1176,but it was pretty low so was our pool,ep065
1179,there is no pool I've just brought the,ep065
1182,price way up back inside they head,ep065
1185,upstairs to see two bedrooms it is small,ep065
1188,it is pretty tiny and the master,ep065
1191,comparatively it's bigger it's bigger,ep065
1194,I mean being the master it should be but,ep065
1197,it's not a good master size I bet with,ep065
1200,furniture in here this feels really,ep065
1203,small this is the master suite with the,ep065
1206,double vanities and a stand-up shower,ep065
1209,dirty dated I don't know I definitely,ep065
1212,would need a tub I do like the double,ep065
1215,vanity,ep065
1218,but like you said it's dated I want new,ep065
1221,oh it's gonna be all brand new when,ep065
1224,we're done with that well I really like,ep065
1227,how light and bright it is I like the,ep065
1230,high ceiling that's nice the,ep065
1233,cookie-cutter neighborhood I really like,ep065
1236,I see a lot of projects that I could,ep065
1239,definitely do already thinking about it,ep065
1242,the only thing is that the rooms are,ep065
1245,kind of small but the yard size is,ep065
1248,fantastic it'd be better with a pool for,ep065
1251,a community with a pool okay but I like,ep065
1254,the outdoor area for the kids I don't,ep065
1257,like are the projects it's a big,ep065
1260,decision for our family so I think we're,ep065
1263,gonna have to give you a call okay they,ep065
1266,have a tough choice to make and it may,ep065
1269,come down to move-in-ready versus,ep065

1302,single-level ranch that's my favorite,ep065
1305,that's exactly what I want I want the,ep065
1308,ones story it's turnkey I love that,ep065
1311,backyard that really cool outdoor area,ep065
1314,with the grill and the bar yeah putting,ep065
1317,green here's the thing there wasn't a,ep065
1320,ton of projects so that's a con for me,ep065
1323,huge pro for me and then the,ep065
1326,spanish-style one over budget that was,ep065
1329,coming in at four hundred and five,ep065
1332,thousand yeah that is no good which is a,ep065
1335,bummer cuz it was all its ticky tacky I,ep065
1338,mean that was the neighborhood I was,ep065
1341,looking at it's on a cul-de-sac needs a,ep065
1344,lot of work and projects but if we're,ep065
1347,already over budget where's the money,ep065
1350,can I come from okay the two-story,ep065
1353,traditional the one that was under,ep065
1356,budget was like three eighty nine nine,ep065
1359,what did you like about that one I mean,ep065
1362,I had a big enough yard for pool yeah it,ep065
1365,was good size it's under budget that was,ep065
1368,"a pretty big house like 1,800 square",ep065
1371,feet you ready to look at our list so,ep065
1374,the two-story Spanish I agree there are,ep065
1377,a ton of projects we could really make,ep065
1380,it ours if I could maybe talk to rameen,ep065
1383,and we can get that price down would,ep065
1386,that be something you'd be open to if we,ep065
1389,could get the price down and have some,ep065
1392,money to do the projects I can work with,ep065
1395,that yeah and then it would be our house,ep065
1398,I know that you love it see if we can,ep065
1401,get the price down okay great let's talk,ep065
1404,to her mean right now okay,ep065
1407,now what,ep065
1410,so we're new homeowners love that we,ep065
1413,ended up going with the two-story,ep065
1416,Spanish that Megan really wanted it was,ep065
1419,for sale for four hundred five thousand,ep065
1422,dollars we offered three ninety five and,ep065
1425,the appraisal came back a little lower,ep065
1428,so we got it for three ninety one and,ep065
1431,that's a great deal we had a little bit,ep065
1434,of money to spend in order for her to do,ep065
1437,the project that she really wants to do,ep065
1440,we received the keys about three weeks,ep065
1443,ago and that evening I started taking,ep065
1446,things down oh okay one of my biggest,ep065
1449,concerns that I had was that pit of a,ep065
1452,hazard that's in the backyard we're,ep065
1455,already moving forward with getting it,ep065
1458,fixed which is great and it's actually,ep065
1461,coming in less than what we expected to,ep065
1464,pay that was a huge surprise it's not,ep065
1467,the turnkey that I wanted it's not the,ep065
1470,single-story ranch but I am seeing,ep065
1473,Megan's vision more and more and I'm,ep065
1476,just really excited for the end product,ep065
1479,and to get in here and start enjoying,ep065
1482,our lives and just really really,ep065

84,currently a student about to graduate,ep066
87,with my MBA I'm excited for graduation,ep066
90,we've been married for almost ten years,ep066
93,we both grew up on Long Island New York,ep066
96,we met each other as teenagers we just,ep066
99,clicked,ep066
102,I knew Ali was the one right away due to,ep066
105,her kindness and sense of humor mark,ep066
108,really balances me I am a type-a person,ep066
111,and I would be go-go-go,ep066

117,out and says hey stop breathe meditate,ep066
120,we moved down to Florida together for,ep066

135,graduations coming up around the corner,ep066
138,it's been great two years and we,ep066
141,actually have fallen in love with,ep066
144,Chicago lot of things to do a lot of,ep066
147,comedy shows museums plays all these,ep066
150,different things the city's 22 miles of,ep066
153,Lake Michigan shoreline are also a big,ep066
156,plus feels like we are surrounded by,ep066
159,some sort of ocean even though it's a,ep066
162,lake figure we love Chicago let's buy a,ep066
165,place helping them with their search is,ep066
168,their real estate broker JP Martin's I,ep066
171,want to know where you guys are looking,ep066
174,for what you really want in your homes,ep066
177,I really like the bro house style that,ep066
180,vintage charmed you know when they have,ep066
183,built-in shelves or it really thick,ep066
186,baseboards chair rails all of those,ep066
189,details that really make it feel like,ep066
192,home what about you mark well I'm,ep066
195,looking for a view he's hoping to find a,ep066
198,unit with a view similar to the one in,ep066
201,their current rental a high-rise,ep066
204,something to look at the lake and inside,ep066
207,he favors a modern loft look I enjoy,ep066
210,exposed brickwork ducks extremely high,ep066
213,ceilings since their current apartment,ep066
216,is in the suburb of Evanston,ep066
219,near where Ali's going to school she,ep066
222,wants the place they buy to be in the,ep066
225,heart of the city to be able to walk to,ep066
228,everything in the city will be I think a,ep066
231,lot nicer at a minimum two bedrooms are,ep066
234,necessary because we need a home office,ep066
237,but ideally a third bedroom for my cat,ep066
240,Mikey Shh,ep066
243,Mikey is now 19 years old she says feet,ep066
246,she just is extremely loud Shh would,ep066
249,really be beneficial to maybe shut the,ep066
252,door at night,ep066
255,and mark is looking for a specific,ep066
258,feature in the master bathroom a window,ep066
261,in a bathroom I think is a way for me to,ep066
264,feel like a home all the buildings we've,ep066
267,lived in in the past there's never been,ep066
270,a window,ep066
273,he said he feel like we made it in a,ep066
276,dream kitchen for me I want a really big,ep066
279,open area for entertaining a huge island,ep066
282,would be great granite countertop the,ep066
285,most cabinet space possible a space for,ep066
288,trash to go under the sink because I am,ep066
291,really sensitive to smell they also want,ep066
294,stainless steel appliances a gas range,ep066
297,and a spot for a bar I have all of this,ep066
300,bar where from my grandma and there are,ep066
303,also the holidays to consider my,ep066
306,birthday is on Christmas I love the,ep066
309,holiday and I love to decorate for it I,ep066
312,really want a big beautiful picture,ep066
315,window where you can put a Christmas,ep066
318,tree and ideally there would be room for,ep066
321,multiple trees not just one she'd also,ep066
324,like a fireplace where she can hang,ep066
327,stockings this is the fun part now how,ep066
330,much are we thinking what is your budget,ep066
333,"we are thinking 500,000 an ally plans to",ep066
336,put her business savvy to work by taking,ep066
339,detailed notes on the houses they see I,ep066
342,will get making this spreadsheet on all,ep066
345,the properties we're looking at a,ep066
348,spreadsheet can help us be organized,ep066
351,about things and figure out how to make,ep066
354,sure we're getting the best value first,ep066
357,up there broker has lined up a condo in,ep066
360,the neighborhood of Edgewater about 20,ep066
363,minutes north of downtown Chicago I,ep066
366,brought you guys here to Edgewater today,ep066
369,because it's between Everson in the city,ep066
372,mark once a high-rise or the view and,ep066
375,with five hundred thousand a budget it's,ep066
378,almost impossible to get that a little,ep066
381,closer to downtown Chicago well you guys,ep066
384,think I think it looks beautiful on the,ep066
387,outside really has that vintage charm,ep066
390,the bay windows the brick,ep066
393,it's a high-rise so there might be some,ep066
396,good news the views from inside is,ep066
399,incredible,ep066
402,come on in guys okay oh that's a nice,ep066
405,entryway big foyer look how amazing this,ep066
408,is,ep066
411,so much room yeah I love the crown,ep066
414,molding the hardwood floors,ep066
417,"so this place is 1,900 square feet well",ep066
420,that's three bedrooms two bathrooms how,ep066
423,much is it though four filty what that's,ep066
426,low isn't it awesome under budget like,ep066
429,that and a lot of square footage that's,ep066
432,great absolutely fireplace that looks,ep066
435,cool,ep066
438,it's a wood-burning fireplace as well,ep066
441,nice so you could put stockings up there,ep066
444,hear that crackling sound that's,ep066
447,absolutely true,ep066
450,yeah and Mike look at that oh yeah nice,ep066
453,of you yeah you put a Christmas tree,ep066
456,right there,ep066
459,hahaha my grandma gave me a lot of,ep066
462,barware I inherited a lot of that and so,ep066
465,I could probably set that up right there,ep066
468,in the corner that's awesome that's,ep066
471,actually great space for it yeah so you,ep066
474,have a proper dining room beautiful it's,ep066
477,not open to the kitchen but I love that,ep066
480,glass through it so it feels like it's,ep066
483,open it really does and then there's,ep066
486,another bay window where I could put,ep066
489,another Christmas tree whenever I walk,ep066
492,into a property I'm instantly looking,ep066
495,for where can I put the Christmas tree,ep066
498,or trees and there are definitely a lot,ep066
501,of options in this place this is a great,ep066
504,little breakfast nook oh look at these,ep066
507,nice stainless steel appliances although,ep066
510,counter and cabinet space look a little,ep066
513,tight the two-tone cabinets are a little,ep066
516,odd I think it looks modern I like it I,ep066
519,have something for you oh yeah even,ep066
522,trash cans great so guys this is the,ep066
525,smallest of the three bedrooms and I,ep066
528,think I'll be perfect for the cat yeah,ep066
531,that's true we could stick my key in,ep066
534,here she'd probably like the natural,ep066
537,light coming in that's nice the closet,ep066
540,into a bathroom oh my gosh but there's a,ep066
543,shower,ep066
546,I said full bath that's nice at least,ep066
549,there is a window that's pretty cool,ep066
552,there's a window in that bathroom,ep066
555,second does okay free spaces you guys,ep066
558,can actually use an office oh yeah great,ep066
561,office then here is the master bathroom,ep066
564,well it's bigger than the last one at,ep066
567,least but it's still really tiny piece,ep066
570,window although I don't know if you can,ep066
573,put the blinds up because there's a,ep066
576,building right there,ep066
579,alright guys so here you are on the,ep066
582,master oh yeah it's not great lots of,ep066
585,room it's very big yeah I made a,ep066
588,spreadsheet it's color coded red yellow,ep066
591,green for good fat so so so we have,ep066
594,"450,000 on the price that's great green",ep066
597,"green 1,900 square feet that's a",ep066
600,excellent price per square foot two,ep066
603,bathrooms at least one with a window got,ep066
606,it Green no way those are so small,ep066
609,that's got to be a yellow but chat area,ep066
612,that's a green view definitely agreeing,ep066
615,a great I really like the vintage charm,ep066
618,of this place I want to see something,ep066
621,more modern,ep066
624,so their broker has lined up a place,ep066
627,with a modern interior for mark but for,ep066
630,5:20 it can be yours still over budget,ep066
633,[Music],ep066
636,I'm really excited about this house hunt,ep066
639,me too she's excited for her new home,ep066
642,ally and Mark are ready to buy a home in,ep066
645,Chicago for themselves and their cat,ep066
648,"Mikey within a $500,000 budget so far",ep066
651,their broker has shown them a high-rise,ep066
654,with a view for mark that was vintage,ep066
657,inside for Ally but the kitchen was,ep066
660,short on storage and Mark wants a more,ep066
663,modern interior so now their broker has,ep066
666,lined up a renovated walk-up in Lincoln,ep066
669,Park it's one of the most desirable,ep066
672,neighborhoods in Chicago this she is he,ep066
675,is mostly of single-family homes,ep066
678,I found this condo good in 1926 okay how,ep066
681,"big did you say it's 1,400 square feet",ep066
684,two bedrooms two bathrooms oh yeah mark,ep066
687,and I agreed that we wanted that third,ep066
690,bedroom for Mikey four five twenty it,ep066
693,can be yours still over budget at them I,ep066
696,like all the stonework I love the street,ep066
699,it's not really contemporary building,ep066
702,but I like the brick a lot you know,ep066
705,gonna get any leak views but it's a,ep066
708,15-minute walk from it okay,ep066
711,this units a great compromise for them,ep066
714,because even though it has the vintage,ep066
717,look that she was looking for inside its,ep066
720,remodeled and it doesn't feel like,ep066
723,vintage it's nice it's kind of a room I,ep066
726,like the crown molding adds a lot of,ep066
729,nice character to it that's a perfect,ep066
732,Christmas tree window right there,ep066
735,dele don't knock in the corner I'd say,ep066
738,would be perfect set up a bar yeah,ep066
741,that's true,ep066
744,it's not exactly a great view I know,ep066
747,Ally doesn't mind looking at some trees,ep066
750,for our view but I like to look at water,ep066
753,this isn't gonna do it bringing you guys,ep066
756,here to the kitchen we have a lot of,ep066
759,storage yeah these appliances look below,ep066
762,a little old old faded with the white,ep066
765,gas I think we'd want to replace these,ep066
768,this microwave oh no yeah but since it's,ep066
771,over budget,ep066
774,we really probably shouldn't I'd want to,ep066
777,put in a backsplash too where would we,ep066
780,put the trash so the fish can heat keep,ep066
783,those long ago wasn't it the sink,ep066
786,unfortunately is going on down there,ep066
789,however what they did was they put a,ep066
792,little cabinet right next to this thing,ep066
795,top so you can have a church can your,ep066
798,nose,ep066
801,and empty at every five minutes it's,ep066
804,tiny I was so excited about the hidden,ep066
807,trash cabinetry but I guess I was wrong,ep066
810,she hates it it's the smallest trashcan,ep066
813,she ever seen and she does not want to,ep066
816,deal with it,ep066
819,alright guys so let me walk through the,ep066
822,bedrooms okay,ep066
825,it's nice is a good size for a second,ep066
828,bedroom I think well this is the master,ep066
831,what I don't think I stuff in there yeah,ep066
834,yeah probably not we have a king-size,ep066
837,bed,ep066
840,you can totally fit a king-size right,ep066
843,here there's also an ensuite bathroom,ep066
846,windows you guys you have a few windows,ep066
849,in the bathroom and shower Wow,ep066
852,absolutely amazing you don't expect it,ep066
855,when you walk into that little bit you,ep066
858,already just live in here I guess with,ep066
861,not only two windows and the master,ep066
864,bathroom but with the beautiful finishes,ep066
867,stepping in the bathroom for the first,ep066
870,time was very exciting and this is the,ep066
873,bedroom not really much room for the cat,ep066
876,you want this to be your office I wish,ep066
879,there was a little bit more space of,ep066
882,Mikey cat area because she's probably,ep066
885,gonna end up in that tiny bedroom and it,ep066
888,might be just like our current living,ep066
891,situations outside they see a private,ep066
894,balcony it's nice you can definitely fit,ep066
897,barbecue tables chairs I like the brick,ep066
900,[Music],ep066
903,okay let's check this place out on the,ep066
906,spreadsheet it's over budget so we'll,ep066
909,make that read two bathrooms one with a,ep066
912,window yep so that's a green right there,ep066
915,Kat area but it really isn't that extra,ep066
918,space we were looking for view I like,ep066
921,those trees I think they look really,ep066
924,nice no good no view no yeah fine by,ep066
927,looking at the spreadsheet is clear Ali,ep066
930,likes the place more than me so to make,ep066
933,mark happy their broker has lined up a,ep066
936,loft but there's an L right next door,ep066
939,and this street seems like it has a lot,ep066
942,of traffic,ep066
945,[Music],ep066
948,we need to go to the store maybe a,ep066
951,farmers market farmers market Ali who's,ep066
954,finishing her MBA and her husband Mark,ep066
957,have fallen in love with Chicago and,ep066
960,"want to buy a home within their $500,000",ep066
963,budget in their adopted city so far,ep066
966,their broker has shown them an under,ep066
969,budget high-rise with a view just what,ep066
972,mark wants with original vintage details,ep066
975,for Ali but the kitchen was small and it,ep066
978,wasn't marked style inside they've also,ep066
981,seen a walk-up with an open floor plan,ep066
984,but it didn't have marks Lakeview and,ep066
987,there were only two bedrooms so now,ep066
990,their broker has lined up another option,ep066
993,this time in Wicker Park I found this,ep066
996,old converted factory that snow made,ep066
999,until loft I thought would be perfect,ep066
1002,for my do you like to look yeah there's,ep066
1005,nice details at the top so it's got that,ep066
1008,vintage look there's an L right next,ep066
1011,door and this street seems like it has a,ep066
1014,lot of traffic so it is a busy street,ep066
1017,the L is right there but the great thing,ep066
1020,is you guys can hop in and just go to,ep066
1023,the downtown in no time it's not a,ep066
1026,high-rise I don't know if there's gonna,ep066
1029,be any views surprisingly there is the,ep066
1032,good news is it's three bedrooms two,ep066
1035,bathrooms that does sound nice 3 bed 2,ep066
1038,"bath sounds nice 1,400 square feet for",ep066
1041,525 that's over budget the truth is if,ep066
1044,you want a three-bedroom moving ready,ep066
1047,updated it's gonna be tough to find it,ep066
1050,under our budget okay let's go,ep066
1053,all right guys coming in okay super open,ep066
1056,space in here this is definitely the law,ep066
1059,I've been thinking about not so crazy,ep066
1062,about the exposed ductwork I love it,ep066
1065,yeah and the break yeah this is cool you,ep066
1068,like that I figured you'd like it more,ep066
1071,than you would but also of you also have,ep066
1074,the view I think we both been spoiled by,ep066
1077,the view in our current place oh and,ep066
1080,there's the train but have you noticed,ep066
1083,how quiet it is in here it is quieter,ep066
1086,than I expected well the owner did,ep066
1089,premium work in the windows for showing,ep066
1092,the tree I guess would go in that window,ep066
1095,don't be nice right with the lights,ep066
1098,right we're kind of block the bar a,ep066
1101,little bit the fireplace which is really,ep066
1104,modern and sleek just doesn't seem like,ep066
1107,the best place for Christmas off the,ep066
1110,living room is a balcony,ep066
1113,I like the skyline they gonna be really,ep066
1116,cool at night yeah,ep066
1119,it's pretty tiny balcony I don't think,ep066
1122,it's tiny,ep066
1125,for Chicago living to be on this video,ep066
1128,yeah I think that's all we need,ep066
1131,Wow I do love the kitchen super modern,ep066
1134,everything's done ready to go gasps yeah,ep066
1137,I think it's a great kitchen for you,ep066
1140,guys I mean you have your island with,ep066
1143,granite counters you have actually two,ep066
1146,trash cans inside of the cabinet so one,ep066
1149,recycle great yes that is great okay,ep066
1152,so right behind you is the bedroom okay,ep066
1155,I think would be great for an office,ep066
1158,that is a little tiny it's kind of cool,ep066
1161,I guess there's windows well let me take,ep066
1164,you guys to the master okay pretty,ep066
1167,spacious anything yeah it is spacious oh,ep066
1170,oh that's nice but JP there's no window,ep066
1173,well keep the door open you can cancel,ep066
1176,it all they see the second full bath,ep066
1179,[Music],ep066
1182,with no windows the cat can live here it,ep066
1185,could have be her own bedroom okay let's,ep066
1188,figure out the spreadsheet let's do it,ep066
1191,all right so over budgets two bathrooms,ep066
1194,at least one with a window no one knows,ep066
1197,bread view it's not our old view it's,ep066
1200,City you know it's not my style but,ep066
1203,there are a lot of greens on the,ep066
1206,spreadsheet so I'll try to keep an open,ep066
1209,mind,ep066
1212,they've seen several condos that could,ep066
1215,work for them but in the end their,ep066
1218,decision may come down to number of,ep066
1221,bedrooms and view I'm gonna buy a house,ep066
1224,I've got my spreadsheet ready we can get,ep066
1227,this one for my mom for her Christmas,ep066
1230,tree she likes Cardinals yeah mark and,ep066
1233,Ally are in the market to buy their,ep066
1236,first condo in Chicago with their budget,ep066
1239,"of $500,000 got my spreadsheet so and",ep066
1242,I'm excited for all of them because,ep066
1245,after ten years it will be our first,ep066
1248,place together that's so exciting,ep066
1251,it's true so we've got the vintage,ep066
1254,"high-rise for 450,000 love the vintage",ep066
1257,charm love it under budget there are,ep066
1260,nice Christmas tree windows that kitchen,ep066
1263,would not work for me there were not,ep066
1266,enough cabinets no outdoor space but the,ep066
1269,view is the best by far I can see the,ep066
1272,lake what about the vintage walk up or,ep066
1275,you guys think that one is over budget,ep066
1278,five hundred twenty thousand and it's,ep066
1281,only two bedrooms so there's no real,ep066
1284,space for Mikey to go seems like a lot,ep066
1287,of projects there I think that has the,ep066
1290,most to do it's not turnkey but it's got,ep066
1293,great Christmas tree windows it has a,ep066
1296,vintage charm on the outside especially,ep066
1299,and inside I think it looks really,ep066
1302,pretty,ep066
1305,there's no views it's not much to look,ep066
1308,at let's go to the modern Wow how about,ep066
1311,that okay well that was five hundred,ep066
1314,twenty-five thousand so over budget and,ep066
1317,I didn't love this style I like the,ep066
1320,style a lot the brick is probably my,ep066
1323,favorite there's no windows in the,ep066
1326,bathroom but she likes the kitchen,ep066
1329,though,ep066
1332,the kitchen is nice it's great for,ep066
1335,entertaining it's open to the living,ep066
1338,room there were a lot of cabinets there,ep066
1341,was hidden trash that was a really nice,ep066
1344,kitchen and I think that third bedroom,ep066
1347,would be perfect for the cat all right,ep066
1350,so we have five rings on a vintage,ep066
1353,high-rise two greens on the vintage,ep066
1356,welcome and six greens and the modern,ep066
1359,loft so I need to know so I can put an,ep066
1362,offer in,ep066
1365,[Music],ep066
1368,my spreadsheet yeah might not be working,ep066
1371,that modern loft even though it has the,ep066
1374,most greetin's I just don't see us there,ep066
1377,it doesn't feel cozy it doesn't feel,ep066
1380,like home yeah that train noise this is,ep066
1383,a tough one for me style of the walk-up,ep066
1386,is sort of in the middle it has the open,ep066
1389,floor plan but would that bathroom alone,ep066
1392,I think I'm ready to put in an offer,ep066
1395,well I think that's the one - I agree,ep066
1398,let's do it,ep066
1401,vintage walk-up let's do it maybe if we,ep066
1404,put two sconces on the other sides of it,ep066
1407,look at the face we just moved in six,ep066
1410,days ago so we're still getting settled,ep066
1413,"JP made an offer at 500,000",ep066
1416,and he even suggested that we write a,ep066
1419,cover letter with it yeah and I guess it,ep066
1422,worked yeah it did and here we are in,ep066
1425,our new home and we love it I was able,ep066
1428,to convince mark to take on a couple of,ep066
1431,projects before we moved in because I,ep066
1434,thought it would be easier when there,ep066
1437,was no furniture in the place so we've,ep066
1440,been able to install floors in the,ep066
1443,bedrooms and the backsplash in the,ep066
1446,kitchen it makes a big difference I like,ep066
1449,it,ep066
1452,the trash can is really tiny but I was,ep066
1455,able to turn an old chest that my father,ep066
1458,gave to me into our recycling bin it,ep066
1461,holds a lot it's very nice I like it it,ep066
1464,doesn't look like a trash bin yeah,ep066
1467,that's great,ep066
1470,oh man that TV is massive see we've been,ep066
1473,having fun ordering new furniture for,ep066
1476,our first home but my first big purchase,ep066
1479,was an 82 inch TV my sister and her,ep066
1482,family are here to see the new home and,ep066
1485,it's a great thing because we needed an,ep066
1488,extra set of hands to get that TV on the,ep066
1491,wall yeah it was a big help,ep066
1494,yeah and a big TV,ep066
1497,I think Mikey's still finding her place,ep066
1500,in the new home we didn't get a third,ep066
1503,bedroom so she's sharing it with us but,ep066
1506,she does love to curl up in the second,ep066
1509,bedroom and take nap this is the perfect,ep066
1512,compromise for us he got two windows in,ep066
1515,the master bathroom and I was able to,ep066
1518,get that vintage cozy feeling that I was,ep066
1521,really looking for mark loves the,ep066
1524,bathroom after being married for ten,ep066
1527,years we finally got our own place,ep066
1530,together and it feels really good I'm,ep066
1533,super excited,ep066
1536,[Music],ep066
12,this is amazing I love these countertops,ep067
15,this is a gorgeous kitchen reach and,ep067
18,Andrew are hunting for their first home,ep067
21,in the heart of Philadelphia oh nice,ep067
24,classic Philly real home but can they,ep067
27,get an updated place what the finishes,ep067
30,they like within their budget,ep067
33,I really dislike every piece of it it's,ep067
36,dark on dark on dark that corner shower,ep067
39,is a Star Trek we're gonna close the,ep067
42,door be like beating me up Scotty when,ep067
45,you said bedroom did you get confused,ep067
48,with closet small but functional only,ep067
51,looks a little like an airplane bathroom,ep067
54,and as far as getting a usable outdoor,ep067
57,space close to downtown dirt the glass,ep067
60,dispenses terrible on the verge of being,ep067
63,a deal breaker,ep067
66,[Music],ep067
69,[Applause],ep067
72,I have a feeling I am not gonna win this,ep067
75,game probably not I'm rich I am a flight,ep067
78,attendant for a major US airline I'm,ep067
81,Andrew hi I'm also a flight attendant,ep067
84,that we're both based in Philadelphia,ep067
87,you got this no I don't Andrew and I,ep067
90,first met about three years ago when I,ep067
93,was working a flight to Nashville and he,ep067
96,conveniently was flying as a passenger,ep067
99,in my exit row and after talking the,ep067
102,entire flight he said hey let's grab,ep067
105,dinner tonight while you're in Nashville,ep067
108,and we've pretty much been dating ever,ep067
111,since we are getting married in five,ep067
114,months there's an amazing Aviation,ep067
117,Museum that we want to get married at is,ep067
120,it comfortable it's pretty comfortable,ep067
123,what better place for two flight,ep067
126,attendants to get married than a museum,ep067
129,full of airplanes yeah I think we'll,ep067
132,disagree on the comfort Philadelphia is,ep067
135,a great city because it's got the hustle,ep067
138,and bustle but still kind of that small,ep067
141,city charm it is really a melting pot of,ep067
144,different cultures and activities but,ep067
147,you know you still run into people that,ep067
150,you know on the street so it's kind of,ep067
153,the best of both worlds history the food,ep067
156,it's an amazing city they just need to,ep067
159,get out of their rental and into a home,ep067
162,of their own currently we live in,ep067
165,Rittenhouse Square which is a great,ep067
168,neighborhood that has lots of,ep067
171,restaurants shopping so I think we,ep067
174,focused our search on downtown South,ep067
177,Philly we wanted to have pretty easy,ep067
180,access to the city I'd rather have a,ep067
183,brick home I agree like that would be,ep067
186,nice the style house that I'm looking,ep067
189,for is loft feel open floor plan exposed,ep067
192,brick exposed duct working very,ep067
195,modern-looking rich on the other hand,ep067
198,prefers the classic style of a cape,ep067
201,cause I grew up in Boston so that New,ep067
204,England charm is something that I really,ep067
207,am looking for in a house so I'm,ep067
210,definitely looking more first a house,ep067
213,that I can call home since I grew up in,ep067
216,an apartment,ep067
219,but given the location of central Philly,ep067
222,where they'd like to stay they know a,ep067
225,row house may be a more realistic option,ep067
228,a churchman row house would be nice,ep067
231,something with little details and,ep067
234,architecture something you know where we,ep067
237,can just walk into the main level maybe,ep067
240,a couple of steps with Andrew and I both,ep067
243,traveling for work you know we're always,ep067
246,taught suitcases and luggage,ep067
249,carrying things in and out of the house,ep067
252,second bedroom is an absolute must we,ep067
255,are looking for two bedrooms two,ep067
258,bathrooms the second bath is,ep067
261,super-important to me our only bathroom,ep067
264,in our apartment is in our bedroom which,ep067
267,is upstairs so the entire house has to,ep067
270,stay clean for people to use the,ep067
273,bathroom,ep067
276,so having guests over is not something,ep067
279,we do on the regular because I don't,ep067
282,want to clean the whole house before it,ep067
285,I really hope that Regina can find,ep067
288,something fast in our price range that,ep067
291,works we have a budget of about two,ep067
294,hundred and fifty thousand we're hoping,ep067
297,to come in a little bit lower than we,ep067
300,can always customize the other stuff,ep067
303,later,ep067
306,the most important thing for me is that,ep067
309,it's move-in ready and doesn't require a,ep067
312,lot of work I am NOT the most handy,ep067
315,person in the world so I want something,ep067
318,that I can just bring my furniture into,ep067
321,and call it home I also would really,ep067
324,like to have some sort of outdoor space,ep067
327,I don't really want to ardor any outdoor,ep067
330,space to take care of I would prefer,ep067
333,that it be a deck off of a second-story,ep067
336,somewhere you know how important the,ep067
339,kitchen is to me too I'd also really,ep067
342,like a big open kitchen I love when,ep067
345,kitchens are open into the main living,ep067
348,area I really want gas appliances those,ep067
351,are really important to me and if we,ep067
354,could have some sort of fireplace would,ep067
357,really enjoy that also high on their,ep067
360,list is a finished basement some usable,ep067
363,living space in the basement would be,ep067
366,nice I also really would enjoy some sort,ep067
369,of laundry space I just hope we find,ep067
372,something without any carpet I think,ep067
375,it's grass I live in a house with,ep067
378,someone else's carpet definitely,ep067
381,hardwood floors would be something that,ep067
384,I would like to have I don't like,ep067
387,putting my feet down on cold floors in,ep067
390,the morning so carpet in the bedrooms,ep067
393,would be great hey guys how's it going,ep067
396,hey fantastic it's really important for,ep067
399,us to have a home especially with our,ep067
402,jobs so having a place that's really our,ep067
405,own that we can come home to at the end,ep067
408,of a long week of being apart I think is,ep067
411,really important for both of us,ep067
414,this is the house right here to the left,ep067
417,first up a traditional row house the,ep067
420,area is a couple blocks away from,ep067
423,University City so your little bit,ep067
426,outside Philadelphia Adelia they would,ep067
429,like to be where they currently live in,ep067
432,Rittenhouse Square however they know,ep067
435,that that's not in their budget so we're,ep067
438,still trying to figure out exactly what,ep067
441,neighborhood is the right choice for,ep067
444,them oh nice I love that porch,ep067
447,oh look it even has a garage it's three,ep067
450,bedrooms two and a half baths and just,ep067
453,"over 1,300 square feet and it is listed",ep067
456,it at a hundred and ninety five thousand,ep067
459,very good yeah well I did like the curb,ep067
462,appeal in this house I was worried that,ep067
465,there are a lot of steps with Andrew and,ep067
468,I both carrying suitcases for work I,ep067
471,think that could be an issue oh wow,ep067
474,Magina,ep067
477,this is amazing I'm stunned by these,ep067
480,floors these floors are amazing he's,ep067
483,exposed brick and the metal railings on,ep067
486,the stairwell really add a very modern,ep067
489,touch which is what I was looking for,ep067
492,yeah I like how they kept some of the,ep067
495,traditional elements with the brick and,ep067
498,the wood it's great I really love the,ep067
501,gas fireplace that's a really nice touch,ep067
504,but the textured table behind it it's,ep067
507,really beautiful I feel like there's so,ep067
510,much space in this room we're gonna have,ep067
513,to go shopping for more furniture no no,ep067
516,no you're shopping okay don't over here,ep067
519,actually we have the half bathroom oh,ep067
522,nice right here on the first floor,ep067
525,that's great definitely small but,ep067
528,functional or he's just fine only looks,ep067
531,a little like an airplane bathroom I,ep067
534,never here we have our dining room area,ep067
537,pitifully interesting here a lot more,ep067
540,than we do in our current small city,ep067
543,apartment absolutely yeah I really like,ep067
546,these windows over here too this isn't,ep067
549,something you see a whole lot in a row,ep067
552,house yeah nice and bright in here this,ep067
555,backsplash over here is beautiful these,ep067
558,cabinets are really nice I have to be,ep067
561,honest I really dislike every piece of,ep067
564,it it's dark on dark on dark I do wish,ep067
567,they picked a different countertops,ep067
570,something lighter to brighten it up and,ep067
573,here would have been nice it's got the,ep067
576,gas appliances which you know oh yeah,ep067
579,love and I think we have room for a,ep067
582,turkey yes please they walk through the,ep067
585,laundry room and head out to see the,ep067
588,yard,ep067
591,you have a finished duct space back here,ep067
594,oh yeah this is pretty nice I like that,ep067
597,we're not gonna have to mow this yeah I,ep067
600,feel like the only thing missing is an,ep067
603,umbrella drink to finish off this Tiki,ep067
606,vibe yeah that fence would have to go I,ep067
609,think we could use a little more privacy,ep067
612,than that I don't particularly want any,ep067
615,outdoor space I think with rich and I,ep067
618,traveling so much that it's just,ep067
621,something else that we have to take care,ep067
624,of back inside they head downstairs to,ep067
627,see the basement all right there's not a,ep067
630,lot going on down here it's not really,ep067
633,livable space but at least there's,ep067
636,plenty of storage and you do have access,ep067
639,to your garage over there,ep067
642,oh that would be nice yeah they head,ep067
645,upstairs to the second floor to see the,ep067
648,master okay,ep067
651,very nice I really don't like the carpet,ep067
654,in here at all though I don't even think,ep067
657,it's a good color that's something that,ep067
660,could be easily removed let's take a,ep067
663,look at the master bathroom okay don't,ep067
666,worry I do like that there's a bathroom,ep067
669,off the master bedroom for sure but I'm,ep067
672,not sure about some of the finishes in,ep067
675,here or that corner shower is a Star,ep067
678,Trek we're gonna close the door and be,ep067
681,like beam me up Scotty they see another,ep067
684,full bath and a small bedroom before,ep067
687,seeing the last bedroom I like the,ep067
690,natural light in here I think this is a,ep067
693,lot nicer than the master bedroom,ep067
696,honestly you know there's two closets I,ep067
699,think we could do like a his in his,ep067
702,closet situation which would be nice,ep067
705,honestly I think this is the best room,ep067
708,on this floor I really liked the open,ep067
711,floor plan and you know I was,ep067
714,immediately drawn to the exposed brick,ep067
717,and the railings going up the stairs,ep067
720,although I am a little bit worried about,ep067
723,how many stairs just coming alone into,ep067
726,the house with all of our suitcases and,ep067
729,things like that,ep067
732,I am concerned with the neighborhood,ep067
735,it's a little further out than we want,ep067
738,it to be you know I definitely think the,ep067
741,neighborhood is a big factor with this,ep067
744,one I honestly love the placement of the,ep067
747,washer and dryer too so nice to have it,ep067
750,on the first floor I did like that that,ep067
753,backyard area was finished there was,ep067
756,that deck no real maintenance back there,ep067
759,which would be really nice so now,ep067
762,they're seeing a Cape Cod for rich but I,ep067
765,know I said I wanted a yard Regina but,ep067
768,this is overkill I was not,ep067
771,looking for,ep067
774,[Music],ep067
777,[Applause],ep067
780,[Music],ep067
783,[Applause],ep067
786,I would love to live in a neighborhood,ep067
789,like this,ep067
792,lots of shopping all these different,ep067
795,restaurants flight attendants Andrew and,ep067
798,rich are hunting for their first home in,ep067
801,Philadelphia with a budget of two,ep067
804,hundred and fifty thousand dollars rich,ep067
807,is hoping for a cape cod-style with lots,ep067
810,of charm and outdoor space while Andrew,ep067
813,wants a more modern loft style house,ep067
816,with a finished basement so far they've,ep067
819,seen an updated row house with a nice,ep067
822,outdoor space and a laundry room,ep067
825,but it was outside their target,ep067
828,neighborhood and didn't have a useable,ep067
831,basement now their agents showing them a,ep067
834,cape cod-style house for rich I know you,ep067
837,said you're interested in the Cape Cod,ep067
840,so I wanted to bring you out to see the,ep067
843,single-family Cape cod-style home could,ep067
846,you have gotten us any further away from,ep067
849,the city it's only 30 minutes from the,ep067
852,city were in Northeast Philly,ep067
855,it's not that far I know I said I wanted,ep067
858,a yard Regina but this is overkill I was,ep067
861,not looking for a farm well I just want,ep067
864,you guys to check it out it's five,ep067
867,bedrooms two full baths recently,ep067
870,"rehabbed over 1,500 square feet and it",ep067
873,"is listed at $250,000 I mean that's at",ep067
876,the top of our budget it better be,ep067
879,beautiful inside growing up in New,ep067
882,England I was drawn more into the Cape,ep067
885,Cod style homes but the location in this,ep067
888,house really doesn't work for me it's,ep067
891,too far outside of the city and it's way,ep067
894,too far from work okay I do like how,ep067
897,open an area it is in here this kind of,ep067
900,creates a nice layout for entertaining,ep067
903,if we had guests honestly the openness,ep067
906,is the only thing I really liked in this,ep067
909,room these laminate floors look cheap,ep067
912,yeah these laminate floors would,ep067
915,definitely have to go let's check out,ep067
918,the kitchen don't you guys think of this,ep067
921,I really like the layout of this kitchen,ep067
924,you know I think the island here is nice,ep067
927,does that gas house with appliances yeah,ep067
930,it looks like this is a nice big gas,ep067
933,stove for you good I love the backsplash,ep067
936,in the granite the cabinets are a little,ep067
939,dated maybe a little farmhouse to me I,ep067
942,definitely think this has a little bit,ep067
945,of a grand mouth feel that I'm not crazy,ep067
948,about you also have your dining room,ep067
951,space over here to the right okay it's,ep067
954,pretty small in here though I'm not even,ep067
957,sure you can fit a dining table in here,ep067
960,plus we have to go buy one anyway this,ep067
963,is just a wasted space to me the only,ep067
966,thing that I like about this room is,ep067
969,that light fixture I really wish it,ep067
972,would have been put somewhere else in,ep067
975,the house that is a cool light fixture,ep067
978,you know let's check out the master,ep067
981,bedroom,ep067
984,closet space here all right that works,ep067
987,all right,ep067
990,good size and then this is the master,ep067
993,bedroom this master bedroom is right off,ep067
996,of the dining room that doesn't make any,ep067
999,sense but it is a good-sized space so,ep067
1002,there is that plus they passed through,ep067
1005,the laundry room I really like that the,ep067
1008,laundry was on the first floor that was,ep067
1011,a really good placement especially with,ep067
1014,all the bags that rich and I have to,ep067
1017,carry for work so this is your master,ep067
1020,bathroom shared bathroom space this,ep067
1023,seems like a really weird layout I'm not,ep067
1026,sure about this at all it's cramped and,ep067
1029,I can't believe this is the only,ep067
1032,bathroom on the first floor yeah so this,ep067
1035,bathroom is gonna be shared with your,ep067
1038,guests and your master bedroom I mean I,ep067
1041,guess I like the finishes in here this,ep067
1044,tile is really beautiful weird that,ep067
1047,there's no medicine cabinet and like so,ep067
1050,little storage in this room and the lack,ep067
1053,of tub is very confusing to me to,ep067
1056,attempt would have been a lot nicer for,ep067
1059,this master bathroom if you can call it,ep067
1062,that right they look at a bedroom before,ep067
1065,heading upstairs to see another bedroom,ep067
1068,when you said bedroom did you get,ep067
1071,confused with closet Stillings are a,ep067
1074,little bit low can be used as a bedroom,ep067
1077,space where it makes sense check out the,ep067
1080,next bedroom over here to your right,ep067
1083,wait Regina I think we're gonna have to,ep067
1086,talk about your definition of a bedroom,ep067
1089,because this is not it I mean I think,ep067
1092,you could fit a bed in here but that's,ep067
1095,literally the only thing that would fit,ep067
1098,in here and here we go with the,ep067
1101,carpeting I don't like this at all I,ep067
1104,actually really like the carpet slope,ep067
1107,I'll it'll be easy to clean I don't,ep067
1110,think it was a bad choice no I just know,ep067
1113,I don't like it just no no that's it,ep067
1116,they look at a full bath before seeing,ep067
1119,the last bedroom now this is what I'd,ep067
1122,call a bedroom yeah this size is,ep067
1125,definitely something we could work with,ep067
1128,and check out the storage space behind,ep067
1131,these closet doors oh nice oh wow okay,ep067
1134,there's a lot of storage space in here,ep067
1137,although I'm not sure we could hang any,ep067
1140,clothing in here with the sloped,ep067
1143,ceilings no does it go all the way,ep067
1146,through or is it separated yes it goes,ep067
1149,all the way through oh good,ep067
1152,[Music],ep067
1155,when we first walked up I was,ep067
1158,immediately worried about how much,ep067
1161,outdoor space we had because we didn't,ep067
1164,want a yard this big or at all and the,ep067
1167,drive out here from the city was really,ep067
1170,far it did have a little bit of curb,ep067
1173,appeal which was nice,ep067
1176,everything in here seems pretty modern,ep067
1179,and updated for the most part which is,ep067
1182,nice there was stuffing something we,ep067
1185,were looking for it so now they're,ep067
1188,finally seeing a place in their target,ep067
1191,neighborhood but what's this giant hole,ep067
1194,whose responsibilities at,ep067
1197,[Music],ep067
1200,maybe I'll get beginner's luck you don't,ep067
1203,know Andrew and rich are looking for,ep067
1206,their first house with a two hundred and,ep067
1209,fifty thousand dollar budget in,ep067
1212,Philadelphia they've seen an updated row,ep067
1215,house with modern features a nice,ep067
1218,outdoor space at a laundry room but it,ep067
1221,wasn't in their target location then,ep067
1224,they saw a cape cod that was 30 minutes,ep067
1227,from the city and the yard was much,ep067
1230,larger than they wanted but it had a,ep067
1233,first-floor laundry room and minimal,ep067
1236,stairs,ep067
1239,now they're seeing another row house,ep067
1242,this time right in central Philly so,ep067
1245,this is the house right up here oh nice,ep067
1248,classic Philly real home I like that,ep067
1251,what's this giant hole whose,ep067
1254,responsibility is that this is probably,ep067
1257,the city's responsibility so nothing you,ep067
1260,guys will have to worry about okay so,ep067
1263,this is recently rehabbed two bedrooms,ep067
1266,one and a half baths and is listed at,ep067
1269,"200,000 well under budget within our",ep067
1272,budget that's great the row home is nice,ep067
1275,it sits right on the street which is,ep067
1278,easy for getting bags in so I really,ep067
1281,enjoyed that aspect have a nice moderate,ep067
1284,open layout it does we wanted that,ep067
1287,beautiful floors I love the big,ep067
1290,baseboards those are really nice I wish,ep067
1293,they did some crown molding up top or,ep067
1296,maybe some more detail to keep the charm,ep067
1299,of the home behind you do you think it,ep067
1302,was covering up a fireplace do you think,ep067
1305,we can find yeah it might have been this,ep067
1308,homes built in 1925 so there could have,ep067
1311,been a possible fireplace right there,ep067
1314,true we can check into that I'm just not,ep067
1317,sure if all of our furnitures gonna fit,ep067
1320,in here as is I was just wondering the,ep067
1323,same thing but I think it's really small,ep067
1326,and we're gonna be tied to furniture,ep067
1329,placement we're not gonna have room for,ep067
1332,a dining room table or he's feeding on a,ep067
1335,counter for dinner,ep067
1338,I guess it's counter eating gonna be,ep067
1341,okay for us yeah yeah can work so let's,ep067
1344,go and take a look at the kitchen now I,ep067
1347,love these countertops this is a,ep067
1350,gorgeous kitchen tons of cabinets,ep067
1353,I love these glass cabinets over here I,ep067
1356,do really like these light fixtures what,ep067
1359,do you think I agree I really like them,ep067
1362,they are very modern,ep067
1365,all right the subway tile as well I,ep067
1368,really like how it plays with the,ep067
1371,countertops and look at this oven gas,ep067
1374,stove this is great this is just what,ep067
1377,you want it it is it's exactly what I,ep067
1380,wanted down the halls they see the half,ep067
1383,bath well this is great I love the,ep067
1386,finishes yeah very nice over here you,ep067
1389,have two exit to the backyard,ep067
1392,okay have a nice private backyard space,ep067
1395,I was really looking for something more,ep067
1398,finished like a patio or a deck or,ep067
1401,something with low-maintenance that we,ep067
1404,didn't have to worry about I mean this,ep067
1407,is just awful dirt the glass this fence,ep067
1410,is terrible stucco is awful it's on the,ep067
1413,verge of being a deal breaker they head,ep067
1416,back inside to see the basement,ep067
1419,oh this basement is not finished at all,ep067
1422,I'm not even sure we could use this,ep067
1425,space for how low the ceiling is too,ep067
1428,there is a washer and dryer hookup but,ep067
1431,with as dirty as it is down here I'm not,ep067
1434,sure I would store anything I don't,ep067
1437,think this is gonna work at all for us,ep067
1440,the basement in this house is terrible,ep067
1443,there isn't even enough room to sand,ep067
1446,nothing is finished and there isn't even,ep067
1449,a functional washer and dryer unit they,ep067
1452,head upstairs to the second floor to see,ep067
1455,a full bath this is a great sized,ep067
1458,bathroom I do like that everything's,ep067
1461,clean and new and modern yeah I really,ep067
1464,love the subway tile they look at the,ep067
1467,first bedroom before seeing the master,ep067
1470,this is great size I think our furniture,ep067
1473,should fit fine in here yeah I really,ep067
1476,like the size the two windows are really,ep067
1479,great they have the nice baseboards,ep067
1482,carpet I'm not a huge fan of the carpet,ep067
1485,but as long as it's not in the main,ep067
1488,floor I guess we can compromise on that,ep067
1491,storage space over here mm-hmm,ep067
1494,oh yeah this isn't bad yeah I like the,ep067
1497,size of these closets very nice closet,ep067
1500,yeah I love that kitchen all the details,ep067
1503,of it shows are really beautiful it is,ep067
1506,close to downtown which is nice so we're,ep067
1509,not too far from all the things that we,ep067
1512,love about Philadelphia,ep067
1515,the backyard the class all the mess that,ep067
1518,was out there yeah I was hoping for an,ep067
1521,outdoor space that was a little more,ep067
1524,finished I'm definitely concerned about,ep067
1527,the basement too we were really hoping,ep067
1530,for a nice finished laundry area that,ep067
1533,was ready to go after seeing several,ep067
1536,options it's time for them to decide the,ep067
1539,choice may come down to whether the,ep067
1542,house is close to their target location,ep067
1545,has a laundry room or has a backyard,ep067
1548,that appeals to them we should probably,ep067
1551,make a decision on one of these houses,ep067
1554,before we lose them,ep067
1557,[Music],ep067
1560,andrew and rich are looking for a home,ep067
1563,in philadelphia within their 250,ep067
1566,thousand dollar budget they've seen,ep067
1569,several options and now it's time to,ep067
1572,decide I really liked that gray row I'm,ep067
1575,"listening 195,000 it definitely combined",ep067
1578,the traditional elements of rural home,ep067
1581,with the modern elements as well that's,ep067
1584,the one that had the washer and dryer in,ep067
1587,the back of the house on the first floor,ep067
1590,which would be great I also really liked,ep067
1593,that this house had outdoor space it did,ep067
1596,have a nice new finished deck and there,ep067
1599,wouldn't be a lot to take care of there,ep067
1602,I didn't really care for the,ep067
1605,neighborhood plus it's not even anywhere,ep067
1608,near the restaurants and shopping and,ep067
1611,all the usual places we like to hang out,ep067
1614,in Philadelphia let's talk about the,ep067
1617,"Cape Cod the house is listed at 250,000",ep067
1620,which is top of our budget I think it's,ep067
1623,really far outside of the city there was,ep067
1626,a huge yard with so much maintenance,ep067
1629,that kitchen I did love that layout that,ep067
1632,Island was great for gathering and,ep067
1635,having people around Plus remember that,ep067
1638,had the washer and dryer in the first,ep067
1641,floor which would be great when we carry,ep067
1644,in our bags okay the red brick row home,ep067
1647,that's listed at two hundred thousand,ep067
1650,like that home that kitchen was,ep067
1653,beautiful I didn't like that backyard at,ep067
1656,all and the amount of time that we're,ep067
1659,gonna have to spend out there cleaning,ep067
1662,it up what about that basement that,ep067
1665,basement was rough plus the washer and,ep067
1668,dryer setup was there but we'd still,ep067
1671,have to buy the appliances I do love the,ep067
1674,upstairs the room size was great the,ep067
1677,bathroom upstairs was really nice and I,ep067
1680,really like the location of that row,ep067
1683,house with the proximity to downtown,ep067
1686,yeah that definitely drew me to this,ep067
1689,house too,ep067
1692,I personally I'm leaning more towards,ep067
1695,the red brick row house it's the perfect,ep067
1698,size we can really just move right in,ep067
1701,plus I think that that neighborhood is a,ep067
1704,little more accessible for both of us,ep067
1707,and closer to all the restaurants and,ep067
1710,shopping so then it's settled we're,ep067
1713,going with the red brick row house I,ep067
1716,think that's a great idea,ep067
1719,we definitely should we put in an offer,ep067
1722,on the house about five months ago we,ep067
1725,closed about a month ago and we just,ep067
1728,moved in last week all right,ep067
1731,looks good the asking price was two and,ep067
1734,a thousand and we ended up paying two,ep067
1737,hundred and ten but this right over here,ep067
1740,we'd primarily picked this house because,ep067
1743,of the location to the city for only,ep067
1746,about a mile from Rittenhouse Square,ep067
1749,which was our preferred neighborhood it,ep067
1752,was just that perfect sweet spot for us,ep067
1755,so you're leaving tomorrow right yeah,ep067
1758,I've got a trip tomorrow morning it one,ep067
1761,compromise I feel like I made with this,ep067
1764,house is that we didn't really have much,ep067
1767,of a yard space at all right now it's,ep067
1770,just a small patch of dirt so when we're,ep067
1773,thinking about putting up a patio you,ep067
1776,can enjoy the outdoor space in the,ep067
1779,summer the mall out just in case I don't,ep067
1782,know how hungry they are some of the,ep067
1785,major compromises that I made in this,ep067
1788,house was the lack of usable basement,ep067
1791,space with the low ceilings there's no,ep067
1794,way that we can turn into anything other,ep067
1797,than storage or laundry facilities that,ep067
1800,looks good I think my favorite room in,ep067
1803,the house is actually the kitchen it's,ep067
1806,just a great space for us we have the,ep067
1809,barstools that we can sit at and chat,ep067
1812,and make dinner and we really enjoyed,ep067
1815,sharing that space together having only,ep067
1818,one staircase has been amazing being,ep067
1821,able to roll the bag into the front door,ep067
1824,and right up the stairs has been a dream,ep067
1827,I'm excited to know that since we're,ep067
1830,getting married in a few months that we,ep067
1833,get to come home to a completely,ep067
1836,furnished house and not have to worry,ep067
1839,about this process in a year or so it's,ep067
1842,all done for us already,ep067
1845,there we go,ep067
1848,[Applause],ep067

15,love what the curb ceilings totally of,ep068
18,the era 1940s real estate broker Sarah,ep068
21,loves vintage everything so her new,ep068
24,house in Chico California has to measure,ep068
27,up looks like potentially remodeled in,ep068
30,the 90s not my favorite she's willing to,ep068
33,take on a renault to get the look she,ep068
36,wants it's got a lot of character and,ep068
39,bringing it back to the era would be,ep068
42,awesome okay but her friend Laura thinks,ep068
45,that's a bad plan it needs a lot of work,ep068
48,Sarah I don't know can you fit all this,ep068
51,in in the time frame that you need to,ep068
54,get it done in and you really you don't,ep068
57,have time to do a Reno yes I do have,ep068
60,time to do it right now if I want to I,ep068
63,can do one,ep068
66,[Music],ep068
69,so for all the style of the house this,ep068
72,is considered a storybook so it's got,ep068
75,the high roof and a lot of character,ep068
78,that you guys have been looking for my,ep068
81,name is Sarah I am a real estate broker,ep068
84,and I live in Chico California that's,ep068
87,nice it's close to downtown town so,ep068
90,you've got you know all those like the,ep068
93,best options right around here in close,ep068
96,distance I'm originally from the Bay,ep068
99,Area but I've been here in Chico for,ep068
102,about 24 years I absolutely love our,ep068
105,town there's tons of Arts we also have,ep068
108,the third largest park in all of,ep068
111,California which is big well park lots,ep068
114,of nature but we still have the city and,ep068
117,we still have shopping and restaurants,ep068
120,you guys hungry,ep068
123,awesome I have two sons back in Drew,ep068
126,they just actually graduated this year,ep068
129,from Chico State I'm super proud of that,ep068
132,you want a little bit me look in the,ep068
135,last six months I went through a divorce,ep068
138,so life has changed a little bit,ep068
141,I'm currently renting back the house,ep068
144,from my ex-husband that I used to own,ep068
147,with him but she only has a couple of,ep068
150,months left in that house so she's asked,ep068
153,her friend and colleague Laura to help,ep068
156,her find a new place fast we spend a lot,ep068
159,of time looking at homes together so I,ep068
162,know what she's looking for,ep068
165,it's true she's really good at pulling,ep068
168,the reins back sometimes I get maybe a,ep068
171,little bit too excited and it's totally,ep068
174,too excited she'll calm me down just a,ep068
177,little bit which I need sometimes misses,ep068
180,like a vintage oh my god I love that,ep068
183,isn't that great I definitely have a,ep068
186,tendency to go for vintage clothes,ep068
189,vintage jewelry I definitely need to,ep068
192,have a vintage home that you know,ep068
195,matches my vintage life something like,ep068
198,this would be really nice it's you know,ep068
201,mid-century modern first choice would be,ep068
204,mid-century modern I absolutely love,ep068
207,hardwood floors and it usually will have,ep068
210,some type of interesting aesthetic on,ep068
213,the outside whether it be brick or it,ep068
216,could be shingles you know a little bit,ep068
219,more flavor compared to newer kind of,ep068
222,cookie cutter homes,ep068
225,she's also open to craftsman or bungalow,ep068
228,as long as it has a good setup for,ep068
231,entertaining I love to cook I love to,ep068
234,have friends over so it needs to really,ep068
237,fit my,ep068
240,our lifestyle even if I need to fix it,ep068
243,up and make it my own I would be totally,ep068
246,fine with that I'm open to a fixer-upper,ep068
249,I would love to do something you know,ep068
252,from the ground up the way that I would,ep068
255,like it to look doing something that has,ep068
258,a lot of construction involved is gonna,ep068
261,be a mistake because you don't have a,ep068
264,lot of time unless you want to live in,ep068
267,the Renault she said her budget at,ep068
270,"$600,000 and for that she wants at least",ep068
273,three bedrooms and two baths since her,ep068
276,boys will still be living with her for a,ep068
279,while as well as a great location I,ep068
282,really want to be by Bedwell Park I can,ep068
285,take my little dog meatloaf on a walk I,ep068
288,would be open definitely to being by,ep068
291,downtown as well they have very,ep068
294,beautiful vintage homes downtown I'd,ep068
297,probably be open to the avenues too and,ep068
300,it's not by the park but definitely has,ep068
303,some of Chico's most beautiful vintage,ep068
306,craftsman homes I wonder if it has a,ep068
309,pool though cuz you know if it doesn't,ep068
312,have a pool it's a no-go I think sirs,ep068
315,leaving something off that list it's a,ep068
318,pool you need a pool in Chico well I,ep068
321,need a pool and she go to as long as it,ep068
324,has a yard maybe big enough to put one,ep068
327,in ago this is gonna be the first time,ep068
330,that I have owned a home all myself you,ep068
333,know before I always had to compromise a,ep068
336,little bit on what I wanted and I'm,ep068
339,really excited that this time you know I,ep068
342,don't have to compromise on anything I,ep068
345,get to pick every single aspect of the,ep068
348,home and make sure that it's what I want,ep068
351,since she loves vintage she's starting,ep068
354,off at a classic 1940s bungalow I love,ep068
357,the location here it's right by downtown,ep068
360,so I could walk to go out to dinner yeah,ep068
363,you're about what eight blocks from the,ep068
366,park here yep it's it's pretty close and,ep068
369,you know I love that 1940s look it's got,ep068
372,the little scalloped you know siding on,ep068
375,it it could be really cute yeah but look,ep068
378,at the yard it's gonna need a lot of,ep068
381,work well the entire house needs a lot,ep068
384,of work let's just be you know real with,ep068
387,that so it's a two bedroom one bath and,ep068
390,then it's got a little guest hannett in,ep068
393,the back one bedroom one bath and it's,ep068
396,260 thousand way below the budget and,ep068
399,definitely would be a really good,ep068
402,investment I could do anything I wanted,ep068
405,with it maybe expand yeah you're gonna,ep068
408,have to sell me on this one for sure,ep068
411,this is so cute look at the ceiling I,ep068
414,love when it's the curb ceilings totally,ep068
417,of the era 1940s the floors look to be,ep068
420,original and they're actually in really,ep068
423,good condition with a little mail slot,ep068
426,super-cute,ep068
429,we'll have to see the rest of the house,ep068
432,I don't know this is pretty tiny you,ep068
435,know it's to the era of the home and I,ep068
438,love 1940 little bungalows this would be,ep068
441,what I would get in this home and then,ep068
444,it's got you know this adorable built-in,ep068
447,right here I can totally picture like,ep068
450,all my vintage bar wares in here I don't,ep068
453,see the space working for you at all I,ep068
456,think it's gonna be too small maybe I,ep068
459,use this space as the dining room,ep068
462,instead yeah it might work oh I love the,ep068
465,archway this is cute this kitchen is,ep068
468,ridiculous haha,ep068
471,Sarah loves to entertain and cook she is,ep068
474,not going to be able to cook in that,ep068
477,kitchen it's gonna make her nuts it's,ep068
480,got a lot of character and bringing it,ep068
483,back to the area would be awesome,ep068
486,okay here's one of the bedrooms and LA,ep068
489,I'm not sure if this would be the master,ep068
492,if there's hopefully maybe a little bit,ep068
495,of a bigger option for the master but it,ep068
498,gets good light it seems pretty small to,ep068
501,me well here is the one and only,ep068
504,bathroom Oh yikes,ep068
507,this is really bad actually I agree with,ep068
510,you it's it's pretty bad so this,ep068
513,obviously a total gut job definitely on,ep068
516,the smaller side I think this actually,ep068
519,might be a little bit smaller than the,ep068
522,back bedroom oh I mean this is a really,ep068
525,big backyard there's plenty of room to,ep068
528,still have a outdoor space for meatloaf,ep068
531,and my pool and our pool in just be your,ep068
534,pool although you can pay for the pool,ep068
537,let me throw it in and the lot is,ep068
540,definitely big enough that if I wanted,ep068
543,to out on a big master suite it could be,ep068
546,really awesome it's nice,ep068
549,I like the blue door oh I mean this,ep068
552,space is much nicer than I was actually,ep068
555,thinking it was gonna be from the,ep068
558,outside you know the boys they would,ep068
561,fight over the space cuz I feel like,ep068
564,having your own apartment you know on,ep068
567,the property,ep068
570,I absolutely love the age and that it,ep068
573,hasn't really been touched so I could,ep068
576,actually make it my own,ep068
579,it needs a lot of work Sarah I don't,ep068
582,know can you fit all this in in the time,ep068
585,frame that you need to get it done in I,ep068
588,potentially might have to find somewhere,ep068
591,to temporarily stay while I do,ep068
594,renovations here or I could try and,ep068
597,tough it out and stay in the back myself,ep068
600,since that's not an ideal option she's,ep068
603,now found a place that's a little more,ep068
606,move-in ready it's built in 1960 but,ep068
609,they did remodel it it's a flip so I'm a,ep068
612,little nervous about what type of,ep068
615,finishes they did and if they kind of,ep068
618,kept with the originality of the house,ep068
621,itself,ep068
624,[Music],ep068
627,lift your arms up high above head,ep068
630,stretch through your fingertips starts,ep068
633,through your toes real estate broker,ep068
636,"sarah has a $600,000 budget for a house",ep068
639,in Chico California,ep068
642,deep inhale let it go out the mouth,ep068
645,exhale with her friend Laura along for,ep068
648,advice and support she's seen a 1940's,ep068
651,bungalow near downtown with lots of the,ep068
654,vintage charm that she wants but Laura,ep068
657,thought it needed more work than Sarah,ep068
660,could handle so now she's found a place,ep068
663,that's been recently remodeled this,ep068
666,one's awfully cute Sarah and it's two,ep068
669,blocks from my house I know I love that,ep068
672,right and it's right across from Bidwell,ep068
675,Park and the aesthetics are super-cute,ep068
678,you know it's got a little bit of,ep068
681,mid-century Flair it's definitely a,ep068
684,ranch home it's built in 1960 but they,ep068
687,did remodel it it's a flip so I'm a,ep068
690,little nervous about what type of,ep068
693,finishes they did and if they kind of,ep068
696,kept with the originality of the house,ep068
699,itself does it have a pool it doesn't,ep068
702,have a page it might have room to add,ep068
705,one though whatever look right what's,ep068
708,the price the price is actually really,ep068
711,good for being right by the park it's,ep068
714,$4.99 oh that's awesome yeah I'm pretty,ep068
717,excited to see it well this definitely,ep068
720,looks a little bit like a flipped,ep068
723,kitchen oh and it's a galley you're used,ep068
726,to having a big kitchen I know this is,ep068
729,gonna work on excuse me out just a,ep068
732,little bit thinking about it and I,ep068
735,definitely do not like the tile it's you,ep068
738,know super just ordinary and really,ep068
741,doesn't have any of that 60s vibe just a,ep068
744,little boring for me in here it's all,ep068
747,neutral and you really you don't have,ep068
750,time to do a Reno yes I do have time to,ep068
753,do it right now if I want to I can do,ep068
756,one okay especially if it's just you,ep068
759,know maybe a little little something not,ep068
762,the whole thing this space is a little,ep068
765,odd to me over here you can't really,ep068
768,like fit a table but it's not a light,ep068
771,you don't care for the light either,ep068
774,definitely not 1960s I love the hardwood,ep068
777,floors these are beautiful,ep068
780,youtell they look like they're original,ep068
783,but unfortunately again I hate a light,ep068
786,fixture I know what's up with you it's,ep068
789,just not to the era of the house they,ep068
792,could have done so much more with us you,ep068
795,know and really brought it back to the,ep068
798,60s which I would have loved I do like,ep068
801,the overalls,ep068
804,this is definitely big enough where I,ep068
807,can have a big table I can have you know,ep068
810,a bunch of friends over they pass,ep068
813,through the family room on their way to,ep068
816,the backyard do you think there's enough,ep068
819,space back here to add a pool,ep068
822,I'm maybe you could have a small little,ep068
825,you know wading pool it's hot and Chico,ep068
828,in the summertime we're looking at a,ep068
831,hundred and eight degrees and no pool so,ep068
834,you know that's a little bit of a,ep068
837,downside for this house and here I guess,ep068
840,is the guest best fight and bright I do,ep068
843,like the skylight and then the vanity is,ep068
846,got to go if I was to get this house,ep068
849,it's definitely more modern and you know,ep068
852,doesn't look 60s same with you know,ep068
855,pretty much all of the fixtures inside,ep068
858,of here down the hall they see two,ep068
861,bedrooms for the boys been head to the,ep068
864,master master I'm used to a much bigger,ep068
867,bedroom than that's a king-size bed I,ep068
870,don't see a king-size bed fitting in,ep068
873,here I don't see you know an area for,ep068
876,dressers I'm not sure about this size if,ep068
879,it's doable Wow okay we obviously have,ep068
882,the same vanity that was in the guest,ep068
885,bath it's gotten the same light as well,ep068
888,so basically those would need to get,ep068
891,changed out right now she needs to get,ep068
894,moved into a home and I think this,ep068
897,bathrooms beautiful and will work for,ep068
900,now and maybe she just needs to back off,ep068
903,the vintage a little bit and just take,ep068
906,that bathroom as it is,ep068
909,I love the hardwood floors and that,ep068
912,they're original they're absolutely,ep068
915,beautiful it's right across from the,ep068
918,park it's right next to you it is moving,ep068
921,ready and Ike which means I could close,ep068
924,escrow faster and just you know move in,ep068
927,but then also that leads into my,ep068
930,negative which is you know it is flipped,ep068
933,it is you know to somebody else's taste,ep068
936,and and everything's nice but you know,ep068
939,it's just it's not me,ep068
942,like I definitely need to have that,ep068
945,vintage Flair to my home and I much,ep068
948,rather have it be something that's,ep068
951,unique so now she's found another,ep068
954,mid-century home that she hopes will,ep068
957,have more vintage character it's still,ep068
960,in 1962 so era wise it's perfect it,ep068
963,could be perfect yeah,ep068
966,[Music],ep068
969,oh this one I kind of I was thinking,ep068
972,maybe for work it's really beautiful,ep068
975,silk forties I love it,ep068
978,Sarah loves all things vintage so she's,ep068
981,looking for a house in Chico California,ep068
984,that reflects her tastes I love a good,ep068
987,time yeah the time I do working with a,ep068
990,"$600,000 budget she and her friend Laura",ep068
993,have seen a 1940's bungalow that had,ep068
996,plenty of vintage features but it also,ep068
999,needed a lot of work then they saw a,ep068
1002,1960s ranch that was recently updated,ep068
1005,but some of the vintage character had,ep068
1008,been removed so now she's found another,ep068
1011,option in an area known as The Avenues I,ep068
1014,do like this neighborhood being in the,ep068
1017,ABS yeah I want you closer to me I know,ep068
1020,and you know it is the ranch and built,ep068
1023,in 1962 so era wise it's perfect,ep068
1026,it could be perfect yeah what's the,ep068
1029,price on it four hundred and ten,ep068
1032,thousand way under budget no I could do,ep068
1035,whatever I want and best thing has a,ep068
1038,pool will be awesome when you come right,ep068
1041,into the dining room which I'm a little,ep068
1044,concerned about this space it looks a,ep068
1047,little small to me what are you saying I,ep068
1050,don't know I don't think your tables,ep068
1053,gonna fit in the space I don't think it,ep068
1056,will either and I love to have lots of,ep068
1059,people over you know cook and have,ep068
1062,everybody sitting down at the table,ep068
1065,which is really nice but I do like that,ep068
1068,it opens up into the living room and the,ep068
1071,living room you know it's got I like the,ep068
1074,the brick wall with the fireplace,ep068
1077,definitely would have to redo the floors,ep068
1080,I am NOT a fan of carpet as you know,ep068
1083,size-wise I'm not quite sure if this is,ep068
1086,big enough I definitely like to have,ep068
1089,space where we can all hang out,ep068
1092,oh that's kitchens tight,ep068
1095,this is a little tight looks like,ep068
1098,potentially remodeled in the 90s,ep068
1101,not my favorite mm-hmm this definitely,ep068
1104,would need pretty much a total overhaul,ep068
1107,maybe I look into taking out this wall,ep068
1110,then this entire space could actually be,ep068
1113,pretty awesome,ep068
1116,so sir's on a tight schedule we need to,ep068
1119,find her something and get,ep068
1122,removed I think her doing a Renault it's,ep068
1125,just not really a good idea right now,ep068
1128,huh hmm well this is interesting it's,ep068
1131,I'm not sure if this is the master or is,ep068
1134,this just like an extra just sweet I do,ep068
1137,love how big the space is I definitely,ep068
1140,think the boys would probably fight over,ep068
1143,who got to take this as their room may,ep068
1146,see a full bathroom attached to this,ep068
1149,bedroom then go across the house to see,ep068
1152,another full bathroom two more bedrooms,ep068
1155,and the actual master actually a really,ep068
1158,good size mm-hmm,ep068
1161,I like this master so bright in here,ep068
1164,looks like another 90s remodel I would,ep068
1167,say the wood shower walls I know that I,ep068
1170,like being a a new one,ep068
1173,what I haven't seen before but then,ep068
1176,again you can still move into this and,ep068
1179,make it your own over time I think this,ep068
1182,bathroom I would have to actually do you,ep068
1185,really think I can handle that it's a,ep068
1188,little crazy let's go take a look at the,ep068
1191,pool and hopefully we just hang out at,ep068
1194,the pool the time anyways I do like the,ep068
1197,French doors beautiful yeah it's a pool,ep068
1200,it's a pool all right it is pretty much,ep068
1203,only a pool there's not really any,ep068
1206,grassy area for meatloaf to run around I,ep068
1209,like it I know you like it I know the,ep068
1212,boys will like it I do love this master,ep068
1215,I think the size on the light it's,ep068
1218,really pretty and right out to the pool,ep068
1221,so this area is awesome yeah the pool,ep068
1224,definitely is another positive I also I,ep068
1227,like the price on this one obviously,ep068
1230,under budget on negative side though you,ep068
1233,know there's a lot of projects that,ep068
1236,kitchen needs to be redone but for now,ep068
1239,it still has move-in ready you can move,ep068
1242,in and then just do those over time you,ep068
1245,know I don't want to do the money,ep068
1248,I'm kind of excited about you know,ep068
1251,getting to make the house exactly the,ep068
1254,way I want it I'm gonna really have to,ep068
1257,think about this one since she can't,ep068
1260,have everything she wants and she has,ep068
1263,limited time it may come down to how,ep068
1266,badly she wants vintage charm versus how,ep068
1269,much work she's really willing to do,ep068
1272,[Music],ep068
1275,again,ep068
1278,"sarah has a $600,000 budget for a house",ep068
1281,in Chico California it's big enough for,ep068
1284,herself and her two grown sons she and,ep068
1287,her friend Laura have seen several,ep068
1290,possibilities now she's ready to choose,ep068
1293,what about that 1940s bungalow near,ep068
1296,downtown for 260 thousand you do have,ep068
1299,room in the backyard for a pool it could,ep068
1302,be such a fun restoration project I can,ep068
1305,add on a huge master you know I could,ep068
1308,totally redo that kitchen,ep068
1311,it could be six seven months down the,ep068
1314,road before you ever get it to where you,ep068
1317,it's livable for you the 1960s Ranch,ep068
1320,right by the park,ep068
1323,"this place is priced at $499,000",ep068
1326,obviously that location is amazing right,ep068
1329,by you,ep068
1332,the yard is also beautiful super shaded,ep068
1335,yeah but there's no room for a pool in,ep068
1338,the backyard and then I would have to,ep068
1341,tear out brand-new fixtures and things,ep068
1344,that somebody just put in to make it be,ep068
1347,what I would want it to be but still,ep068
1350,it's move-in ready what do you think,ep068
1353,about the 1962 ranch in the avenues,ep068
1356,priced at 410 obviously it has your pool,ep068
1359,so you know that's one benefit to that,ep068
1362,house I do love all of the extra square,ep068
1365,footage as well as that master I think,ep068
1368,it was the best master we saw but the,ep068
1371,kitchen needs to be redone all the,ep068
1374,bathrooms need to be redone and at 410,ep068
1377,there,ep068
1380,so many options with that house so which,ep068
1383,one will she choose,ep068
1386,I love the 1960s ranch right by the park,ep068
1389,its location I mean that's like the best,ep068
1392,location pretty much in all of Chico and,ep068
1395,it's more move-in ready than the other,ep068
1398,places we looked at and you know I can,ep068
1401,add all of my little touches throughout,ep068
1404,so make it more my own I need to like go,ep068
1407,put in an offer ASAP let's do it right,ep068
1410,now let's do it,ep068
1413,go for a walk in the park I've been,ep068
1416,living in the house now for about three,ep068
1419,weeks this location is absolutely,ep068
1422,amazing you know I get home from work,ep068
1425,and take meat lifts off for a walk,ep068
1428,and then obviously there's always being,ep068
1431,able to walk to my girlfriend Lala's,ep068
1434,house who's only about you know five,ep068
1437,blocks away from me Sarah let's talk,ep068
1440,kitchen a little bit I bought a bunch of,ep068
1443,samples here for you to check out,ep068
1446,awesome I've been spending a lot of time,ep068
1449,with Christian my designer first,ep068
1452,backsplash I think we should get rid of,ep068
1455,the kind of short little splash you have,ep068
1458,there and then just do tile all the way,ep068
1461,up love it we are doing a new backsplash,ep068
1464,in the kitchen which I absolutely love,ep068
1467,do you want to do the sort of undulating,ep068
1470,wave or the more geometric what I,ep068
1473,absolutely love the wave I've never even,ep068
1476,seen a tile this shape or this size I,ep068
1479,left pretty much every piece of,ep068
1482,furniture that I have in the past and,ep068
1485,Kirsten and I are picking out absolutely,ep068
1488,everything I'm kind of thinking the,ep068
1491,crazy bug that would be super fun and,ep068
1494,people would be like what is that it's a,ep068
1497,conversation starter,ep068
1500,so far my absolute favorite part of the,ep068
1503,house would be the step-down room with,ep068
1506,the blue tiles I have told everybody,ep068
1509,that basically this is my pool and I,ep068
1512,know that some people might think you,ep068
1515,know I'm a little crazy for my wallpaper,ep068
1518,choices but every single time I walk in,ep068
1521,that front door and I look at the,ep068
1524,monkeys and the birds I get super happy,ep068
1527,I like to think that the style I'm going,ep068
1530,for is definitely like a bubbly sixties,ep068
1533,like cocktail party type of house it's,ep068
1536,set up for entertaining a lot of my,ep068
1539,friends,ep068
1542,[Music],ep068
1545,[Applause],ep068
1548,[Music],ep068
1551,you,ep068
12,a chance meeting in Auckland New Zealand,ep069
15,started a long-distance romance for Nate,ep069
18,and cat we had phone calls for hours at,ep069
21,a time really it was full cause day,ep069
24,after day,ep069
27,now she's relocating and after five,ep069
30,months of phone calls they're moving in,ep069
33,together we're going through this whole,ep069
36,moving process we're still getting to,ep069
39,know one another I think it's perfect we,ep069
42,don't need much more room than this it's,ep069
45,got to be a happy medium but I certainly,ep069
48,can't think of one right now they may be,ep069
51,in love but they're still strangers,ep069
54,obviously this is a dream for me the,ep069
57,apartment block idea I'm not so sure,ep069
60,"about she's come 11,000 miles there's a",ep069
63,yellow ball in this guy here that we,ep069
66,didn't seem to hover to find a home on,ep069
69,New Zealand sunny Coromandel Peninsula,ep069
72,[Music],ep069
75,[Applause],ep069
78,[Music],ep069
81,I'm so glad you made it I'm from just,ep069
84,outside Edinburgh and Scotland I came,ep069
87,over here to Auckland to see my friend,ep069
90,and she introduced both of us,ep069
93,Quezon I started chatting for a wee,ep069
96,while what phone numbers we didn't have,ep069
99,the opportunity to even have one date,ep069
102,we just knew but phone somebody really,ep069
105,special and went home the next day,ep069
108,and got a day went past who didn't speak,ep069
111,on board five months of that and then we,ep069
114,couldn't wait to be together again I'm,ep069
117,not so sure about living in the city I,ep069
120,know you have been talking about going,ep069
123,up and seeing the Coromandel we could go,ep069
126,and you could ever look around yeah to,ep069
129,me the Coromandel has always seemed more,ep069
132,as a holiday destination the job,ep069
135,situation I'm really unsure about I've,ep069
138,worked in timber flooring field in,ep069
141,Auckland for about 15 years I am,ep069
144,concerned for nico leaving auckland,ep069
147,because the practical side of things but,ep069
150,i think in the long run and in the short,ep069
153,term it's going to be great for a,ep069
156,relationship the Coromandel was just,ep069
159,amazing it's beautiful I've been going,ep069
162,there all my life as a child so growing,ep069
165,up around those beaches that actually,ep069
168,does feel like home get him back there,ep069
171,"11,000 miles from Scotland the",ep069
174,Coromandel Peninsula flips the seasons,ep069
177,for calves it's June the start of winter,ep069
180,and just two and a half hours away the,ep069
183,noise of New Zealand's largest city,ep069
186,disappears among mountains rainforests,ep069
189,miles of white-sand beaches and the town,ep069
192,of whitianga actually city anga the,ep069
195,Maori pronunciation just the names of,ep069
198,places in New Zealand it's just so,ep069
201,differently you have to really know how,ep069
204,to pronounce certain words and have to,ep069
207,get it right but besides that really,ep069
210,there isn't too many cultural shocks,ep069
213,here no just the sunshine there's a,ep069
216,yellow ball in the sky here that we,ep069
219,didn't seem to have in school,ep069
222,pitying is a holiday destination for,ep069
225,Kiwis and for people from all over the,ep069
228,world actually vidiians population is,ep069
231,"5,000 year-round and during the peak",ep069
234,"season about 30,000 people roll into",ep069
237,town so finding a rental for someone is,ep069
240,kind of a tall order especially if they,ep069
243,have a wish list a mile long ideally I,ep069
246,would love to have three bedrooms and,ep069
249,the rental property also I would love to,ep069
252,be in town so that walking distance to,ep069
255,the cafes and shops and just making the,ep069
258,most of beach life so preferably with a,ep069
261,lotion view,ep069
264,something with a bit of character would,ep069
267,be good I know Nate's wish list is a,ep069
270,little bit different to mine so I think,ep069
273,ideally I'd like to find somewhere rural,ep069
276,maybe 15 minutes out of town a little,ep069
279,bit of peace and quiet would be great,ep069
282,okay if we're gonna make the move from,ep069
285,the city I like to perhaps be somewhere,ep069
288,rural or most definitely in the bush a,ep069
291,sea view would be amazing but some of,ep069
294,the quiet peaceful how much are you guys,ep069
297,looking to spend thousand dollars alone,ep069
300,okay we might have to go a little bit,ep069
303,over the rentals that are available are,ep069
306,quite expensive because there's just not,ep069
309,a lot out there I would prefer to keep,ep069
312,it under budget that is close to town,ep069
315,and in the bush yes I've never quite had,ep069
318,anybody come in and want totally,ep069
321,opposite things before there's got to be,ep069
324,a happy medium but I certainly can't,ep069
327,think of one right now so Juliet goes to,ep069
330,the top of Nate's wish list house one is,ep069
333,a remote cottage in the bush 20 minutes,ep069
336,from town isn't it gorgeous about years,ep069
339,in fact woods everywhere this is in the,ep069
342,bush just like Nate wanted you have all,ep069
345,the privacy you could ever want this as,ep069
348,I really is this is a modern cottage,ep069
351,comes fully furnished it's completely,ep069
354,off grid your electricity independent,ep069
357,with solar panels will like that no,ep069
360,bills no bills and about 20 minutes from,ep069
363,town but the beauty of it is it's only,ep069
366,900 a month that is really good,ep069
369,oh well cozy fairly compact but I love,ep069
372,the furniture it's cute it's really cute,ep069
375,is it a living room this is kind of your,ep069
378,living and bedroom combo this is it well,ep069
381,you do have a nice kitchen over here all,ep069
384,the way over there what do you think,ep069
387,Nate I think it's perfect we don't need,ep069
390,much more room than this okay that's why,ep069
393,it's 900 a month when we decided to move,ep069
396,to the Coromandel this is exactly what I,ep069
399,had in mind somewhere secluded away from,ep069
402,people I think this is enough for us,ep069
405,this is ideal it'll be cozy but we still,ep069
408,have the issue of being out in the,ep069
411,middle of nowhere but we'll address this,ep069
414,if I can live remotely like this I,ep069
417,really don't know let's have a look at,ep069
420,the kitchen,ep069
423,okay oh wow,ep069
426,just view nice view of the bush out the,ep069
429,window while you're cooking yeah you,ep069
432,have a gas hob a nice new fridge who,ep069
435,hopes tiny fridge perfect for adult oh,ep069
438,the kitchen is tiny it really was quite,ep069
441,overwhelming how small that was I was,ep069
444,looking for something quite a bit bigger,ep069
447,than that we'd only struggle if we had,ep069
450,guests but most of the time it will just,ep069
453,be us great let's have a look at the,ep069
456,restroom okay excellent it's nice and,ep069
459,light but there's no bath it is very,ep069
462,modern but unfortunately there's not,ep069
465,room for a bath should shower though so,ep069
468,that's a bonus what do you think I think,ep069
471,it's still I do I don't see anything,ep069
474,wrong so that there's plenty of space in,ep069
477,here you prefer your shower but I'm just,ep069
480,a bit disappointed there's no bath I,ep069
483,love the place the size of the house may,ep069
486,be a little small but to me it's all,ep069
489,about the outside I'm not exactly sure,ep069
492,cares as sold on the idea of living out,ep069
495,this far away from town I think she's,ep069
498,already got her mind set on what she's,ep069
501,exactly looking for right guys this is,ep069
504,one of the best features of the property,ep069
507,you have your own private stream the,ep069
510,water is so clean you could drink it,ep069
513,doesn't expect to find this at the,ep069
516,bottom of the garden I'm really excited,ep069
519,it's amazing beautiful what did you guys,ep069
522,think of the house,ep069
525,it's exactly what I want somewhere right,ep069
528,out of civilisation self-maintained,ep069
531,quiet cozy but that's all we need I,ep069
534,really like it no bells is a major bonus,ep069
537,the location still an issue for me but,ep069
540,we'll see definitely worth considering,ep069
543,obviously this is a dream for me perfect,ep069
546,location gorgeous apartment the,ep069
549,apartment block idea I'm not so sure,ep069
552,about to find everything they want is,ep069
555,going to be virtually impossible oh gosh,ep069
558,as cold excited it to be warmer than,ep069
561,Scott,ep069
564,after one brief introduction and five,ep069
567,months getting to know each other by,ep069
570,phone I managed to finally convince it,ep069
573,to move to be with me has left home and,ep069
576,family in Scotland for Auckland New,ep069
579,Zealand making the journey itself was,ep069
582,just nerve-wracking but was so worth it,ep069
585,because we just have been desperate to,ep069
588,see each other for so many months it's,ep069
591,so quiet I can see the fish jumping this,ep069
594,is perfect they soon decided to hunt for,ep069
597,a new home in the Coromandel Peninsula,ep069
600,near the town of vidi anga away from,ep069
603,city life and just concentrate on each,ep069
606,other rather than having this whole,ep069
609,whirlwind of a massive city floating,ep069
612,around us as well this new idea but,ep069
615,while they both want a quiet life near,ep069
618,the Coromandel is calm sunny coast there,ep069
621,is a risk I've been working in the same,ep069
624,industry now for about 15 years giving,ep069
627,all that up and moving to a town where,ep069
630,there is no job there is a huge risk and,ep069
633,real confusion about the home they hope,ep069
636,to find I know Nate's wish list is a,ep069
639,little bit different to mine well the,ep069
642,wish list Nate wants to be out of town,ep069
645,in a little batch off the grid kad's,ep069
648,wants to be in town in a modern new,ep069
651,place where she can walk everywhere so,ep069
654,we've got completely different needs,ep069
657,house one is certainly rural this sure,ep069
660,doesn't expect to find us at the bottom,ep069
663,of the garden give your own private,ep069
666,stream I'm it excited it's amazing,ep069
669,beautiful and it's priced below budget,ep069
672,it's only 900 a month that is really,ep069
675,good but while its remote location is at,ep069
678,the top of Nate's wish list I like to,ep069
681,perhaps be somewhere in the bush to,ep069
684,Hobbs tiny fridge perfect for a doll so,ep069
687,it's far away from the lifestyle caz,ep069
690,once the further we go into the jungle,ep069
693,the more I was thinking absolutely no,ep069
696,way whatsoever I love the place the size,ep069
699,of the house may be a little small but,ep069
702,to me it's all about the outside in the,ep069
705,river look at those gorgeous houses with,ep069
708,the beautiful view this is absolutely,ep069
711,idyllic I really would love to be in,ep069
714,town that would be excellent to be,ep069
717,around some life being able to walk to,ep069
720,the shops and the cafes and restaurants,ep069
723,Juliette brings the hand out of the bush,ep069
726,to an apartment close to town but how,ep069
729,- lacks the rural character Nate wants,ep069
732,my strategy for picking this house was I,ep069
735,wanted something a bit different than,ep069
738,the country house I wanted to show them,ep069
741,something that was a bit more roomy and,ep069
744,to have good views of the water it's a,ep069
747,3-bedroom 2bath apartment then you're,ep069
750,extremely close to the water this was,ep069
753,beautiful being right across the road,ep069
756,from the beach how much is this it's,ep069
759,"1,100 a month it's a little over budget",ep069
762,and it does remind me being back in the,ep069
765,city again as well so yeah I'm not,ep069
768,really so sure really yeah but let's,ep069
771,have a look inside this is amazing looks,ep069
774,like time to compromise okay,ep069
777,you have a really nice big living room,ep069
780,area a huge deck that overlooks the,ep069
783,water that's absolutely beautiful the,ep069
786,view is to die for,ep069
789,all the furnishings come with this so,ep069
792,you're set ready turnkey move in I,ep069
795,absolutely love this property I think,ep069
798,Julia it's got its spot on here with,ep069
801,regards to the apartment itself its,ep069
804,location and the view we have a really,ep069
807,nice modern kitchen a lot of storage,ep069
810,good space I like the modern facilities,ep069
813,and I like the space but I still can't,ep069
816,help feel like I'm a little but,ep069
819,condensed here it still feels like the,ep069
822,city to me I'm not sure I think once,ep069
825,you're in and settled in imagine cooking,ep069
828,here with that stunning view across the,ep069
831,water I watching the BOTS I do like the,ep069
834,view I would feel really bad if for me,ep069
837,it had to give up his dream of living,ep069
840,really to move to the apartment however,ep069
843,I kinda have moved across the other,ep069
846,sides of the world so I think we've both,ep069
849,had a bit of give and take here oh gosh,ep069
852,look at that view again so here's your,ep069
855,master bedroom great closet space,ep069
858,imagine just waking it up to that view,ep069
861,every single morning watching the boats,ep069
864,come in and the boardroom as well that's,ep069
867,a fantastic bonus it's huge,ep069
870,I'm about 50/50 on the apartment it's,ep069
873,just the location that's a bit of a,ep069
876,downer for me I'm really struggling to,ep069
879,see past that here's big baths for me,ep069
882,excellent live show her for me lovely,ep069
885,new appliances oh yes I love this,ep069
888,bedroom - sunny the second bedroom is,ep069
891,nice and bright it's got great storage,ep069
894,in the closet you have access to the,ep069
897,deck from this room and parents can come,ep069
900,and stay and they would love this place,ep069
903,I like it but it's still over budget and,ep069
906,besides that it's the location I felt,ep069
909,the location was still too central too,ep069
912,much in town I like a little bit more,ep069
915,space I did feel that Nate would,ep069
918,have that feeling of it being too,ep069
921,central to town but that's exactly what,ep069
924,I'm looking for so it's very difficult,ep069
927,to compromise,ep069
930,well it's decent-sized a great spot for,ep069
933,the Barbie and a few beers so what do,ep069
936,you guys think obviously this is a dream,ep069
939,for me perfect location gorgeous,ep069
942,apartment we still have the issue of the,ep069
945,budget being slightly over I do like the,ep069
948,size of the place and the fact that it's,ep069
951,so maintenance but it still feels a,ep069
954,little bit too much like it's in town,ep069
957,for me and the apartment block idea I'm,ep069
960,not so sure about the hunt goes farther,ep069
963,from town still not in the bush but the,ep069
966,location surprises them both well the,ep069
969,love Springs that was gonna be nice and,ep069
972,warm caseinate have come to the,ep069
975,coromandel peninsula to find a home away,ep069
978,from city life how cool is this like a,ep069
981,tropical islands is amazing 9 miles of,ep069
984,beaches rugged hilly rainforests and,ep069
987,natural warm pools left from ancient,ep069
990,volcanoes are far removed from city life,ep069
993,in Auckland or the UK well you know I,ep069
996,love the city but you know we don't have,ep069
999,studies at home in Scotland and I kinda,ep069
1002,was hoping for know that I'm here beachy,ep069
1005,traditional TV kick back relax they're,ep069
1008,looking for a home to rent on a budget,ep069
1011,"of $1,000 a month Nate wants something",ep069
1014,rustic out in the bush secluded,ep069
1017,somewhere rural a little bit of peace,ep069
1020,and quiet would be great while Cass,ep069
1023,wants something close to shops and,ep069
1026,restaurants I would much prefer to see,ep069
1029,civilization from a window not be so,ep069
1032,isolated real estate agent Juliette,ep069
1035,Myles began the hunt with a remote,ep069
1038,property favoring Nate's priorities it's,ep069
1041,completely off grid well like this this,ep069
1044,is kind of your living and bedroom combo,ep069
1047,it really was quite overwhelming how,ep069
1050,small it was but not for Nate it's,ep069
1053,exactly what I want house 2 is more,ep069
1056,spacious but it's in a busy location,ep069
1059,close to town this is amazing,ep069
1062,I like the modern facilities and I like,ep069
1065,the space but it still feels like the,ep069
1068,city to me how do you feel now about,ep069
1071,leaving the city I'm really pleased I,ep069
1074,live the city actually,ep069
1077,at least not happy with house 3 Juliet,ep069
1080,brings the house hunt farther from town,ep069
1083,I really thought that it would help Nate,ep069
1086,feel a little bit more private beach is,ep069
1089,always empty here beautiful this 3,ep069
1092,bedrooms 2 baths you can step out the,ep069
1095,door and put your toes in the sand I can,ep069
1098,hear the ocean from here so I'm guessing,ep069
1101,"this is well over budget it's 1,500 a",ep069
1104,month it's quite a bit over the budget,ep069
1107,actually but a lot the location though,ep069
1110,the locations are no brainer it's,ep069
1113,absolutely fantastic but two points it's,ep069
1116,still not in town for me and also with,ep069
1119,it being over budget it just puts a,ep069
1122,little bit extra pressure on a,ep069
1125,relationship so that's still a huge,ep069
1128,consideration for us for me it's a,ep069
1131,little bit retro inside but the,ep069
1134,locations fantastic so yeah I'm,ep069
1137,definitely pretty Keens just the budget,ep069
1140,that is the main issue here I like a,ep069
1143,little bit of character in the house,ep069
1146,location is just unbelievably fantastic,ep069
1149,and then you need wood like that too,ep069
1152,although perhaps a little bit quiet I,ep069
1155,was really hoping for caffee's to walk,ep069
1158,to restaurants the buzz of people going,ep069
1161,past and the tone location although it's,ep069
1164,only a five-minute drive from town I'll,ep069
1167,be having the vehicle for work so that,ep069
1170,makes it at least a half hour walk for,ep069
1173,her so it's not ideal in that respect ok,ep069
1176,guys the kitchen has everything you,ep069
1179,could need you've got a nice stove,ep069
1182,dishwasher microwave you've got views,ep069
1185,out every direction can you imagine,ep069
1188,having dinner and sitting and watching,ep069
1191,the ocean every night oh definitely time,ep069
1194,I feel the appliances are a little dated,ep069
1197,and stove tops electric so that's gonna,ep069
1200,add more to the cost certainly can't,ep069
1203,deny the views out the window yeah oh,ep069
1206,this is a sweet bedroom nice little bit,ep069
1209,this is considered your master bedroom,ep069
1212,you do have an ensuite here oh that's a,ep069
1215,great bonus I didn't expect that,ep069
1218,yeah and it's a little bit tight but you,ep069
1221,have high ceilings and exposed beams,ep069
1224,makes it feel a bit bigger yeah and,ep069
1227,great views everywhere you look again,ep069
1230,absolutely oh yeah this is sweet,ep069
1233,you have an identical bathroom,ep069
1236,downstairs so you have two baths that's,ep069
1239,pretty much all we need except for a,ep069
1242,bath,ep069
1245,qez are still very new to new zealand,ep069
1248,and living on the beach and having the,ep069
1251,beach experience is important but I,ep069
1254,think equally so being surrounded by,ep069
1257,civilization so she doesn't quite feel,ep069
1260,so secluded at the end of the day cares,ep069
1263,is happiness is most important here this,ep069
1266,is a great-sized room this is a great,ep069
1269,room for you to have guests it's the,ep069
1272,second bedroom there's also a third,ep069
1275,single bedroom if you need even more,ep069
1278,room for guests that will be excellent,ep069
1281,for when mom and dads come over to stay,ep069
1284,in there's a larger room than the master,ep069
1287,so yeah they have plenty room that's,ep069
1290,good to have that extra space for family,ep069
1293,and friends to come and stay as well and,ep069
1296,they're gonna want to and it's this,ep069
1299,close to the beach oh my god look at,ep069
1302,this this is executive pretty,ep069
1305,spectacular I'm loving the location the,ep069
1308,beach house still feels just a little,ep069
1311,bit dated inside but it's functional and,ep069
1314,it's got everything that we need and you,ep069
1317,certainly can't beat this that's exactly,ep069
1320,what we dreamed of this beach in itself,ep069
1323,is just out of this world so it's really,ep069
1326,easy to get carried away with the,ep069
1329,excitement of paradise but it's,ep069
1332,considerably over budget so we still,ep069
1335,have some thinking to do it's a little,ep069
1338,over budget well quite a bit over budget,ep069
1341,but I still can't rule it out I'm just,ep069
1344,loving where it is of slightly out of,ep069
1347,town,ep069
1350,okay well let's have a think about it,ep069
1353,Juliette's had a really tough job from,ep069
1356,the start trying to find something,ep069
1359,closest to town rustic modern,ep069
1362,low-maintenance is definitely gonna be,ep069
1365,allowed to compromise in the middle,ep069
1368,there somewhere they're hunting for a,ep069
1371,home on the Coromandel Peninsula with,ep069
1374,very different wishes I thought the,ep069
1377,location was perfect,ep069
1380,I couldn't think of anything worse,ep069
1383,[Music],ep069
1386,from the moment they first met Kazon 8,ep069
1389,knew they were right for each other we,ep069
1392,just kept on staying in touch for phone,ep069
1395,calls,ep069
1398,hours of phone calls then built the,ep069
1401,relationship very slowly that way for,ep069
1404,about five months it was a bit of an,ep069
1407,old-fashioned romance really now just,ep069
1410,months into a brand-new relationship,ep069
1413,Kaz and Nate have decided to hunt for a,ep069
1416,home away from the big city I know you,ep069
1419,have been talking about going up and,ep069
1422,seeing the Coromandel we could go off,ep069
1425,and you could ever look around yeah so,ep069
1428,their hunt began with a remote cottage,ep069
1431,on the Coromandel Peninsula 20 minutes,ep069
1434,from the town of fiddy anga I really,ep069
1437,liked the location of the place out in,ep069
1440,the bush I know it's a little small,ep069
1443,but it's also under budget it was way,ep069
1446,too small family and friends can't come,ep069
1449,to stay and personally it was way too,ep069
1452,far out in the bush for me so Julia,ep069
1455,brought the hunt closer to town with,ep069
1458,house 2 there that one was really,ep069
1461,special,ep069
1464,we had the extra bedroom I felt fine,ep069
1467,about the budget it just wasn't too sure,ep069
1470,about where it was situated it just,ep069
1473,still felt a little silly like being an,ep069
1476,apartment but nice appliances,ep069
1479,heddle the space that we needed each,ep069
1482,front house 3 cotton eights I absolutely,ep069
1485,love the location of the third place,ep069
1488,right on the water,ep069
1491,two bathrooms one ensuite but it was,ep069
1494,hugely over-budget but I still can't see,ep069
1497,past where it's located the tough choice,ep069
1500,yeah absolutely,ep069
1503,what's the thinking to do,ep069
1506,[Music],ep069
1509,well I think we really need to make a,ep069
1512,decision here and perhaps scratch one,ep069
1515,off the list what do you think I would,ep069
1518,love to take the country cottage off the,ep069
1521,list,ep069
1524,really I thought the location was,ep069
1527,perfect it's perfect for you moose,ep069
1530,hunting the rivers right there,ep069
1533,no neighbors around I really wanted to,ep069
1536,get that vibe and move out of the city,ep069
1539,and just forget about you know people,ep069
1542,it's just too far I'm afraid Plus yeah,ep069
1545,I'd be a little bit concerned with,ep069
1548,getting home late at night and you're,ep069
1551,stuck out there so that's not ideal,ep069
1554,that's definitely off the less than I,ep069
1557,think so,ep069
1560,the beach house or the town apartment,ep069
1563,well I really love the beach house it's,ep069
1566,the location is exactly where I wanted,ep069
1569,to be you know when we talked about,ep069
1572,leaving the city it was either the bush,ep069
1575,or the beach the beach house was a,ep069
1578,little bit dated insides but I think,ep069
1581,that's part and parcel of the whole,ep069
1584,beach house experience I want to be,ep069
1587,close to the water if I can't have the,ep069
1590,bush then that's what I'm gonna go for,ep069
1593,but I definitely loved the town,ep069
1596,apartment I think you would get over the,ep069
1599,fact that it's in town you're still,ep069
1602,thinking City but it's not we're in a,ep069
1605,very small town though yes it is in the,ep069
1608,tone but it had everything we were,ep069
1611,looking for that was a clear winner for,ep069
1614,me the beach house was largest but it,ep069
1617,was hugely over her budget,ep069
1620,"the price was $1,500 a month yeah I",ep069
1623,guess the price is a bit of a factor I,ep069
1626,mean we don't exactly know what we're,ep069
1629,going to be doing for work just yet and,ep069
1632,it'll pretty much tap through the,ep069
1635,savings quite fast so tell me what,ep069
1638,you're thinking,ep069
1641,well the toun apartment has a view of,ep069
1644,the beach so I'm hoping that would,ep069
1647,contribute towards you potentially being,ep069
1650,sweet towards its own apartment so it,ep069
1653,sounds like we're starting to come,ep069
1656,towards a decision here you've reached a,ep069
1659,decision well I guess if that's what's,ep069
1662,gonna make you happy,ep069
1665,there is the room it is modern and clean,ep069
1668,so the best what you want then yeah,ep069
1671,let's do it,ep069
1674,does that mean we've reached a decision,ep069
1677,[Laughter],ep069
1680,time to chill I've certainly found the,ep069
1683,piece that we were aiming to achieve by,ep069
1686,leaving the city and moving out to the,ep069
1689,Coromandel area it's just fantastic the,ep069
1692,beach life has been so relaxing so,ep069
1695,peaceful it really has been a fantastic,ep069
1698,decision we're so happy I found a house,ep069
1701,boarding job here and free anger it's,ep069
1704,being positive the move I've got the,ep069
1707,pictures for that property the job that,ep069
1710,I found that the real estate office is,ep069
1713,the same office that Juliette worked,ep069
1716,seven so yes we've been pretty,ep069
1719,inseparable holiday I make the promise,ep069
1722,to you so we've disorder to get married,ep069
1725,just to add the flesh at all we make us,ep069
1728,your beautiful bride mate well the,ep069
1731,wedding day was very short notice so,ep069
1734,unfortunately friends and family,ep069
1737,couldn't join from Scotland although,ep069
1740,they'll be there in the heart so I'm,ep069
1743,sure is this like a little dream come,ep069
1746,true I just can't wait to kick back and,ep069
1749,enjoy married life we never do what I,ep069
1752,want when I want,ep069

81,boutique law firm maybe we can do the,ep070
84,final bit together the 101 okay so I was,ep070
87,born and North Oxford in England but I,ep070
90,grew up partly in Toronto and eventually,ep070
93,made my way through a long and winding,ep070
96,road to Chicago Illinois and I was born,ep070
99,in Miami Florida after college she moved,ep070
102,to Chicago for work and it was there she,ep070
105,met dunstan Dunson and I actually met on,ep070
108,one of those dating apps I happened to,ep070
111,swipe right and so did he we initially,ep070
114,went out just for drinks and before you,ep070
117,know it we were out for two or three,ep070
120,hours and went on to another bar so,ep070
123,great first day except that she told me,ep070
126,she believed in mermaids so I wasn't,ep070
129,really sure whether to go on a second,ep070
132,date I mean mermaids are real so she,ep070
135,would I mean hmm she said her brother,ep070
138,wedding definitely Nicole and I got,ep070
141,engaged about six months ago I was at a,ep070
144,conference in Italy for work,ep070
147,he brought Nicole along on the trip but,ep070
150,she had no idea he was planning to,ep070
153,propose I took her walking out to a park,ep070
156,she didn't notice the guy with two giant,ep070
159,cameras he was you know hiding behind,ep070
162,the grassy knoll he actually got on one,ep070
165,knee and I was completely shocked so it,ep070
168,was really really exciting do you want,ep070
171,to have the Italian photographer come,ep070
174,out from Milan and shoot our wedding,ep070
177,good see we could reach out so so we've,ep070
180,been renting a townhome together for,ep070
183,about the past two years and we thought,ep070
186,instead of getting married this year why,ep070
189,don't we put the wedding off for a year,ep070
192,and we'll find a house together in the,ep070
195,"meantime our budget is 500,000",ep070
198,so they have space for guests while,ep070
201,dunstan is willing to consider a condo,ep070
204,Nicole wants a single-family home in one,ep070
207,of the up-and-coming neighborhoods on,ep070
210,Chicago's South Side the prices are a,ep070
213,little bit more reasonable on the south,ep070
216,side,ep070
219,not many people know but many of the,ep070
222,neighborhoods in the southside of,ep070
225,Chicago were in the past the center of,ep070
228,the city that's why there's so many,ep070
231,beautiful historical homes Jackson Park,ep070
234,hosted the World's Fair Dunstan's open,ep070
237,to that area as long as he can still,ep070
240,bike to work our current rental is in a,ep070
243,great location in terms of proximity to,ep070
246,work I'm able to cyclins work within,ep070
249,about 20 minutes so I'd really be,ep070
252,looking for a place where I can still,ep070
255,cycle into work within about half an,ep070
258,hour here's my style look at this modern,ep070
261,construction mmm it's a little bland,ep070
264,when it comes to architecture all style,ep070
267,Dustin and I definitely see things,ep070
270,differently,ep070
273,I prefer vintage homes row homes I think,ep070
276,are amazing you know wood-burning,ep070
279,fireplaces one of the things I,ep070
282,definitely love about vintage homes are,ep070
285,the defined spaces I mean they're,ep070
288,sometimes pocket doors that separate the,ep070
291,poorer the dining room from the kitchen,ep070
294,with modern day living it just makes,ep070
297,more sense to have open spaces growing,ep070
300,up in England it's not unusual to see,ep070
303,homes that they're centuries-old I'm,ep070
306,ready for something new something,ep070
309,contemporary I don't like the white,ep070
312,appliances at all because modern in the,ep070
315,80s I think they could be updated,ep070
318,speaking of update he's looking forward,ep070
321,to a project she wants her vintage,ep070
324,charmer to be totally move-in ready so,ep070
327,she's looking for a home that's been,ep070
330,authentically restored and not stripped,ep070
333,of its character one of the reasons I,ep070
336,don't like to find spaces that you find,ep070
339,in some vintage homes is that I'm the,ep070
342,one stuck in the kitchen cooking while,ep070
345,the coals out in the front room,ep070
348,entertaining my current kitchen is quite,ep070
351,cramped which makes it very hard to use,ep070
354,there's also not a lot of room for all,ep070
357,the accessories that one uses when one,ep070
360,is preparing a meal you gotta appreciate,ep070
363,this closet at least yeah it's a,ep070
366,beautiful closet Nicole wants an ensuite,ep070
369,master with a large enough walk-in,ep070
372,closet to accommodate all of her shoes,ep070
375,my shoe palace right now my shoes,ep070
378,literally spill out of the closet into,ep070
381,our master bedroom oh I really like this,ep070
384,clawfoot tub you know a stand-up shower,ep070
387,would be more convenient one thing I,ep070
390,like about our current unit is we've got,ep070
393,a shower that's big enough for two not,ep070
396,something I'd be looking for in our new,ep070
399,home they'd also love an outdoor space,ep070
402,for their dog Henri and there's one more,ep070
405,thing,ep070
408,[Music],ep070
411,ideally in our new place we'd find,ep070
414,something similar to the current set up,ep070
417,where we have you know separate spaces,ep070
420,so that I can play music without having,ep070
423,to listen to Nicole's reality-tv where I,ep070
426,don't have to hear him tuning his guitar,ep070
429,strumming while I'm enjoying those,ep070
432,lovely TV shows that he's mentioning,ep070
435,first up they're seeing a brownstone on,ep070
438,the south side,ep070
441,today we're in Bronzeville we're in a,ep070
444,older historic community in the south,ep070
447,side of Chicago it was built in 1885 Wow,ep070
450,what do you think of the facade oh I'm,ep070
453,in love what I love the stonework the,ep070
456,red stones beautiful so a little rugged,ep070
459,isn't it definitely tell it was built in,ep070
462,1885 which looks like it's been - yeah,ep070
465,and it's about a 45-minute bike ride -,ep070
468,Dunstan's office,ep070
471,I think Nicole is really keen on this,ep070
474,neighborhood I'm still a bit concerned,ep070
477,that we're a little too far out I'd,ep070
480,rather be a little bit closer to the,ep070
483,pulse of the city so I can hop on my,ep070
486,bike and get to work okay so this home,ep070
489,is listed for three hundred sixteen,ep070
492,thousand four bedrooms and two full,ep070
495,bathrooms Wow 368 that's well below our,ep070
498,budget yeah I wonder if it's such a,ep070
501,great price well it doesn't need a lot,ep070
504,of work well let's go check it out and,ep070
507,you'll see okay perfect oh wow this,ep070
510,place is beautiful it's a functioning,ep070
513,wood-burning fireplace but the mantel,ep070
516,and the tile were added late 20th,ep070
519,century I'd say we could take this,ep070
522,fireplace out and put in a nice modern,ep070
525,gas burning fireplace it's a,ep070
528,wood-burning fireplace I really want to,ep070
531,keep that feature what is original are,ep070
534,these floors oh wow it's inlay pattern,ep070
537,wow that's gorgeous,ep070
540,the banister the good thing about this,ep070
543,property is that their original,ep070
546,banisters are still there the fireplace,ep070
549,is still there it still has the heart,ep070
552,and character of the home one of the,ep070
555,things that is kind of sad about these,ep070
558,vintage homes and some of the ones that,ep070
561,we've seen is that they go in and they,ep070
564,take away all those details and that,ep070
567,charm told them that so that is a,ep070
570,support column it's load-bearing they,ep070
573,see a formal dining room and a,ep070
576,first-floor bath this kitchen is just so,ep070
579,dark and not original well you wanted an,ep070
582,old vintage house you're probably gonna,ep070
585,get a dark kitchen where they cook is,ep070
588,slaving away in the back but if we're,ep070
591,talking about you know ripping out,ep070
594,cabinets and getting new appliances and,ep070
597,remodel the entire kitchen that can take,ep070
600,a lot of time and money,ep070
603,I think Nicole is trying to get both a,ep070
606,vintage charm and mu,ep070
609,ready and those are two beasts that,ep070
612,don't always follow the same master if,ep070
615,you will she's gonna have to take on a,ep070
618,few of these projects if she wants to,ep070
621,get her vintage charming house off the,ep070
624,kitchen is the outdoor space and not,ep070
627,much of a backyard there's space to,ep070
630,entertain nor space for Henry back,ep070
633,inside they head up to the second level,ep070
636,on the upper floor here you'll find all,ep070
639,four bedrooms as well as one bathroom,ep070
642,back in the 19th century all the bedding,ep070
645,shared a bathroom okay really a double,ep070
648,shower yeah I don't think it's gonna be,ep070
651,what you envisioned no yeah we play,ep070
654,y'all won't fit in there yeah so try it,ep070
657,so here is the the back bedroom this,ep070
660,could be your music room okay what's,ep070
663,this uh people and this is where the,ep070
666,home originally ended and this was,ep070
669,probably a window okay that's a little,ep070
672,strange thing to keep in in the middle,ep070
675,of a house this is yet another bedroom,ep070
678,however because there is no master,ep070
681,bathroom you could convert this into one,ep070
684,you have enough space for a large shower,ep070
687,okay,ep070
690,next door is the master bedrooms it's a,ep070
693,decent amount of space I like the,ep070
696,fireplace here which is somewhat,ep070
699,original yeah this original I believe,ep070
702,it's just been painted over and not sure,ep070
705,if you noticed but there is no closet in,ep070
708,this room again it was a feature that,ep070
711,they didn't really think about back in,ep070
714,the late 19th century the closets,ep070
717,located outside of the bedroom I mean,ep070
720,you can fit all your shoes in that yeah,ep070
723,nothing else,ep070
726,[Music],ep070
729,make the house the way we want it so,ep070
732,that's a good thing yeah definitely I,ep070
735,mean it has all the vintage character,ep070
738,and charm that I like but there's really,ep070
741,a lot of projects I think it would be,ep070
744,worth the investment to improve certain,ep070
747,things in the house at the kitchen and,ep070
750,upgrade the bathrooms at a big closet,ep070
753,and this neighborhood is really growing,ep070
756,in value it's transitioning and I think,ep070
759,you'd be ahead of the boom if you bought,ep070
762,it now these Chicago row homes there's a,ep070
765,certain charm to them but at the same,ep070
768,time I'm secretly hoping that we can,ep070
771,find somewhere this contemporary that,ep070
774,would suit my style so now their brokers,ep070
777,showing them something more contemporary,ep070
780,for dunston but how much is it listed,ep070
783,for 529 whoa that's way over our budget,ep070
786,[Music],ep070
789,oh great Chicago couple Nicole and,ep070
792,"Dunstan have a budget of $500,000 to buy",ep070
795,their first home before they tie the,ep070
798,knot so far they've seen an under budget,ep070
801,row home with vintage details for Nicole,ep070
804,but it had none of the contemporary vibe,ep070
807,Dunston is looking for so their broker,ep070
810,is lined up a place that needs no,ep070
813,renovation and is more to Dunstan's,ep070
816,taste plus it's only a 30-minute bike,ep070
819,ride to his office all right today we,ep070
822,are in Logie square it's very hip,ep070
825,neighborhood not too far from where you,ep070
828,currently live oh it's good I can,ep070
831,probably still bike to work yeah that,ep070
834,same commute time yeah but we're on one,ep070
837,of the busiest streets in Logan Square,ep070
840,there's a major street but I mean that's,ep070
843,just part of city life is this it this,ep070
846,is it it's brand-new construction never,ep070
849,before lived in so I think Dunston,ep070
852,you'll appreciate the fact that it's,ep070
855,very modern in contemporary and it's the,ep070
858,top two floors of this building to be,ep070
861,penthouse unit oh wow that sounds really,ep070
864,nice it's not much to it in terms of,ep070
867,look and feel well it's a sort of modern,ep070
870,look yeah so how much is it listed for,ep070
873,okay so keep in mind it's a three bed,ep070
876,two and a half bath duplex up 10th house,ep070
879,unit for 529 whoa that's way over our,ep070
882,budget okay keep it up in mind,ep070
885,okay come on in I like the hardwood,ep070
888,floors oh yeah it's nice and big and,ep070
891,open oh wow look at this kitchen yeah,ep070
894,very modern right you say that like it's,ep070
897,a bad thing but look at all these new,ep070
900,appliances you got double freezer here,ep070
903,nice new of them yeah but I don't think,ep070
906,I'm a fan of these cabinets at all,ep070
909,there's no defined space for the dining,ep070
912,room table and and just entertaining I,ep070
915,mean do we want the TV to be five feet,ep070
918,away from the sofa,ep070
921,Nicole's really hesitant to live,ep070
924,somewhere that doesn't have defined,ep070
927,spaces but I think we've got enough room,ep070
930,here where we can set up a dining room,ep070
933,space living room space and they'll be,ep070
936,great for entertaining you know you have,ep070
939,everyone in one room together,ep070
942,is this a gas fireplace,ep070
945,that is gas fireplace yes very,ep070
948,contemporary yeah I'm not a fan of it,ep070
951,there's not even a mantel when you walk,ep070
954,into a contemporary space like this I,ep070
957,feel like it's lacking character lacking,ep070
960,a bit of history lacking a bit of soul,ep070
963,to be honest oh it's a little loud out,ep070
966,here yeah it's a little noisy but I mean,ep070
969,it's a nice big balcony yeah it's a lot,ep070
972,of space I guess they head back inside,ep070
975,so on the upper floors where you find,ep070
978,all three bedrooms and the two full,ep070
981,bathrooms,ep070
984,there's the smallest bedroom you can use,ep070
987,it as your music room Boston it's tiny I,ep070
990,don't know it will work the music room,ep070
993,might be even too small for that and you,ep070
996,got your guest bathroom and you're just,ep070
999,bedroom okay oh it's nice that the,ep070
1002,guests will have access to the patio and,ep070
1005,then lastly we have the master bedroom,ep070
1008,so bit on the smaller side I've gotta,ep070
1011,say you got a nice ceiling height and,ep070
1014,you have an attached private deck you,ep070
1017,know that is nice it's nice and bright,ep070
1020,at least in the house expose your,ep070
1023,walkthrough closet area got your kids in,ep070
1026,first side oh these are really nice,ep070
1029,mm-hmm and you can configure it to make,ep070
1032,it your fu palace Nicole then the,ep070
1035,bathroom yeah check out the shower size,ep070
1038,for yourself there you go nice big,ep070
1041,shower,ep070
1044,is it enough room for two people yeah I,ep070
1047,think so you want to try it out sure the,ep070
1050,shower looks like a phone I think it's,ep070
1053,for you oh hello,ep070
1056,it's brand-new so there are no projects,ep070
1059,to tackle and so I'm not a fan of the,ep070
1062,undefined space and in general this,ep070
1065,place lacks character it's a little,ep070
1068,sterile well I'll just call this amazing,ep070
1071,kitchen right here it's nice modern new,ep070
1074,so it's got this open floor plan it is,ep070
1077,way above our budget,ep070
1080,yeah that's a lot to think about let's,ep070
1083,keep looking so their brokers showing,ep070
1086,them something more affordable there's a,ep070
1089,trade-off it's a fourth bad green half,ep070
1092,bath row home we step 425 it sounds like,ep070
1095,it might be a little far to cycle,ep070
1098,they're keeping busy engage Chicago,ep070
1101,professionals Dunstan in a cold want to,ep070
1104,"buy a home within their $500,000 budget",ep070
1107,they've already seen a vintage Rojo,ep070
1110,Nicole's style with a low price tag but,ep070
1113,it needed renovation Nicole doesn't want,ep070
1116,to do they've also seen a new,ep070
1119,construction home that was move-in ready,ep070
1122,and Dunstan's preferred contemporary,ep070
1125,style but it was over budget so now,ep070
1128,their brokers brought them back to,ep070
1131,Bronzeville to see another option it's a,ep070
1134,nice blending of the old vintage that I,ep070
1137,think Nicole you will enjoy while it's,ep070
1140,been fully rehab on the inside so I,ep070
1143,think that will appeal to you Dustin,ep070
1146,well it does but where's my project,ep070
1149,gonna be,ep070
1152,well it won't be at this place to,ep070
1155,compromise between what you both want,ep070
1158,sounds good,ep070
1161,I definitely love the combination of a,ep070
1164,gray stone with the red brick and the,ep070
1167,windows are really really nice you're,ep070
1170,only about a 30-minute commute by train,ep070
1173,to your workplace no it sounds like it,ep070
1176,might be a little far to cycle that,ep070
1179,convenient on the train although it,ep070
1182,might be a little noisy in the station's,ep070
1185,right here so it's also a real good,ep070
1188,value it's a four-bed three and half,ep070
1191,bath row home we snap 425 oh that's good,ep070
1194,that's great check it out Thanks come on,ep070
1197,in oh wow it's nice and bright there's,ep070
1200,not really you know defined yeah that's,ep070
1203,where this space what's nice about it I,ep070
1206,mean you can be a living room give me a,ep070
1209,dining room you can push it in the back,ep070
1212,and have it,ep070
1215,good options and look at this you got a,ep070
1218,fireplace nice and contemporary this is,ep070
1221,a row home I bet there was a beautiful,ep070
1224,wood mantel and a wood-burning fireplace,ep070
1227,here originally but yes it was,ep070
1230,completely gutted so that is brand-new,ep070
1233,oh that's a pity one of the things that,ep070
1236,I noticed that the developer did was,ep070
1239,take away all of the charm that you,ep070
1242,expect in an 1885 home he want those,ep070
1245,character pieces that are just missing,ep070
1248,now so a little bit disappointed by that,ep070
1251,oh this is a nice kitchen yeah they've,ep070
1254,done a really nice job it's all very,ep070
1257,clean again okay,ep070
1260,what is this space is this the living,ep070
1263,room then it's another entertaining,ep070
1266,space I mean the space is narrow but it,ep070
1269,is all very long and open so you know,ep070
1272,there's plenty of room no no it just,ep070
1275,seems a little tight in here all right,ep070
1278,you know here is all of your private,ep070
1281,outdoor space oh nice and backyard oh,ep070
1284,that's great I love that the back deck,ep070
1287,is right off the kitchen um there's also,ep070
1290,some grass out there for having me to,ep070
1293,run around back inside they see the,ep070
1296,finished basement here you've got this,ep070
1299,really spacious finished basement I,ep070
1302,think Dustin you'll like this for you,ep070
1305,yeah it looks like be perfect for this,ep070
1308,practice area,ep070
1311,there's no way to you know close off,ep070
1314,this room I'm gonna hear you while I'm,ep070
1317,watching my shows well that's not my,ep070
1320,problem they see a guest bed and bath on,ep070
1323,this level then up two floors to a,ep070
1326,second bedroom and over this way is your,ep070
1329,master suite,ep070
1332,that's nice yeah you can definitely fit,ep070
1335,our bed in here now you got your closet,ep070
1338,here is that the only closet no oh,ep070
1341,perfect that can be my shoe palace,ep070
1344,oh that looks more the size for your,ep070
1347,shoe palace yeah definitely I'm pretty,ep070
1350,sure I'll take this entire closet for,ep070
1353,myself Oh what do you know,ep070
1356,yeah um hers and next door over is your,ep070
1359,in-law suite master bathroom oh it's,ep070
1362,nice and big got a big shower as well,ep070
1365,yeah you wanted a two-person shower I,ep070
1368,think we can both get in there you wanna,ep070
1371,find out probably room for Garret see,ep070
1374,the master suites really nice well laid,ep070
1377,out the vintage facade on the outsides,ep070
1380,really what I'm looking for but once we,ep070
1383,get inside it feels like they've,ep070
1386,stripped away out all the characters so,ep070
1389,I'm a little bit bummed about that which,ep070
1392,is great it's got the contemporary feel,ep070
1395,I definitely like the modern kitchen,ep070
1398,it's really nice and got the outdoor,ep070
1401,space close to the kitchens but it is a,ep070
1404,little bit too far to cycle to work and,ep070
1407,there is the noise from the Train their,ep070
1410,broker has shown them several properties,ep070
1413,with different things to offer so now,ep070
1416,their decision may hinge on price and,ep070
1419,style you ready to make the biggest,ep070
1422,decision of our lives I guess so,ep070
1425,[Music],ep070
1428,I should try the fashion press really,ep070
1431,nice as well engaged couple Nicole and,ep070
1434,"Dunstan have a budget of $500,000 to buy",ep070
1437,their first home in Chicago we need to,ep070
1440,make a final decision on where we're,ep070
1443,gonna live,ep070
1446,I guess we should start with the,ep070
1449,brownstone was it priced at 368 that's,ep070
1452,right one of the things I loved about it,ep070
1455,was just the curb of Hill walking in,ep070
1458,that neighborhood was amazing with the,ep070
1461,old brownstones and the cute yards,ep070
1464,there's still vintage character inside,ep070
1467,the house as well the Bannister was,ep070
1470,still original and you also have two,ep070
1473,fireplaces that are wood-burning but,ep070
1476,there are a lot of projects that have to,ep070
1479,be done in that home to make it you know,ep070
1482,move-in-ready well I mean there is a,ep070
1485,positive in that we can put our own,ep070
1488,stamp on it we can make our own master,ep070
1491,bathroom the way we want it to be maybe,ep070
1494,put in an extra closet for you I know,ep070
1497,there's something you wanted yeah,ep070
1500,definitely if they're it's lacking a,ep070
1503,closet space in there and no I need my,ep070
1506,shoe palace so what about the new,ep070
1509,construction that was priced at 5:29,ep070
1512,uh-huh so that is over our budget but,ep070
1515,we're getting a brand-new place you know,ep070
1518,brand-new kitchen by far the nicest,ep070
1521,kitchen of the ones we saw brand-new,ep070
1524,appliances that whole main area just had,ep070
1527,no character but at least it was,ep070
1530,completely move-in ready so that's,ep070
1533,really convenient but next to the,ep070
1536,fireplace you've got that deck the,ep070
1539,master bathroom was really nice yeah the,ep070
1542,big shower for two people so we should,ep070
1545,talk about the vintage row home yeah so,ep070
1548,that one was priced at 425 yeah I did,ep070
1551,love the curb appeal on that it was,ep070
1554,built in the 1800s it still has that,ep070
1557,look and feel but on the inside they,ep070
1560,stripped away all the real charming,ep070
1563,character it felt really long and narrow,ep070
1566,I mean now on the inside there's no,ep070
1569,produce there for you so you must be,ep070
1572,happy and it's really nice it's a bit,ep070
1575,noisy there with the train so close by,ep070
1578,but we could define the music room down,ep070
1581,in the finished basement are you,ep070
1584,thinking what I'm thinking in terms of,ep070
1587,our final decision,ep070
1590,[Music],ep070
1593,are you leaning towards the vintage row,ep070
1596,huh I think they'll work it had that,ep070
1599,vintage great stone look so I like the,ep070
1602,outside of that place on the inside,ep070
1605,appealed to me and we have a nice open,ep070
1608,floor plan yes an offering okay let's,ep070
1611,call Garrett here we just moved in,ep070
1614,almost two weeks now still unpacking,ep070
1617,everything oh sure I'll take that,ep070
1620,Garrett was able to help us negotiate a,ep070
1623,good deal so we ended up paying four,ep070
1626,hundred five thousand I really feel that,ep070
1629,our new home is a good compromise,ep070
1632,between what me and Dunston want it has,ep070
1635,a vintage appeal on the outside and for,ep070
1638,Dunson it's nice and contemporary on the,ep070
1641,inside yeah that's true,ep070
1644,it's growing on me this open floor plan,ep070
1647,initially I was a little hesitant in,ep070
1650,terms of where we're gonna put things,ep070
1653,but now I can start repositioning things,ep070
1656,and you know modeling the house how I,ep070
1659,wouldn't want the layout to be I think,ep070
1662,Nichole is happy because she's been able,ep070
1665,to find a space for the living room in a,ep070
1668,space for the dining room they serve,ep070
1671,nicely separated by the kitchen time for,ep070
1674,a spot of cedar so although this kitchen,ep070
1677,wasn't quite as fancy as the one we saw,ep070
1680,in the new construction it's pretty good,ep070
1683,it has everything we need and it is very,ep070
1686,new Henry's been enjoying the new house,ep070
1689,as well I think will appreciate the yard,ep070
1692,especially when it warms up a little bit,ep070
1695,we were both worried about this house,ep070
1698,being so close to the train stop but,ep070
1701,once you're inside you can't really hear,ep070
1704,it at all and it's really convenient,ep070
1707,just being able to hop on the train and,ep070
1710,be at work in 20 minutes yeah and it's,ep070
1713,really easy bicycle to work as well it's,ep070
1716,just I think two turns it's kind of a,ep070
1719,long distance but it's doable so I'm,ep070
1722,happy,ep070
1725,but we've done a test now of the band,ep070
1728,playing music barnacles watching TV and,ep070
1731,unfortunately it's a little bit loud for,ep070
1734,her Dunson,ep070
1737,[Music],ep070
1740,we might try moving the music room back,ep070
1743,to the back bedroom downstairs that,ep070
1746,might solve the problem buying a home,ep070
1749,together that means more than just a,ep070
1752,property we're really starting our lives,ep070
1755,together,ep070
12,[Music],ep071
15,this is really nice Dino and his wife,ep071
18,have moved from Boston to Las Vegas and,ep071
21,he won't be satisfied until they buy a,ep071
24,place right on the strip little noisy,ep071
27,being the strictest whole how to be in,ep071
30,Vegas be in the action,ep071
33,she wants a single-family home farther,ep071
36,out I went annoys that I would rather be,ep071
39,near the strip if I'm gonna be hearing,ep071
42,this all day I'm actually really good at,ep071
45,convincing so I can try to learn some,ep071
48,magic you know get him to agree to this,ep071
51,house can she get the upgrade she wants,ep071
54,look at this kitchen for you or will,ep071
57,"their $165,000 budget",ep071
60,mean putting up with some quirks drapes,ep071
63,included drapes included I mean there's,ep071
66,a lot of weeds and a lot of rocks might,ep071
69,be a little awkward people walking by,ep071
72,and seeing us in the bedroom can you see,ep071
75,me,ep071
78,[Music],ep071
81,I wasn't it's an awesome place though,ep071
84,yeah it's so great I think there's over,ep071
87,20 miles for hiking yeah I'm on um 28,ep071
90,I'm Dino I'm 31,ep071
93,originally from Boston Mass we have two,ep071
96,dogs Melly a German Shepherd and Levi a,ep071
99,goldendoodle we're gonna be great to,ep071
102,have a house out here I don't even know,ep071
105,this is Las Vegas anymore we've known,ep071
108,each other since we were kids we grew up,ep071
111,in the same town and it was until maybe,ep071
114,high school we started hanging out,ep071
117,because somebody was stalking me I did,ep071
120,that tell my crushes we got engaged in,ep071
123,Vegas we came for my birthday we went to,ep071
126,a restaurant and I felt the nudging of,ep071
129,the table he's like open it and I was,ep071
132,like what is this it's just like a plain,ep071
135,ring I can wear this like when we go oh,ep071
138,and I was like no it's an engagement,ep071
141,ring it's like wait does my dad know,ep071
144,yeah and he's like yeah yeah so we've,ep071
147,actually been together for a boat 1 9 9,ep071
150,10 11 years 11 okay sorry 11 years I was,ep071
153,close yeah good job married for five and,ep071
156,excited to start out how something out,ep071
159,and Las Vegas so are you guys nervous at,ep071
162,all yes no I am,ep071
165,we just really fell in love with Las,ep071
168,Vegas ever since the first time we came,ep071
171,here we just knew we wanted to move here,ep071
174,the restaurants the shops all the,ep071
177,outdoor activity doesn't show the,ep071
180,different shows like all the different,ep071
183,attractions,ep071
186,I feel like everyone has just such good,ep071
189,positive vibe energy if everyone's here,ep071
192,to have fun so they've decided to leave,ep071
195,Dino's family's dry-cleaning business in,ep071
198,Boston sell their home and furniture and,ep071
201,start a tourism website in Las Vegas it,ep071
204,was really tough leaving the family,ep071
207,business because you know it was,ep071
210,something that we were all involved in,ep071
213,but if we never did it it's something,ep071
216,that we'd always have a regret about not,ep071
219,trying it and we just never wanted to be,ep071
222,those people that said I wish we did,ep071
225,that back then I wish we did it so clean,ep071
228,the house real quick throw it on the,ep071
231,market sold in two days,ep071
234,and pack two duffel bags and came here,ep071
237,oh look that looks like a housewife from,ep071
240,back home so a budget is 165 thousand,ep071
243,that's pretty much it whatever we can,ep071
246,get for that price we'll get I mean I,ep071
249,really wish we could find these type of,ep071
252,homes near the strip the location I'm,ep071
255,looking for is to be right on the strip,ep071
258,I want people to be walking by at 2 in,ep071
261,the morning same what's up welcome to,ep071
264,Vegas part of the reason why Tina wants,ep071
267,to be on this strip is because we are,ep071
270,starting and online tourism business and,ep071
273,he wants to be in the action it's so,ep071
276,much easier to just be able to walk to a,ep071
279,restaurant do a couple quick clips,ep071
282,review the food walk back not have to,ep071
285,drive it'll be nice to be in the action,ep071
288,but then get away from the action away,ep071
291,and relax no one's yelling let's go home,ep071
294,some of these have shutters just like,ep071
297,back home they're hoping to find a home,ep071
300,that resembles the styles they're more,ep071
303,familiar with from New England the style,ep071
306,home that I'm looking for is a more of a,ep071
309,Cape Cod home I just like how it feels,ep071
312,cozy and homey so the type of house that,ep071
315,I'm looking for in Vegas is more of a,ep071
318,Craftsman style home I love the detail I,ep071
321,love the paint I love the trim but,ep071
324,they're realistic about their options in,ep071
327,Vegas it's totally totally different,ep071
330,it's more Mediterranean we'll work with,ep071
333,it Anna also prefers a single-family,ep071
336,home over a condo so the things that I,ep071
339,really want in a home is a yard space,ep071
342,for the two doggies I need more than one,ep071
345,bedrooms people come visit you know for,ep071
348,a home office an updated kitchen a,ep071
351,move-in-ready place is definitely a must,ep071
354,if I'm moving to Vegas I don't want to,ep071
357,be fixing things up and so easy to do a,ep071
360,few custom changes that would be our,ep071
363,touches and it's something that we can,ep071
366,get whatever we like instead of whatever,ep071
369,the person before us wanted Dena would,ep071
372,prefer a smaller condo with amenities on,ep071
375,the strip one-bedroom one-bath I don't,ep071
378,want a lot of space I don't want a lot,ep071
381,of junk and I want to garage to be able,ep071
384,to fill my bikes toys,ep071
387,no one visions not gonna work in one,ep071
390,bath not gonna work definitely more than,ep071
393,one we had three bedrooms back home and,ep071
396,two of them were just full of items that,ep071
399,we couldn't even get into them because,ep071
402,of it it was all somebody's junk buying,ep071
405,this new house for us is an investment,ep071
408,it's a,ep071
411,city so we're a little nervous because,ep071
414,it's a big change so we're on a great,ep071
417,adventure and we're gonna keep going,ep071
420,today I'm showing you guys the nice 1,ep071
423,bedroom 1 bathroom condo and close,ep071
426,proximity to the strip now Dennis how,ep071
429,close to the strip out we we're about,ep071
432,walking distance from all the glamorous,ep071
435,parts of Las Vegas trips but you are but,ep071
438,it still gives you a nice homey feel and,ep071
441,there's plenty of ladies here to enjoy,ep071
444,now we're hoping something with a little,ep071
447,more detail in it with a little bit,ep071
450,stucco framing it's not the most,ep071
453,attractive but this is what you're gonna,ep071
456,see at 90% of construction in Las Vegas,ep071
459,this one's 141 right within your price,ep071
462,range bad HOA HOA fees are 277 that'll,ep071
465,take care of all the ground maintenance,ep071
468,and all the amenities i can'twe that,ep071
471,dennis is bring me to a condo on the,ep071
474,strip after I told him that I didn't,ep071
477,want to be near the strip and especially,ep071
480,it being a 1-bedroom 1-bath I know Ana's,ep071
483,concerned about the size of the unit,ep071
486,however this complex has plenty of,ep071
489,amenities on site multiple pools in,ep071
492,areas where they can workout and things,ep071
495,like that so I'm pretty sure we'll just,ep071
498,be using the home to rest and recoup and,ep071
501,spending most their time out all right,ep071
504,guys here's the condo this is so tiny,ep071
507,what is the square footage this is 692,ep071
510,square feet oh that's small it's only us,ep071
513,in the dark so we don't really need much,ep071
516,more space if we have visitors there's,ep071
519,so many hotels they can stay in you can,ep071
522,feel it,ep071
525,well you know if you only have one,ep071
528,bedroom you can't have any visitors,ep071
531,now the tile was something that I was,ep071
534,looking forward just for easy cleanup I,ep071
537,was kinda hoping for hardwood flooring,ep071
540,floor so much maintenance to it I like,ep071
543,the crown molding the high ceilings are,ep071
546,nice awesome you guys also have a,ep071
549,balcony out here for a nice view it's a,ep071
552,little noisy there like right on the,ep071
555,street,ep071
558,being near the strip is whole part of,ep071
561,being in Vegas to be near the action and,ep071
564,I think this is part of the compromise,ep071
567,to be so close everything and the other,ep071
570,thing is with the dogs they'd be barking,ep071
573,well the neighbors will get used to the,ep071
576,barking on this buck me you guys also,ep071
579,have two storage spots Wow,ep071
582,pretty good size I mean I wanted a,ep071
585,garage but I feel like this to do the,ep071
588,job just trying to put a grill the bikes,ep071
591,a few coolers this property is being,ep071
594,sold as is with the furniture and all so,ep071
597,it comes with everything the couches the,ep071
600,lamps correct that's gonna be tough for,ep071
603,us because we wish for they're gonna,ep071
606,bring an old character and styling here,ep071
609,and these couches are hideous this is,ep071
612,gonna cost us money just to get rid of,ep071
615,the side this stuff now this TV is that,ep071
618,something that comes with the unit,ep071
621,awesome yes it does that's a good thing,ep071
624,let's go ahead and check out the kitchen,ep071
627,oh I mean I like the stainless steel,ep071
630,appliances I like the countertops but,ep071
633,we're gonna be literally on top of each,ep071
636,other though like cooking's awful the,ep071
639,paintings oh that doesn't even open Wow,ep071
642,all right guys I want to show you the,ep071
645,rest of the living quarters back here,ep071
648,you're gonna have your master bedroom oh,ep071
651,wow they fit a king-size bed in it this,ep071
654,furniture is ugly does this come with,ep071
657,the unit awesome yes unfortunately it,ep071
660,does drapes included drapes included Oh,ep071
663,fancy and that's weird the windows,ep071
666,facing right outside I'm gonna go,ep071
669,outside and see how much you can see I,ep071
672,feel a little awkward people walking by,ep071
675,and seeing us in the bedroom can you see,ep071
678,me yeah you can see everything from,ep071
681,outside but the closet sighs looks okay,ep071
684,this isn't really a walk-in closet but I,ep071
687,work before we get to the bathroom this,ep071
690,will be a stackable washer and dryer,ep071
693,that's a little convenient it's right,ep071
696,outside from the bathroom and the,ep071
699,bedrooms well we don't even need a,ep071
702,hamper you've got the same countertops,ep071
705,in here as you had in the kitchen yeah,ep071
708,keeping everything uniform yeah it's a,ep071
711,little small um especially the tub I,ep071
714,could make this work kind of not really,ep071
717,feeling it I have one last thing I,ep071
720,wanted to show you before we leave here,ep071
723,okay so see this is the main pool one of,ep071
726,them nice as amenities they have at the,ep071
729,subdivision it's like a tropical,ep071
732,paradise yeah this is really nice you,ep071
735,guys also have this Clubhouse and a full,ep071
738,gym it doesn't make you feel a little,ep071
741,better,ep071
744,okay I definitely like this outside area,ep071
747,in the pool,ep071
750,the house was really small and I didn't,ep071
753,really want to be on the strip I like to,ep071
756,see something with a bit more space and,ep071
759,off the strip I love the price point,ep071
762,that we're at but I want us to both be,ep071
765,happy so I'm really open to options,ep071
768,Dennis whatever you can show us would be,ep071
771,great so they're seeing a bigger home,ep071
774,off the strip but it comes with some,ep071
777,compromises busy really busy street and,ep071
780,I feel like it needs a lot of work on,ep071
783,[Music],ep071
786,Andina recently relocated from Boston to,ep071
789,Las Vegas to start a new business and,ep071
792,they're looking for a home priced under,ep071
795,"$165,000 they've seen a small",ep071
798,one-bedroom condo right off the strip,ep071
801,his preference but it was too small and,ep071
804,too close to the center of the action,ep071
807,for her today their agent Dennis is,ep071
810,showing them a home about 20 minutes,ep071
813,from the strip in West Vegas this one's,ep071
816,listed for 164 nine it's really close to,ep071
819,budget it doesn't look like for you mr.,ep071
822,bean the other strip if I'm gonna be,ep071
825,hearing this all day and this is a,ep071
828,busier Street however this is a quieter,ep071
831,neighborhood you do get a yard you do,ep071
834,get a two-car garage on this one this,ep071
837,might be a problem,ep071
840,yeah especially for the dog yeah they've,ep071
843,reiterated multiple times they wanted a,ep071
846,craftsman or a Cape Cod house but being,ep071
849,from Las Vegas all we see is stucco and,ep071
852,brick so we'll have to show them that,ep071
855,maybe their taste is not what's going to,ep071
858,actually be within their price range was,ep071
861,expecting it actually be pretty finished,ep071
864,yeah I love the hardwood floor,ep071
867,I wish it wasn't I'll we've got plenty,ep071
870,of space for your TV here on the wall,ep071
873,yeah already cable TV wired yeah I'm not,ep071
876,a big fan popcorn ceiling but we can,ep071
879,change it down the road and this is very,ep071
882,easy to scrape off should take you about,ep071
885,a day or so and you'd have a whole new,ep071
888,ceiling yeah,ep071
891,that's a pretty simple kitchen you've,ep071
894,got cabinets on this side and that side,ep071
897,okay it's kind of like a galley kitchen,ep071
900,yeah there's a little bit of updating,ep071
903,being so close to our budget it's gonna,ep071
906,be tough yeah it's gonna be tough with,ep071
909,our understand the appliances aren't the,ep071
912,best quality however they are functional,ep071
915,so you can just use these as soon as you,ep071
918,move in save up some money for some time,ep071
921,and replace them whenever you get a,ep071
924,chance that's something we could do with,ep071
927,yeah definitely be able to cook together,ep071
930,know what we like to do all right check,ep071
933,out the backyard,ep071
936,okay let's see one thing that we both,ep071
939,wanted it was a little yard this art is,ep071
942,huge it has so much potential for your,ep071
945,dogs oh my goodness I mean there's a lot,ep071
948,of weeds and a lot of rocks that's for,ep071
951,the dogs but ya know if I wanted this so,ep071
954,much space yeah well I figured you guys,ep071
957,wanted to see little something a little,ep071
960,bit different than what you've seen so,ep071
963,far so I brought you something with,ep071
966,space I love that this is a house and,ep071
969,not a condo it just feels so much homier,ep071
972,to me especially coming cross-country,ep071
975,want to feel like home see the bedroom,ep071
978,right here is your guest bathroom oh,ep071
981,haha this is ugly,ep071
984,I mean this is just all over the place,ep071
987,even the toilet and the shower that's,ep071
990,not pretty,ep071
993,yeah I mean getting around your price,ep071
996,range I mean you have to deal with a,ep071
999,little bit of these things,ep071
1002,this here is bedroom number one that's a,ep071
1005,good size though this here is gonna be,ep071
1008,your master with plenty of space plenty,ep071
1011,of sunlight and you also get a nice,ep071
1014,walk-in closet with this one yeah this,ep071
1017,is actually a main size this is perfect,ep071
1020,for us oh yes it does it looks smaller,ep071
1023,than a guest bathroom,ep071
1026,strange I needed a little bit of,ep071
1029,updating alright guys let me show you,ep071
1032,the third bedroom the smallest of all of,ep071
1035,them but I think it'd be a great space,ep071
1038,for an office yeah I think it definitely,ep071
1041,work as an office but I really didn't,ep071
1044,want this in my space I want a,ep071
1047,one-bedroom and we're talking about,ep071
1050,three I do not do very well we've been,ep071
1053,together for so long that I'm kind of,ep071
1056,good at convincing I'm actually really,ep071
1059,good at convincing so I can try to work,ep071
1062,some magic you know get him to agree to,ep071
1065,this house I know that this is a near,ep071
1068,the strip Deano but I like the layout of,ep071
1071,the house with the three bedrooms and in,ep071
1074,the neighborhood it's not what I wanted,ep071
1077,but I think it's something that I can,ep071
1080,consider the only thing is I mean I'm,ep071
1083,scared that we're gonna go over budget,ep071
1086,I mean at one 60-49 dennis is not much,ep071
1089,room for us to do any improvements,ep071
1092,understood and I can see what I could do,ep071
1095,about working on the price for you in,ep071
1098,the meantime,ep071
1101,dennis has lined up a potential,ep071
1104,compromise Boston transplants Dino and,ep071
1107,"Anna have a $165,000 budget for a home",ep071
1110,in Vegas so far they've seen a small,ep071
1113,condo on the strip,ep071
1116,Dino's preferences and a bigger,ep071
1119,single-family home in the burbs honest,ep071
1122,preference today their agent dennis has,ep071
1125,lined up a condo 15 minutes from the,ep071
1128,strip looks good I just want to show you,ep071
1131,this complex before we actually go to,ep071
1134,the unit oK you've got the pool right,ep071
1137,here and the spa okay and your covered,ep071
1140,parking spot so I'm guessing no garage,ep071
1143,all right no garage there's one covered,ep071
1146,parking yeah however you do have grass,ep071
1149,for your animals in case they need to,ep071
1152,relieve themselves,ep071
1155,how about storage ah storage is on the,ep071
1158,side of the building okay okay,ep071
1161,listed at 135 well below your price,ep071
1164,range,ep071
1167,a lot of money HOAs are 163 a month on,ep071
1170,this one that's awesome itself two,ep071
1173,bedrooms two baths then 136 square feet,ep071
1176,it's not our style but Vegas yeah we're,ep071
1179,gonna have to settle with this look so I,ep071
1182,really wanted something you have a strip,ep071
1185,but the price point of this one it's,ep071
1188,really got me thinking,ep071
1191,"saving 30,000 I think I might consider",ep071
1194,making that 15-minute Drive talk about,ep071
1197,move-in ready so updated I like it in,ep071
1200,here it makes up for the planned,ep071
1203,exterior you have more than enough wall,ep071
1206,space for your TV I know that was a big,ep071
1209,deal for you Dino I definitely love the,ep071
1212,baseboard I love the white on the gray I,ep071
1215,really wish there was tile on the house,ep071
1218,I don't mind the hair before but look at,ep071
1221,this kitchen off for you this is amazing,ep071
1224,it has everything that I wanted it's so,ep071
1227,updated with the stainless steel,ep071
1230,appliances and look at that the,ep071
1233,backsplash that's so pretty,ep071
1236,and I really like these cabinets and,ep071
1239,everything - yeah these are nice,ep071
1242,cabinets,ep071
1245,I feel like I'm one of those people that,ep071
1248,people make fun of remaining stainless,ep071
1251,steel appliances think of it like oh god,ep071
1254,here's another one but they're nice they,ep071
1257,look good in the thing either way I'm,ep071
1260,gonna get it before we go to the bedroom,ep071

1278,enough space in this unit to actually,ep071
1281,have to a washer and dryer and that's,ep071
1284,really convenient too it's like right in,ep071
1287,the middle right let's check out the,ep071
1290,first bedroom here,ep071
1293,huge closet with three doors oh wow I'm,ep071
1296,not too crazy about the carpet,ep071
1299,it does look updated clean I like the,ep071
1302,color and an actual ensuite bathroom,ep071
1305,that was this semester this is gonna be,ep071
1308,the master bath,ep071
1311,yeah it's a little tight I don't know if,ep071
1314,we would be able to fit a king,ep071
1317,oh it's tight yeah it's a little tiny,ep071
1320,there's a lot of gray great bathroom,ep071
1323,great bedroom green living room great,ep071
1326,kitchen I mean there's gonna be a lot of,ep071
1329,painting to do to get a little bit of,ep071
1332,character they see the second bath and,ep071
1335,bedroom this could work as an office Rea,ep071
1338,good-size room for it I wasn't looking,ep071
1341,for a condo but I really don't mind this,ep071
1344,space because it feels so homey I wish I,ep071
1347,could just pick it up and just put it,ep071
1350,right on the strip that would be perfect,ep071
1353,we know that you love this trip but we,ep071
1356,need to like go away from the strip to,ep071
1359,relax a little bit it's a quiet,ep071
1362,neighborhood hey from Boston to be near,ep071
1365,the strip we're gonna be away from the,ep071
1368,strip might as well go back home you,ep071
1371,know you guys I would say you guys need,ep071
1374,to come with a compromise because with,ep071
1377,your criteria,ep071
1380,within your price range is not too much,ep071
1383,out there searching for this unique form,ep071
1386,of property I don't know if we're ever,ep071
1389,gonna find it after seeing several,ep071
1392,options it won't be an easy choice for,ep071
1395,Ana and Dino their decision might come,ep071
1398,down to size location and condition how,ep071
1401,did you sleep last night,ep071
1404,I'm not too good how about you no I got,ep071
1407,it oh we need to figure out where we,ep071
1410,want to stay,ep071
1413,[Music],ep071
1416,Deno and anna has seen how much house,ep071
1419,"$165,000 will get them in las vegas now",ep071
1422,it's time to decide can we please talk,ep071
1425,about the condo on the strip yeah it was,ep071
1428,only 141 land a budget and we're right,ep071
1431,in the middle of everything in the,ep071
1434,kitchen was upgraded which is exactly,ep071
1437,what you wanted yeah but it also just,ep071
1440,had one bedroom one bath there was no,ep071
1443,yard for the dogs I didn't like the fact,ep071
1446,that the bedroom window was facing the,ep071
1449,outside like anyone could look in it was,ep071
1452,a busy street it's pretty noisy what,ep071
1455,about that traditional branch that was,ep071
1458,in the suburbs and that was nice it has,ep071
1461,the three bedrooms the hardwood floors a,ep071
1464,big yard for the dogs I knew you'd like,ep071
1467,that one but that's so much space I,ep071
1470,didn't want three bedrooms we left,ep071
1473,Boston with a three bedroom home and we,ep071
1476,don't used one and remember the exterior,ep071
1479,remember how much work that was yeah and,ep071
1482,that was on the top of her budget,ep071
1485,it was one 60-49 for me though it's just,ep071
1488,a little too far from this trip what,ep071
1491,about that updated two-bedroom Spanish,ep071
1494,condo below our budget,ep071
1497,it was 135 but if I'm gonna get a condo,ep071
1500,I just want to be any other strip yeah,ep071
1503,but what about that kitchen everything,ep071
1506,was updated if I could just pick up that,ep071
1509,condo and put it right on the strip I,ep071
1512,think that'd be my ideal home we came,ep071
1515,here to be near the strip and although,ep071
1518,that condo near the strip was small,ep071
1521,think about all the amenities yeah I,ep071
1524,mean it did have a nice pool and I did,ep071
1527,have the gym we have two single home,ep071
1530,back home let's try something different,ep071
1533,let's be in the middle of everything and,ep071
1536,actually live it does sound like fun I,ep071
1539,think it would be a lot of fun all right,ep071
1542,I think we should call Dennis I think we,ep071
1545,brought more shoes than clothes with us,ep071
1548,guess we brought the essentials so we,ep071
1551,ended up getting the condo on the strip,ep071
1554,it was listed at 141 nine and we gave an,ep071
1557,offer 139 and they accepted it yes we've,ep071
1560,been here for about three weeks,ep071
1563,so the house did come furnished but we,ep071
1566,decided to get rid of the couch and buy,ep071
1569,a new couch the TV I was hoping to be,ep071
1572,able to change it and get something,ep071
1575,bigger but hey if it works keep it and,ep071
1578,although we only have one bedroom we got,ep071
1581,a big enough couch that oh my god this,ep071
1584,thing can sleep like two people,ep071
1587,comfortably it doesn't have much space,ep071
1590,but how often are we in here we just,ep071
1593,come here and sleep cook and go out got,ep071
1596,you no matter about this place are you,ep071
1599,look at this no not at all I think it's,ep071
1602,great I really really enjoy being out on,ep071
1605,the balcony I just love the fresh air,ep071
1608,and I know I complain about the noisy,ep071
1611,road but it actually doesn't bother me,ep071
1614,we do a lot of work on the balcony,ep071
1617,actually and it's really nice to be able,ep071
1620,to get the fresh air while we work I,ep071
1623,think the dyes are getting used to it we,ep071
1626,bring them for walks we on the strip,ep071
1629,almost every night what some other words,ep071
1632,for like tasty like I'm trying to,ep071
1635,describe that dish I made a lot of,ep071
1638,compromises with Tina,ep071
1641,especially on this place on the strip,ep071
1644,but after sitting down and talking about,ep071
1647,it made more sense to be where we are,ep071
1650,right now because we are trying to do,ep071
1653,the business in down the road I'll give,ep071
1656,her her three bedroom three bath house,ep071
1659,with the biggest closet that you could,ep071
1662,ever imagine,ep071
1665,I think it's on the cheese crackers they,ep071
1668,need some wine,ep071
1671,we'll get the bottle the house-hunting,ep071
1674,process was a little tough but we found,ep071
1677,what we wanted and now we're just in a,ep071
1680,settle in have fun and enjoy Vegas very,ep071
1683,nice,ep071
1686,[Music],ep071

24,so colorful here and they've got an,ep072
27,innovative way to finance their,ep072
30,relocation her on travelers visa so,ep072
33,we're not actually allowed to get jobs,ep072
36,but we can solve that rooms in our house,ep072
39,but first they have to find one so you,ep072
42,guys gonna walk in and just start,ep072
45,business tomorrow oh wow,ep072
48,feels like a little jungle here there's,ep072
51,gonna be some work that you have to do,ep072
54,oh I don't mind the extra work Shawn's,ep072
57,all gung-ho to do a little rhino,ep072
60,I just don't actually want to have been,ep072
63,worried that we're gonna get in,ep072
66,over budget,ep072
69,[Applause],ep072
72,[Music],ep072
75,just think when we actually get a host,ep072
78,on the beach and go right from our,ep072
81,living room to the yard to the beach and,ep072
84,just surf right out I'm a registered,ep072
87,nurse,ep072
90,in Calgary the last 12 years I've kind,ep072
93,of gotten burned out I've always kind of,ep072
96,had this in the back of my head for the,ep072
99,last few years that I want to lead,ep072
102,Calgary I've been a sheriff in the,ep072
105,province of Alberta actually for about,ep072
108,12 years now I just knew there was more,ep072
111,to life than that so they turned to,ep072
114,their passion for travel for inspiration,ep072
117,I fell in love with surfing so I decided,ep072
120,that I was gonna travel around and find,ep072
123,awesome places in the world to surf and,ep072
126,ended up in Nicaragua the trip was,ep072
129,amazing the girl was amazing and I think,ep072
132,that's kind of why we're back here,ep072
135,that's pretty cute I know we could just,ep072
138,like literally walk out the door and,ep072
141,just sir when we're not taking flies we,ep072
144,spent the next two and a half years,ep072
147,saving money and we basically sold off,ep072
150,everything that we have it is really,ep072
153,scary to leave everything you know and,ep072
156,just kind of take a risk we just had all,ep072
159,this money in the bank account that we,ep072
162,could just kind of use for whatever he,ep072
165,wanted and what we wanted was to move to,ep072
168,Nicaragua I'll come back alive you will,ep072
171,see okay,ep072
174,it's something that I've dreamed about,ep072
177,doing for years just to like wake up and,ep072
180,know you're in Nicaragua and you're,ep072
183,looking for a place to call home doesn't,ep072
186,feel real,ep072
189,people are moving to Nicaragua and,ep072
192,they're really seeing the kind of life,ep072
195,that they want to live on the northwest,ep072
198,shore of Nicaragua las penitas and Puna,ep072
201,Loya are actually the same beach,ep072
204,separated by a large outcropping of,ep072
207,rocks Sean wants to live in the south,ep072
210,near the lively bars and restaurants of,ep072
213,las penitas beach while Aaron prefers,ep072
216,the quieter vibe of corner lawyer unless,ep072
219,penitas and pone la are sort of the the,ep072
222,beach paradise what are you guys looking,ep072
225,to do we want to live on the beach and,ep072
228,we would like at some point to be able,ep072
231,to rent out some of the rooms in the,ep072
234,place rental income for sure okay,ep072
237,poni law in las penitas people are,ep072
240,buying houses and turning them into,ep072
243,vacation rentals this is the spot I'm,ep072
246,looking for bedrooms,ep072
249,I would like three bedrooms we moved,ep072
252,down here so that we could kind of relax,ep072
255,and enjoy life and I don't want to spend,ep072
258,all of our time trying to manage these,ep072
261,rooms I want to be closer to the center,ep072
264,of the village I think it's gonna help,ep072
267,as far as client and foot traffic I want,ep072
270,to have some peace and quiet what kind,ep072
273,of budget are we talking about for us is,ep072
276,800 so we don't have an income while,ep072
279,we're down here yeah we're definitely on,ep072
282,a budget all right we can maybe stretch,ep072
285,that 800 out just a little bit more if,ep072
288,the house has everything we wanted,ep072
291,budget for me is really really important,ep072
294,I don't want to be stressing about money,ep072
297,down here that's not why we came down,ep072
300,here why don't we get started,ep072
303,absolutely this house right on the beach,ep072
306,in a really nice part of Las Vegas where,ep072
309,they're gonna be getting the traffic,ep072
312,that they want this is a 3 bed 3 bath,ep072
315,this is exactly the size that Aaron,ep072
318,wanted Sean wanted something a little,ep072
321,bit bigger say it's super authentic,ep072
324,Nicaragua,ep072
327,and here we are absolutely ridiculous,ep072
330,are you kidding me beautiful it's a,ep072
333,3-bedroom 2bath so okay it's not the,ep072
336,biggest property we're gonna see but I,ep072
339,still think it can work for what you,ep072
342,guys want to do I think you guys are,ep072
345,gonna be pleasantly surprised this place,ep072
348,is only 700 bucks a month I'm serious,ep072
351,yeah that's awesome that's fantastic,ep072
354,that's under budget I'm totally shocked,ep072
357,by the price of this house I did not,ep072
360,expect that driving up and seeing it for,ep072
363,the first time come on in guys this is,ep072
366,the master bedroom with a little sitting,ep072
369,room living area as well yeah this is,ep072
372,really nice in here you got a nice big,ep072
375,window here good light I'm thinking,ep072
378,about you wanting four bedrooms and I,ep072
381,think it might be possible to punch a,ep072
384,hole in that wall put in the door close,ep072
387,this off and then you could have the,ep072
390,fourth bedroom for additional income I,ep072
393,really like that idea it would be nice,ep072
396,to have the extra room to rent Oh seems,ep072
399,like a lot of work I don't mind the,ep072
402,extra work on estate it would kind of,ep072
405,give me something to do and get a little,ep072
408,greasy hear me think about it,ep072
411,Aaron and I have done a lot of,ep072
414,renovations on a house before so,ep072
417,understand why she doesn't want to get,ep072
420,into that again this is the ensuite,ep072
423,bathroom take a look a functional oiler,ep072
426,yes cleanest bayad but what's what's,ep072
429,with the light fixture and the,ep072
432,electrical box right in the shower,ep072
435,not so much code in Nicaragua when you,ep072
438,see something like that water next to,ep072
441,electricity we call the Nicaraguan widow,ep072
444,Aaron and I might not have to have that,ep072
447,conversation about that fourth bedroom,ep072
450,if she convinces me to use that shower,ep072
453,with the Widowmaker I may not be around,ep072
456,for it this is one of the two bedrooms,ep072
459,that shares the bathroom it's big it is,ep072
462,big there's gonna be some work that you,ep072
465,have to do is a little bit of paint to,ep072
468,do or I wall repair this is the bathroom,ep072
471,there's a shared bathroom between the,ep072
474,two bedrooms okay simple bathroom sink,ep072
477,this bedroom is the moneymaker look at,ep072
480,the view of this window you can see the,ep072
483,ocean from this room what's in you can,ep072
486,even hear the waves from here - yeah,ep072
489,that's that's awesome yeah this is the,ep072
492,kitchen yes,ep072
495,Maseo the kitchen has a nice open feel,ep072
498,you're looking out onto the living area,ep072
501,I like it,ep072
504,so this is the beachfront guys that's,ep072
507,beautiful right it's a really nice surf,ep072
510,break right off front door after coffee,ep072
513,and just hop in the water,ep072
516,I am absolutely surprised that this is,ep072
519,actually under our budget of $800 it's,ep072
522,more than I ever thought we'd be able to,ep072
525,afford there's a little bit more work,ep072
528,that we wouldn't initially need to put,ep072
531,into the house I think I was a little,ep072
534,bit of a downside because we will have,ep072
537,to invest that money and I'm crying I,ep072
540,don't mind the extra work I really do,ep072
543,like how Phocis to the beach and the,ep072
546,yard is absolutely massive and I really,ep072
549,like the house but it doesn't have that,ep072
552,extra room what I really wanted when it,ep072
555,comes to putting a hole in the wall to,ep072
558,make that fourth bedroom I understand,ep072
561,Aaron is a little bit concerned about it,ep072
564,that fourth bedroom to me is very,ep072
567,important I think it's gonna be more,ep072
570,work than and we probably initially,ep072
573,think Jordan has a surprise in store,ep072
576,when house to the fact that this house,ep072
579,has a pool,ep072
582,for me is fantastic the pool wasn't even,ep072
585,on our wish list at all it's gonna be,ep072
588,outside of your budget,ep072
591,ooh holy moly look at that me,ep072
594,you guys forgot about your budget,ep072
597,already my love for travelling kind of,ep072
600,action started around the same time that,ep072
603,I fell in love with surfing Aaron found,ep072
606,the surf she was looking for in las,ep072
609,penitas Nicaragua a hot spot for sport,ep072
612,fishing and boat tours also a paradise,ep072
615,for travelers the tiny village is only,ep072
618,20 minutes from Nicaragua second-largest,ep072
621,city,ep072
624,Leon but you wouldn't know it from the,ep072
627,rustic adventures available here,ep072
630,[Music],ep072
633,crocodile Ana it wasn't hard for Aaron,ep072
636,to convince her boyfriend Shawn to join,ep072
639,her like I've never really met anybody,ep072
642,like Shawn who's just like so willing so,ep072
645,open to just do whatever errand early,ep072
648,brings out my outgoing adventurous,ep072
651,nature 20 penis sharks in here you want,ep072
654,a house that we can rent out rooms we,ep072
657,have a little bit of extra income to,ep072
660,sustain what we have saved up we've,ep072
663,spent time together doing renovations,ep072
666,which is fine but it's not really,ep072
669,something that I want to do down here in,ep072
672,the heat I prefer a place that's kind of,ep072
675,move-in ready and start renting rooms,ep072
678,almost right away 3-bedroom 2bath but i,ep072
681,still think it can work for what you,ep072
684,guys want to do might be possible to,ep072
687,punch a hole in that wall and then you,ep072
690,could have the fourth bedroom for,ep072
693,additional income I think having that,ep072
696,fourth bedroom will definitely increase,ep072
699,the rental potential it seems like a lot,ep072
702,of work since we sold everything at home,ep072
705,and we're just relying on our savings,ep072
708,coming down here but the amount of money,ep072
711,that we need to put up front and the,ep072
714,maintenance that might be required,ep072
717,there's a little bit concerned so we're,ep072
720,gonna try and work that out I'm gonna,ep072
723,show them a couple things that are a,ep072
726,little bit more turnkey so at the end of,ep072
729,the day it's gonna come down to who gets,ep072
732,to say in the matter,ep072
735,house 2 is located much closer to the,ep072
738,center of las penitas where Shawn scores,ep072
741,with the bar and restaurant scene steps,ep072
744,away but Aaron will have to sacrifice,ep072
747,the peace and tranquility she craves all,ep072
750,right guys the house we're gonna see now,ep072
753,is totally furnished just ready to rent,ep072
756,tomorrow here we are,ep072
759,it's massive air nice huge I did a gate,ep072
762,there's a four-bedroom four-bath okay,ep072
765,beachfront it's got a pool whoo bonus,ep072
768,the house is totally turnkey it's gonna,ep072
771,be outside of your budget but I think,ep072
774,that it has a lot of potential in terms,ep072
777,of rental income and I know that's,ep072
780,important to you guys,ep072
783,"define over budget it's $1,100 a month",ep072
786,Oh Connelly Jordan what are we doing,ep072
789,here but I love the fact that this house,ep072
792,has a pool,ep072
795,I think clients are gonna love that oh,ep072
798,wow this is beautiful and so open I love,ep072
801,the open concept it's talking to me,ep072
804,Jordan yes it's going yeah I thought you,ep072
807,guys might like this yeah everything's,ep072
810,included in this purchase so you guys,ep072
813,gonna walk in and just start business,ep072
816,tomorrow all right guys so this is the,ep072
819,pool,ep072
822,we weren't expecting a pool see,ep072
825,fantastic the one thing I worry about a,ep072
828,little bit is maintenance that comes,ep072
831,with a pool you're handy but I don't,ep072
834,know how much you know about pool me,ep072
837,zero from Canada we don't have pools in,ep072
840,Canada so at least where we're from this,ep072
843,is one of the guest bedrooms guys wow,ep072
846,this is a really nice-sized room,ep072
849,that's an ensuite bathroom there's an,ep072
852,ensuite in three of the four bedrooms,ep072
855,there's a lot of bathroom to you to,ep072
858,clean yeah maybe a very busy man yeah I,ep072
861,don't think that we,ep072
864,need to have that many rooms in that,ep072
867,many bathrooms,ep072
870,I think Aaron is concerned about the,ep072
873,price of this place I don't think she,ep072
876,sees the potential with the clientele,ep072
879,market that we'll be able to hit with,ep072
882,all the luxuries that this has another,ep072
885,guest room come in and check this out,ep072
888,all right,ep072
891,built-in closet there I like the bumpin,ep072
894,top bunk haha very Nicaraguan the colors,ep072
897,that's right this is the master suite,ep072
900,this room is awesome king-size bed yeah,ep072
903,I know we've never had a bed even close,ep072
906,to that size of Canada so this is what,ep072
909,you guys are gonna be waking up to every,ep072
912,morning holy moly look at that view I,ep072
915,love it I ain't gonna spend a lot of,ep072
918,time here seems like you guys forgot,ep072
921,about your budget already alright guys,ep072
924,let's check out the sunset deck this is,ep072
927,where you'll be spending your afternoons,ep072
930,winding down your busy day this view up,ep072
933,here is so amazing it's ridiculous it's,ep072
936,but I still just really concern about,ep072
939,the cost associated with it we're gonna,ep072
942,get over our head I think when Tara and,ep072
945,I sit down well I'm just gonna show her,ep072
948,the numbers and sure that this is a,ep072
951,viable option so spending that extra,ep072
954,little bit of money we're definitely,ep072
957,gonna make it in return feels like a,ep072
960,little jungle here these are the,ep072
963,bathrooms for the whole house and it's,ep072
966,right at your budget that's fantastic,ep072
969,but sharing the bathrooms with the,ep072
972,guests there's a little bit weird John's,ep072
975,gonna have to put on pants pants,ep072
978,overrated think you could blow a hole in,ep072
981,the wall build a small bathroom I'm just,ep072
984,a little bit worried that blowing a hole,ep072
987,in the wall like the hole in our budget,ep072
990,[Music],ep072
993,sound really starting to grow it,ep072
996,screaming oh look at this guy Aaron and,ep072
999,Shaun want to trade their fast-paced,ep072
1002,life for the slowly in Nicaragua I found,ep072
1005,Calgary very hectic his life would just,ep072
1008,revolves around and work well I'm a lot,ep072
1011,more laid back than earnest muchas,ep072
1014,gracias,ep072
1017,so he's kind of taught me how to just be,ep072
1020,a little more easygoing and not in such,ep072
1023,a stress case as much after falling in,ep072
1026,love with las peñitas they decided to,ep072
1029,rent a home here I mean we sold,ep072
1032,everything in Canada to come down here,ep072
1035,I'm really excited to see what he has to,ep072
1038,show us actually I know it's really,ep072
1041,important for us to have at least a,ep072
1044,couple rooms that we are able to rent,ep072
1047,out so we have a little extra income for,ep072
1050,me sticking to budget is kind of very,ep072
1053,very important Aaron just wants a,ep072
1056,turnkey property that she can just move,ep072
1059,right on into I don't mind getting a,ep072
1062,little bit dirty and doing some work,ep072
1065,here I think a little bit of work and a,ep072
1068,little bit of effort we can make this,ep072
1071,exactly what we dreamed of having might,ep072
1074,be possible to punch a hole in that wall,ep072
1077,and then you could have the fourth,ep072
1080,bedroom for additional income,ep072
1083,seems like a lot of work I don't mind,ep072
1086,the extra work honesty this place is,ep072
1089,only 700 bucks a month there's a,ep072
1092,four-bedroom four-bath okay you guys,ep072
1095,gonna walk in and just start business,ep072
1098,tomorrow,ep072
1101,"whoo ona $1,100 a month oh I think Aaron",ep072
1104,is concerned about the price of this,ep072
1107,place but the more Jordan was talking,ep072
1110,about having a different type of,ep072
1113,clientele than we were initially looking,ep072
1116,for this is the pool this is fantastic,ep072
1119,the more I was buying what he was saying,ep072
1122,with few rental options in las penitas,ep072
1125,they moved to Bona Loya beach it's,ep072
1128,really the same beach it's only divided,ep072
1131,by a large rock outcropping between the,ep072
1134,two called la pena de estudiante the,ep072
1137,rock of the student,ep072
1140,it separates busy las peñitas from,ep072
1143,quieter phone Aloha where there's more,ep072
1146,room to surf right up Aaron's alley,ep072
1149,so I'm bringing them to a colonial-style,ep072
1152,beachfront home this is a really,ep072
1155,charming house it brings people in,ep072
1158,because when they come to Nicaragua they,ep072
1161,want to have a Nicaraguan experience and,ep072
1164,this is just quintessential Nicaragua,ep072
1167,Juana Loya is traditionally much more,ep072
1170,family oriented whereas us to neat this,ep072
1173,is more business oriented for me I kind,ep072
1176,of like the idea of being more local and,ep072
1179,not so business oriented all right guys,ep072
1182,Wow look at all the trees feels like a,ep072
1185,little jungle here well it provides a,ep072
1188,lot of shade and it keeps everything,ep072
1191,super cool in here amazing yeah so the,ep072
1194,house is a four-bedroom two-bath so they,ep072
1197,put some money into it it's got new roof,ep072
1200,new electrical new plumbing and it's,ep072
1203,right at your budget 800 bucks,ep072
1206,that's fantastic this is your beachfront,ep072
1209,kitchen oh my gosh this is humanity,ep072
1212,massive it's got everything in here in a,ep072
1215,microwave microwave that has everything,ep072
1218,that we need I love the way it's set up,ep072
1221,the cement countertops and the wood,ep072
1224,cabinets and everything it's just a it's,ep072
1227,a perfect kitchen,ep072
1230,this is the outdoor area looking out on,ep072
1233,to the waves that is beautiful take a,ep072
1236,look at the master bedroom it's actually,ep072
1239,set up right now with a number of,ep072
1242,different beds for rental income but I,ep072
1245,think this is probably be the room that,ep072
1248,you guys would want to look yeah really,ep072
1251,big room that's quite large high,ep072
1254,ceilings make it feel really open in,ep072
1257,here yeah yeah I don't see a bathroom in,ep072
1260,or around this room so there's no master,ep072
1263,bath there is no master bath if you guys,ep072
1266,wanted to I think you could blow a hole,ep072
1269,in the wall build a small bathroom maybe,ep072
1272,a couple grand and solve that problem,ep072
1275,I'm just a little bit worried that,ep072
1278,blowing a hole in the wall might just,ep072
1281,blow a hole in our budget a little bit,ep072
1284,you need the sledgehammer and a husband,ep072
1287,yeah oh that's your taking away all the,ep072
1290,fun for me you'll notice that all the,ep072
1293,bedrooms are in a row here along with,ep072
1296,the bathroom does a very Nicaraguan,ep072
1299,style yeah this is the first of the,ep072
1302,three bedrooms okay it's clean it's,ep072
1305,simple it's kind of everything we need,ep072
1308,for a spare room anyway the rooms are a,ep072
1311,decent size but they do need like a coat,ep072
1314,of paint and maybe some new mattresses,ep072
1317,to make them ready to be rented out I,ep072
1320,don't think I'd be comfortable renting,ep072
1323,them in the condition that they are we,ep072
1326,got two bathroom,ep072
1329,that are identical back-to-back,ep072
1332,basically and these are the bathrooms,ep072
1335,for the whole house oh that's an,ep072
1338,interesting kind of stuff set up yeah,ep072
1341,between the rooms,ep072
1344,yeah and just not having like our own,ep072
1347,private bathroom means you know we can't,ep072
1350,keep our stuff in the bathroom sharing,ep072
1353,the bathrooms with the guests there's a,ep072
1356,little bit weird when Sean's gonna have,ep072
1359,to put on pants which is just,ep072
1362,unacceptable really pants are were,ep072
1365,treated I'm not walking around my own,ep072
1368,house wearing pants all the time yeah,ep072
1371,this is Ponte Loya beachfront yeah this,ep072
1374,is beautiful deal some really consistent,ep072
1377,waves out here I'll be staying cooler,ep072
1380,under the ranch oh there you go yeah,ep072
1383,exactly,ep072
1386,good place to watch the sunset for sure,ep072
1389,overall would you just think about the,ep072
1392,house I like this location because it is,ep072
1395,quiet and just really,ep072
1398,the only thing that and I really didn't,ep072
1401,like about the house it wasn't in las,ep072
1404,peñitas and there wanted something,ep072
1407,closer to the restaurant plus penitas,ep072
1410,definitely has more restaurants but this,ep072
1413,is a little bit more laid-back and a,ep072
1416,little bit more,ep072
1419,tranquilo as they say here I honestly,ep072
1422,don't like the location in this home,ep072
1425,it's just too far removed from what I,ep072
1428,wanted but it is a bigger house that's,ep072
1431,actually on budget I know Aaron and I,ep072
1434,are gonna have to compromise on some,ep072
1437,things but I definitely don't want to,ep072
1440,compromise that much let's discuss so do,ep072
1443,we want to live in that big white house,ep072
1446,at the pool it was $300 over but it was,ep072
1449,but definitely had potential on Aaron's,ep072
1452,fourth trip to Nicaragua she and her,ep072
1455,boyfriend Shaun are looking for a home,ep072
1458,in las penitas but being on travelers,ep072
1461,thesis has a downside,ep072
1464,so we're not actually allowed to get,ep072
1467,jobs but as long as we can sublet rooms,ep072
1470,in our house that's fine then that,ep072
1473,should definitely help us sustain our,ep072
1476,life we head down here I'm getting that,ep072
1479,started we'll take a compromise between,ep072
1482,Sean's desire to live close to the,ep072
1485,action in a home he can renovate and,ep072
1488,Aaron's preference for a turnkey home in,ep072
1491,a quieter spot so that was quite the day,ep072
1494,we ought to be looking at how exactly so,ep072
1497,look that first one that that smaller,ep072
1500,way house we've got massive yard,ep072
1503,absolutely ridiculous this yard feels,ep072
1506,like an oasis to me it's just,ep072
1509,spectacular as soon as you walk in and,ep072
1512,everywhere in the house you can see here,ep072
1515,the ocean is pretty awesome had that,ep072
1518,master suite which was Tony separate,ep072
1521,from the other bedrooms did need quite a,ep072
1524,bit of work or they were ready to be,ep072
1527,rented oh I don't mind the extra work,ep072
1530,honestly though it kind of gave me,ep072
1533,something and then it wasn't fully,ep072
1536,furnished so we'd have to be investing,ep072
1539,that money upfront so Google under than,ep072
1542,that big white house with a pool it's,ep072
1545,kind of move-in ready to go which I,ep072
1548,really like that outdoor living space,ep072
1551,the kitchen four bedrooms and four,ep072
1554,bathrooms a little bit more than,ep072
1557,it's talking to me Jordan okay yes it's,ep072
1560,going yeah seems like a lot of Damon's,ep072
1563,second-story balcony over the ocean $300,ep072
1566,over but it was but definitely had,ep072
1569,potential for more income and then there,ep072
1572,was that big yellow colonial right on,ep072
1575,budget the four bedrooms are just,ep072
1578,exactly what that what you want,ep072
1581,the kitchen was it was just really weird,ep072
1584,that that master bedroom he was right,ep072
1587,beside the kitchen and it didn't have a,ep072
1590,bathroom attached to us or even closer,ep072
1593,yeah,ep072
1596,[Music],ep072
1599,[Music],ep072
1602,let's narrow it down to two,ep072
1605,yeah big white house with a pool that's,ep072
1608,$300 over our budget,ep072
1611,I think we'll be the first one that I'd,ep072
1614,say no to all right okay try go for a,ep072
1617,walk on the beach go watch the sunset,ep072
1620,I think that's a great idea muchas,ep072
1623,gracias you can see both want a lawyer,ep072
1626,each speaking of discipline Ohio Beach,ep072
1629,which weren't doing a live one I want to,ep072
1632,live in las penitas that's why we came,ep072
1635,here,ep072
1638,that's the beach we were looking for,ep072
1641,that's true the lejos is pretty amazing,ep072
1644,they had that very secluded master area,ep072
1647,yeah master I do want four bedrooms but,ep072
1650,the big yellow colonial yeah it's too,ep072
1653,far away from the restaurants too far,ep072
1656,away from the bars and we're not gonna,ep072
1659,have the foot traffic about the clients,ep072
1662,I think we need but I really like kind,ep072
1665,of the layout of the house and like the,ep072
1668,old colonial style feels like a little,ep072
1671,jungle,ep072
1674,so much shade I really like that house,ep072
1677,but the master doesn't even have a,ep072
1680,bathroom anywhere close to it,ep072
1683,I absolutely love the ocean last year's,ep072
1686,really think it's not too much work to,ep072
1689,fix it up and make it nice enough,ep072
1692,I can definitely do it would be fun to,ep072
1695,work on another project together I think,ep072

156,place here in South Tampa but house,ep073
159,hunting is never easy for these polar,ep073
162,opposites but it's what works this one,ep073
165,might be worth the look I am attracted,ep073
168,to the bungalow styles I really like the,ep073
171,sort of vintage she feel very cozy,ep073
174,lots of character that's more my style,ep073
177,of the Mediterranean I do want the,ep073
180,larger Mediterranean style the tiled,ep073
183,roofs the terra cotta that to me says,ep073
186,florida I also like newer properties,ep073
189,because I want to have as little,ep073
192,renovation as possible but CeCe's,ep073
195,looking for a home she can put her,ep073
198,personal stamp on I love to renovate,ep073
201,it's my thing I do have a vision for it,ep073
204,I want to not be worried about coming,ep073
207,home on a Friday afternoon,ep073
210,and ripping out cabinets this one looks,ep073
213,like it costs too much our budget is a,ep073
216,wide range because she wants to renovate,ep073
219,and I wanna buy something that's move-in,ep073
222,ready so we probably do not want to go,ep073
225,"above $700,000 I would feel more",ep073
228,comfortable not going above 600 I would,ep073
231,like to stay in the fours with a 5,ep073
234,[Music],ep073
237,square feet I wouldn't make it out of,ep073
240,the car I would also like a smaller,ep073
243,house I don't really want to go above,ep073
246,"3,000 square feet",ep073
249,I would like to enjoy the low,ep073
252,maintenance lifestyle we've always had,ep073
255,"houses more than 3,300 Square feet ish",ep073
258,I'm not at a point that I want to,ep073
261,downsize our lives we need space I want,ep073
264,hardwood floors or nice tile floors not,ep073
267,12 inch by 12 inch generic builder-grade,ep073
270,they both want an upgraded kitchen but,ep073
273,CeeCee insists it can't have a feature,ep073
276,she sees as a space waster slash clutter,ep073
279,collector I absolutely do not want an,ep073
282,island in the kitchen unless it's,ep073
285,functional with a cooktop or a sink or,ep073
288,something like that Stephen wants a,ep073
291,large master bedroom and they both agree,ep073
294,the master bath must be updated and look,ep073
297,there's a garage we like to bike we like,ep073
300,to rollerblade we're probably gonna get,ep073
303,a kayak or two we have to have someplace,ep073
306,to store our equipment Outback they're,ep073
309,looking for a screened-in porch or an,ep073
312,outdoor entertainment area that's known,ep073
315,as a lanai I know we're not necessarily,ep073
318,looking for a pool but that's nice it's,ep073
321,not our first time finding a house,ep073
324,together having done this multiple times,ep073
327,we know the pain points we know the,ep073
330,pressure points they get each of us,ep073
333,going if it's gonna be well at the end,ep073
336,of the day we always wind up doing,ep073
339,what's best for our family today they're,ep073
342,seeing a home their agent picked with,ep073
345,Steven in mind this house is a 4-bedroom,ep073
348,"3-bath 2,700 square feet how much is a",ep073
351,685 what all I see is a garage and a,ep073
354,huge price tag give it a chance it's a,ep073
357,Mediterranean like I wanted,ep073
360,a new build like I wanted I would not,ep073
363,choose this style in 100 years I would,ep073
366,never be attracted to this this would be,ep073
369,the last thing on my list completely,ep073
372,moving right I like that,ep073
375,well I hope it's renovated to my taste,ep073
378,because if not there's no room in the,ep073
381,budget to change it all right here we go,ep073
384,guys we're the garage right here on the,ep073
387,right-hand side when you walk in huh,ep073
390,very nice but you can see we've,ep073
393,open-concept living with the dining room,ep073
396,living room and kitchen right over here,ep073
399,and again everything is completely,ep073
402,remodeled and you do have an amazing,ep073
405,fireplace it is gasps yes very nice are,ep073
408,you seriously impressed by some tiles,ep073
411,that are just turned vertically I like,ep073
414,it better than just some original,ep073
417,structure yes okay I will give you this,ep073
420,I do like the open concept however that,ep073
423,living room has only one configuration,ep073
426,and once it's that way it's the only way,ep073
429,can ever be anyways the kitchen yes very,ep073
432,nice cabinetry it's beautiful kitchen,ep073
435,it's exactly what you were looking for,ep073
438,it is a functional island most people do,ep073
441,love islands I am NOT one of them,ep073
444,this one just overpowers the room and,ep073
447,serves no function other than to be a,ep073
450,dining table and I know my family it's,ep073
453,gonna be covered in stuff and backpacks,ep073
456,and books and paper and I'm going to go,ep073
459,crazy there's nothing wrong with this,ep073
462,kitchen,ep073
465,there's stainless steel appliances it's,ep073
468,beautiful cabinetry it would work Wow,ep073
471,great entertaining deck back here and,ep073
474,it's definitely low maintenance there is,ep073
477,no yard yeah any whatsoever huge,ep073
480,beautiful trees I mean I would never cut,ep073
483,them down but that also makes no chance,ep073
486,of putting on lanai and you can see some,ep073
489,neighbors very close doesn't give us the,ep073
492,privacy we were looking for yeah back,ep073
495,inside they see the downstairs full bath,ep073
498,Oh actually do like wow this marks yeah,ep073
501,this is great which leads to a guest,ep073
504,bedroom good-size nice high ceilings,ep073
507,yeah this would work fine for guests you,ep073
510,can see the hardwood floors are carried,ep073
513,in upstairs,ep073
516,they look laminate to me oh I stole,ep073
519,their nice,ep073
522,they're consistent so you have a full,ep073
525,bath right here Oh,ep073
528,one bedroom right here and another,ep073
531,bedroom over here so this is the master,ep073
534,suite,ep073
537,check out the space that's got tons of,ep073
540,light Wow I love it,ep073
543,it's great I love the floors I love the,ep073
546,double doors crown molding plenty of,ep073
549,room for our furniture there it's got a,ep073
552,lot of room oh what's matter nothing I,ep073
555,love every single thing this is exactly,ep073
558,what I would do if I had a bathroom with,ep073
561,no holds barred I love it very well done,ep073
564,it's gonna be hard to beat this bathroom,ep073
567,[Music],ep073
570,overall I think this house has it hits,ep073
573,all of my needs and wants it is the,ep073
576,Mediterranean that I asked Nick for the,ep073
579,square footage is a little bit less than,ep073
582,I expected but with the open concept it,ep073
585,feels bigger and it meets the,ep073
588,move-in-ready criteria that I'm looking,ep073
591,for yes there's some concerns with the,ep073
594,backyard and I could live with the,ep073
597,kitchen I know I complained about the,ep073
600,size of it,ep073
603,the bathrooms are pretty nice and,ep073
606,there's a lot of them but this is really,ep073
609,high on the budget and there's no room,ep073
612,for me to express myself or do any,ep073
615,design elements I want to do stuff I,ep073
618,love to decorate I have to express,ep073
621,myself as a designer that I'm not but I,ep073
624,still want to I need something a little,ep073
627,more personality something a little more,ep073
630,vintage something with a little bit more,ep073
633,character but character is open to,ep073
636,interpretation it's not a Mediterranean,ep073
639,it's not a bungalow I don't even know,ep073
642,what to call it,ep073
645,[Music],ep073
648,after years away Steven and CeCe are,ep073
651,excited to move back to Tampa and get,ep073
654,out of the short-term rental they're,ep073
657,living in while they're house-hunting,ep073
660,problem is buying a house here won't be,ep073
663,easy because these two have a hard time,ep073
666,agreeing on anything including the,ep073
669,budget killing me so far they've seen a,ep073
672,large Mediterranean perfect for Steven,ep073
675,ceci loved a master suite but the home,ep073
678,was pricey and since its move-in ready,ep073
681,there wasn't the opportunity for her to,ep073
684,give it her personal design stamp plus,ep073
687,it didn't have the charm she's looking,ep073
690,for so today they're seeing a charmer,ep073
693,that needs some work this is different I,ep073
696,don't see a two-car garage,ep073
699,there's no garage there's definitely,ep073
702,plenty of rooms park it's four bedrooms,ep073
705,"four baths just under 3,500 square feet",ep073
708,I really didn't want that much square,ep073
711,footage and it's not a Mediterranean and,ep073
714,it is definitely not your globe,ep073
717,I don't even know what to call it it's,ep073
720,the English Tudor 1920s so it's,ep073
723,definitely got the charm that you want,ep073
726,see see but it was completely remodeled,ep073
729,20 years ago as long as Steve and CC,ep073
732,have an open mind about the exterior of,ep073
735,the house I think they'll love the,ep073
738,"inside and how much is this 650,000 ohh",ep073
741,that's getting high for me all right,ep073
744,welcome guys,ep073
747,this door is so heavy this must be,ep073
750,original how beautiful this is a bit,ep073
753,dated,ep073
756,the floors all need to be sanded look at,ep073
759,the fireplace it's filthy look at the,ep073
762,work that needs to be done with it I,ep073
765,love this fireplace for its charm I mean,ep073
768,you can just paint this up brighten it,ep073
771,up you would not believe the amazing,ep073
774,focal piece I could put up there I can't,ep073
777,see easy I need to see finished I want,ep073
780,that walk-in ready I don't want to have,ep073
783,to do a lot if any renovations I see a,ep073
786,lot of work here behind the family room,ep073
789,is a bedroom suite that has a private,ep073
792,den all right over here we have the,ep073
795,dining room this is really huge wow this,ep073
798,is a big space I'm gonna need a much,ep073
801,bigger dining table what we have is,ep073
804,gonna be dwarfed in this room the high,ep073
807,ceilings is nice,ep073
810,did not expect to see a room a dining,ep073
813,room of this size and the business,ep073
816,Vantage of the house yeah there's tons,ep073
819,of light so you have light in this house,ep073
822,all right we have the kitchen over here,ep073
825,it does have the granite countertops and,ep073
828,stainless steel appliances this is not,ep073
831,updated and I builder-grade generic 12,ep073
834,inch by 12 inch tiles this has to be the,ep073
837,first thing to go,ep073
840,it's a livable kitchen for the immediate,ep073
843,future but we're gonna have to do,ep073
846,something some update yeah I see a lot,ep073
849,of features I see a lot of potential I,ep073
852,just don't want to wait for the money,ep073
855,tree to grow the money to do it all,ep073
858,right so we have a second living space,ep073
861,back here okay this is where I'm,ep073
864,starting to get a little nervous this is,ep073
867,not low-maintenance living this is a,ep073
870,really big house I was hoping to go at,ep073
873,least a thousand square feet smaller,ep073
876,this is my favorite room in the house so,ep073
879,far this is where we're gonna spend most,ep073
882,of our time together as a family so I,ep073
885,think it's great they see a downstairs,ep073
888,master suite that's really nice do we,ep073
891,have out of town guests then head,ep073
894,outside pool that's a great saltwater,ep073
897,heated pool as you can see there's a,ep073
900,covered lanai Nick I know I said I,ep073
903,wanted a low-maintenance yard I didn't,ep073
906,say I wanted no yard like there's not,ep073
909,even grass Wells's mulch and leaves,ep073
912,we weren't expecting a pool and having,ep073
915,that lanai is nice the only thing is it,ep073
918,takes up a lot of the yard I don't know,ep073
921,if I want to give up that yard for a,ep073
924,pool back inside they head upstairs we,ep073
927,have a great landing area up here we,ep073
930,have a great option for Bria right here,ep073
933,Oh cute angles to the ceiling and I love,ep073
936,that the bathroom is right there great,ep073
939,let's go ahead and check out the master,ep073
942,over here well first off you can see all,ep073
945,the natural light in here as well you,ep073
948,have a great bay window color is,ep073
951,terrible,ep073
954,yeah but we plantation shutters trace,ep073
957,tray ceilings plenty of room for our,ep073
960,furniture it's an easy sell for a master,ep073
963,so I know it's a little bit dated but,ep073
966,you have great space this makes me want,ep073
969,to scream cry this is not a quick easy,ep073
972,fix this is a huge undertaking I love,ep073
975,"the fact that it's over 3,400 square",ep073
978,feet I think I would like to shave like,ep073
981,a thousand square feet off of that and,ep073
984,besides this style Tudor is neither the,ep073
987,Mediterranean nor the bungalow still,ep073
990,doesn't have a garage we didn't really,ep073
993,have aspirations for a pool and this is,ep073
996,at the top of my personal comfort level,ep073
999,on a price point I know that I can do,ep073
1002,beautiful things of this house the,ep073
1005,uniqueness of it gives it a character,ep073
1008,and a charm that price scares me since,ep073
1011,Cece wants both a less expensive,ep073
1014,property and a bungalow her agents come,ep073
1017,"through on both counts it's 539,000",ep073
1020,but that sauce that's good price,ep073
1023,[Music],ep073
1026,thank any cast it we can try,ep073
1029,Stephen and CeCe have up to a maximum of,ep073
1032,"$700,000 to buy a home in South Tampa",ep073
1035,remember nice and slow they've seen a,ep073
1038,larger move-in-ready Mediterranean,ep073
1041,perfect for Steven CeCe loved the master,ep073
1044,suite especially the bathroom but the,ep073
1047,home was near the top of their max,ep073
1050,budget and it didn't have the quirky,ep073
1053,character and Renault potential she,ep073
1056,wants they've also seen a character home,ep073
1059,that needed some work,ep073
1062,just what Cece is looking for but,ep073
1065,neither of them were wowed by the pool,ep073
1068,or the Tudor style and updating the,ep073
1071,kitchen and master bath would bust the,ep073
1074,budget so now their agents lined up a,ep073
1077,well-priced bungalow for Cece so,ep073
1080,adorable tell me there's a garage,ep073
1083,there's no garage okay 15:44 square feet,ep073
1086,it's pretty tight 2-bedroom 1-bath that,ep073
1089,in the whole house has a guesthouse out,ep073
1092,back there I think you guys are really,ep073
1095,gonna like and there's plenty of,ep073
1098,opportunity to expand band which is what,ep073
1101,you wanted to do Cece all right check,ep073
1104,out this great open floor plan I love it,ep073
1107,I love the floors their original,ep073
1110,obviously the square footage actually I,ep073
1113,wasn't expecting this big of a space and,ep073
1116,this fireplace is great with the,ep073
1119,built-ins tell me you love this the,ep073
1122,built-ins are nice we could definitely,ep073
1125,deal with that they see the dining room,ep073
1128,on the way to one of the homes special,ep073
1131,features here we have a great wine,ep073
1134,around it's also your everyday entry,ep073
1137,point to the house so I don't think we,ep073
1140,need a wine room because every rooms of,ep073
1143,wine room with me you try hard enough we,ep073
1146,don't need this room it could be a,ep073
1149,bathroom beyond the dining room is a den,ep073
1152,that leads to the kitchen the kitchen's,ep073
1155,been completely updated inside yeah it's,ep073
1158,really nice all the appliances are like,ep073
1161,the kitchen is nice but it is tiny,ep073
1164,remember the budget allows for some,ep073
1167,additions and some improvements in the,ep073
1170,property to do that would automatically,ep073
1173,put us in the top end of our budget I,ep073
1176,would rather have a house that has the,ep073
1179,square footage already rather than,ep073
1182,making complete sweeping changes okay a,ep073
1185,great outdoor space,ep073
1188,looks a little bit small okay now it's,ep073
1191,perfect just put a screened-in area and,ep073
1194,it'll join with the house and be a huge,ep073
1197,entertaining space it's great it's,ep073
1200,private I don't see how it would work,ep073
1203,and we have a great guest house back,ep073
1206,there one bedroom wonderful bath I'm,ep073
1209,sorry there's just too much work to be,ep073
1212,done from the size you've got to just,ep073
1215,give it a chance,ep073
1218,this is so cute no I love this I mean if,ep073
1221,people come visit us we don't want to,ep073
1224,try to put them up in like a grand,ep073
1227,estate when they come to Florida they,ep073
1230,want to feel like they're at the beach,ep073
1233,this look a little beach house people,ep073
1236,pay money for this the guest house also,ep073
1239,has a bathroom and bonus living space,ep073
1242,it's wasted space that should be in the,ep073
1245,house because it's not connected to the,ep073
1248,house we just won't use it I would use,ep073
1251,it for now as a guest bedroom and then,ep073
1254,eventually Bria can go back there when,ep073
1257,she's a little bit older back inside,ep073
1260,they check out the bedrooms this is the,ep073
1263,second bedroom okay guys there's,ep073
1266,definitely a little larger a little I,ep073
1269,hope a lot all right let's go take a,ep073
1272,look at the bathroom,ep073
1275,Oh white marble countertops are beaming,ep073
1278,course the only way it is it is but,ep073
1281,remember there's still room to expand on,ep073
1284,the house just don't look at the master,ep073
1287,again you have the original floors,ep073
1290,throughout the house which is nice I,ep073
1293,like that you know tons of light this,ep073
1296,would fit a king-size bed,ep073
1299,nicely done it would fit a king-size bed,ep073
1302,that's about it it's just not enough,ep073
1305,it's enough for me this is a very,ep073
1308,manageable house it's got everything we,ep073
1311,need,ep073
1314,this is livable he thinks that square,ep073
1317,footage equates comfort and I don't,ep073
1320,think that's true,ep073
1323,so what do you guys think I love it,ep073
1326,perfect I'm actually kind of surprised,ep073
1329,in how much I like the charm it does,ep073
1332,have a good flow to it and the front,ep073
1335,porch is gorgeous but I don't like is,ep073
1338,the size of the house we're a family of,ep073
1341,three this is a very easy to maintain,ep073
1344,and inexpensive to maintain one bathroom,ep073
1347,one vanity one tub shower so maybe,ep073
1350,twenty thousand dollars to put a,ep073
1353,bathroom over there there's a lot to,ep073
1356,talk about after deciding between size,ep073
1359,style and move in readiness Stephen and,ep073
1362,CeCe still have to discuss the kitchen,ep073
1365,master bedroom and budget I am so ready,ep073
1368,[Music],ep073
1371,but half MLS am so ready to do this Cece,ep073
1374,"and Stephen have up to $700,000 to buy a",ep073
1377,home in Tampa Florida after seeing,ep073
1380,several options it's decision time okay,ep073
1383,so the Mediterranean saw that you liked,ep073
1386,for six hundred and eighty five thousand,ep073
1389,dollars it is the style I'm looking for,ep073
1392,it has the garage and remember the,ep073
1395,master bath yeah the master bath was,ep073
1398,great that kitchen really overpowered,ep073
1401,the entire first floor and it's at the,ep073
1404,top of my price point and that back yard,ep073
1407,yard is a mess do you want to talk about,ep073
1410,the tutor for 650,ep073
1413,yeah it's 3300 square feet which meets,ep073
1416,my expectations but also it gives you,ep073
1419,the charm there is literally no yard but,ep073
1422,what yard there is is taken up by a nice,ep073
1425,pool it's a little too big it's a little,ep073
1428,too expensive and every single room,ep073
1431,needs work but it's charming it's,ep073
1434,adorable doesn't have a garage,ep073
1437,below with an additional one bedroom one,ep073
1440,back guesthouse it's move-in-ready I,ep073
1443,like the size the curb appeal is,ep073
1446,charming for five hundred and thirty,ep073
1449,nine thousand dollars I really like this,ep073
1452,one a lot it's your style but the,ep073
1455,bedrooms are tiny,ep073
1458,it says three-bedroom two-bath it's,ep073
1461,really two bedroom one bath in the main,ep073
1464,house I love the house it's great it's,ep073
1467,but the problem is it's too small,ep073
1470,at this price point I think adding up,ep073
1473,screened-in porch add a second bathroom,ep073
1476,a little bit down the road again no,ep073
1479,garage so if we had to eliminate one I,ep073
1482,would use each other,ep073
1485,so you don't like the Mediterranean I,ep073
1488,don't like the bungalow should we take a,ep073
1491,closer look at this Tudor I think it's a,ep073
1494,good compromise it's charming and,ep073
1497,adorable but I don't know if we can get,ep073
1500,a little bit back you can make the,ep073
1503,changes that you want okay,ep073
1506,let's make an offer okay yeah let's do a,ep073
1509,solid started we've been here about two,ep073
1512,weeks,ep073
1515,avocado in the salad - yeah was listed,ep073
1518,for 650 and we offer them 640 and they,ep073
1521,took our 640 so yeah there's definitely,ep073
1524,room in the budget to make some major,ep073
1527,improvements as soon as I put this in,ep073
1530,here I'm gonna need you to water it in,ep073
1533,at first I wasn't really sure what was,ep073
1536,going on style-wise I've never heard of,ep073
1539,a Tudor but it does have a certain,ep073
1542,appeal to it because it is unique I get,ep073
1545,what I want,ep073
1548,size-wise but she also gets her,ep073
1551,quaintness and her historical value of I,ep073
1554,just wish it wasn't so big the entire,ep073
1557,East Wing of the house will never see,ep073
1560,the light of day except for the fact,ep073
1563,that we already moved in and you're,ep073
1566,already looking for places to put stuff,ep073
1569,too much stuff,ep073
1572,right honey I was ready for the tub one,ep073
1575,of the first things I had to do was make,ep073
1578,that master bathroom palatable ready Oh,ep073
1581,beautiful changing out the light,ep073
1584,fixtures really brightened it up,ep073
1587,painting the walls and I did a faux,ep073
1590,finish on the countertops and changed,ep073
1593,out some knobs to something a little,ep073
1596,more glamorous and I think it's gonna,ep073
1599,work for a little while until we can,ep073
1602,really take down to the studs and make,ep073
1605,it beautiful we don't get the garage,ep073
1608,here but it's something that we can,ep073
1611,always add,ep073
1614,to add one and eventually we also are,ep073
1617,gonna do some changes to the kitchen,ep073
1620,I thought about replacing and just,ep073
1623,ripping it out but I really think that,ep073
1626,they're good cabinets and I think,ep073
1629,painting them white and then new,ep073
1632,countertops new counters would really,ep073
1635,make a difference and of course that,ep073
1638,floor that is every weekend now is spent,ep073
1641,talking about color schemes furniture,ep073
1644,what we're gonna change oh stop it it's,ep073
1647,not that bad it's exaggerating,ep073
12,[Music],ep074
15,Steve's career moved to Melbourne,ep074
18,Australia is a huge game-changer for,ep074
21,Michelle I wouldn't really describe,ep074
24,myself as a risk-taker everything that,ep074
27,can kill you is in Australia sorry I,ep074
30,really have a thing about birds,ep074
33,this move is about me but she's only,ep074
36,asking for one thing in return my number,ep074
39,one goal is to live on the beach,ep074
42,the real estate market in Melbourne at,ep074
45,the moment is very tight and the closer,ep074
48,we are to the beach the more rent,ep074
51,they're gonna pay when you're the chief,ep074
54,financial officer of the company you,ep074
57,need to stay inside your budget I think,ep074
60,that we can maybe increase it a little,ep074
63,bit this aim really is very type-a by,ep074
66,the book you try to get me to run the,ep074
69,dishwasher less,ep074
72,[Music],ep074
75,you ready yes I recently accepted a,ep074
78,position to be the chief financial,ep074
81,officer of a multinational automotive,ep074
84,company what do you think we might see,ep074
87,Babbitt she first mentioned Australia I,ep074
90,said sure because I've been having kind,ep074
93,of a bad day the idea of getting far,ep074
96,away sounded appealing look at all those,ep074
99,buildings but I've never been somewhere,ep074
102,where I didn't know anybody and as we,ep074
105,were packing up I thought maybe we,ep074
108,should just stay in Nashville the city,ep074
111,looks a lot bigger than I was,ep074
114,anticipating a little nervous about,ep074
117,being by myself how will I spend my day,ep074
120,when Avery is in school so Avery what,ep074
123,are you most excited about living in,ep074
126,Australia going to the beach I know what,ep074
129,the number-one priority is for Michelle,ep074
132,and for Avery - it's the beach I think,ep074
135,the office is that way but I'm as cheap,ep074
138,as they come and the budget comes to the,ep074
141,top of the pile it looks like it's going,ep074
144,opposite to the beach we have no idea,ep074
147,what to expect we don't know the areas,ep074
150,we don't know the suburbs I'd like to,ep074
153,think that we have a strategy but we're,ep074
156,winging it and for us winging it doesn't,ep074
159,usually fall in the plan Melbourne is in,ep074
162,the southeastern state of Victoria,ep074
165,Australia the city is known for its,ep074
168,beautiful beaches easy lifestyle and,ep074
171,unpredictable weather which can be,ep074
174,summed up by the phrase four seasons in,ep074
177,one day Melvin is a very multicultural,ep074
180,city it's been voted the world's most,ep074
183,livable city and three is in a row the,ep074
186,real estate market of Melbourne at the,ep074
189,moment is very tight properties are not,ep074
192,lasting long at all on the market we'd,ep074
195,like to have at least three bedrooms at,ep074
198,least two bathrooms I'm gonna be working,ep074
201,out in Dandenong and so finding a place,ep074
204,that's in the south eastern suburbs is,ep074
207,gonna be important to me thanks to me,ep074
210,about moving to Australia is being close,ep074
213,to the beach,ep074
216,our daughter especially has not stopped,ep074
219,talking about the beach so if we could,ep074
222,actually walk to the beach that would be,ep074
225,great,ep074
228,and Nashville will usually make it to,ep074
231,the beach once a year it's about a 10,ep074
234,hour drive and that was the big selling,ep074
237,point to both Avery and I to come to,ep074
240,Australia we would love to have a pool,ep074
243,I would love to have a place with,ep074
246,character Steve and I disagree on the,ep074
249,type of houses that we lie,ep074
252,I prefer newer modern but living in,ep074
255,Nashville we had a fairly new house and,ep074
258,the most important question I guess is,ep074
261,what sort of budget are we looking at,ep074
264,"our corporate budget is $5,000 a month",ep074
267,okay,ep074
270,I think that we can maybe increase it a,ep074
273,little bit don't worry we use it all up,ep074
276,that's for sure there's a great influx,ep074
279,of people relocating to Melbourne,ep074
282,things are getting snapped up very,ep074
285,quickly so it's gonna be really hard to,ep074
288,find Steve and Michelle a home within,ep074
291,walking distance in the beach and within,ep074
294,budget,ep074
297,so Williams towns located over the West,ep074
300,Gate Bridge and is it near the beach,ep074
303,Williamstown is a beach town Beach,ep074
306,fantastic and like anywhere in the world,ep074
309,the closer we are to the beach the more,ep074
312,rent we're gonna pay it'd be interesting,ep074
315,to see the dynamic between the two of,ep074
318,them and who gets to choose location,ep074
321,that was a long drive yeah it's probably,ep074
324,about an hour to work but is that the,ep074
327,beach right there yep right there Wow,ep074
330,it's a three-story townhome it's four,ep074
333,bedrooms three bathrooms pool but talk,ep074
336,to me about price it's slightly over,ep074
339,budget at six thousand a month 20% over,ep074
342,it's not small amount over its,ep074
345,considerably over budget so here we are,ep074
348,on the ground level,ep074
351,hold the bedrooms are located down here,ep074
354,except for the master bedroom,ep074
357,wow this is really nice it looks like a,ep074
360,fancy hotel suite I love the furniture I,ep074
363,love the wallpaper I don't know if it's,ep074
366,the right room for Avery being so close,ep074
369,to the front door it even has its own,ep074
372,ensuite which would be really nice for,ep074
375,Avery to have it's very contemporary I,ep074
378,really like it,ep074
381,I know Michelle likes newer homes maybe,ep074
384,that's her neat-freak,ep074
387,coming out but I do love older homes,ep074
390,this is the Knicks pitcher the current,ep074
393,tenants using it as a study or it could,ep074
396,be a bedroom and can you actually see,ep074
399,the pool from here yeah we can oh that's,ep074
402,fantastic,ep074
405,Wow this is a great pool good size this,ep074
408,is a really great pool he loves to swim,ep074
411,so she would be all about this there's a,ep074
414,great hot tub for you if you're,ep074
417,stressful job come in after work relax a,ep074
420,little bit all right,ep074
423,oh wow this is really nice,ep074
426,has the dining kitchen living room,ep074
429,combination all together so this is an,ep074
432,electric stove yes oh that's nice,ep074
435,actually that's what I'm used to from,ep074
438,the states and that used to all the gas,ep074
441,and then this balcony can I actually see,ep074
444,the beach from there you can see the,ep074
447,beach from there but the view is even,ep074
450,better for the master bedroom balcony,ep074
453,and this has to be one of the biggest,ep074
456,master suites in Melbourne wow it's huge,ep074
459,just for you look at this dressing area,ep074
462,it's fantastic it has a nice tool to,ep074
465,help me get ready and its private too so,ep074
468,when I'm getting dressed to have my own,ep074
471,little area I'm getting the feeling that,ep074
474,you're falling in love with this house,ep074
477,this property is everything I'm looking,ep074
480,for and more I've exceeded my,ep074
483,expectations,ep074
486,take a look at this view oh wow I always,ep074
489,wanted to be able to watch the water but,ep074
492,I never thought I'd actually be able to,ep074
495,see it from our balcony every day I can,ep074
498,see how this is everything Michele is,ep074
501,really looking for but let's talk about,ep074
504,the budget a little bit spending that,ep074
507,thousand dollars a month is just more,ep074
510,than I had anticipated,ep074
513,it's an hour commute and can you explain,ep074
516,what's going on with the park the,ep074
519,resurfacing at the moment but that'll be,ep074
522,all nice and green and a couple of weeks,ep074
525,time when you move in,ep074
528,she said when wait exactly,ep074
531,Elijah gets Steve closer to work,ep074
534,I've got 35 minute commute but there's a,ep074
537,problem the house is $200 over the,ep074
540,budget and seems a little small but this,ep074
543,is actually twice the size of a lot of,ep074
546,the homes around here really Wow,ep074
549,steve has the opportunity of a lifetime,ep074
552,in Melbourne I recently accepted a,ep074
555,position to be the chief financial,ep074
558,officer of a multinational automotive,ep074
561,company but needs to uproot the entire,ep074
564,family to make it happen I stayed there,ep074
567,my whole life I didn't travel very much,ep074
570,and I recently just took my first,ep074
573,executive level position which was a,ep074
576,really big deal and we're moving across,ep074
579,the world so this is called a ditch redo,ep074
582,it's the oldest winning swim in the,ep074
585,world we sold our house and we're just,ep074
588,winging it and for two people that our,ep074
591,accountant tight people wing in it,ep074
594,doesn't usually fall in the plan,ep074
597,[Music],ep074
600,Steve's very type-a by the book we read,ep074
603,all the instructions we go step by step,ep074
606,when you're the chief financial officer,ep074
609,of the company you need to stay inside,ep074
612,your budget but michelle is giving up a,ep074
615,comfortable life in tennessee and in,ep074
618,exchange expect Steve to pay for the one,ep074
621,thing she's never had I always wanted to,ep074
624,be able to watch the water but I never,ep074
627,thought I'd actually be able to see it,ep074
630,from our balcony every day in Nashville,ep074
633,it's about a 10 hour drive and that was,ep074
636,the big selling point to both Avery and,ep074
639,I to come to Australia was to be close,ep074
642,to the beach but you know I don't want,ep074
645,an extremely long commute yeah it's,ep074
648,probably about an hour to work and it's,ep074
651,slightly over budget at six thousand a,ep074
654,month real estate market of Melbourne at,ep074
657,the moment is very tight properties are,ep074
660,not lasting long at all on the market so,ep074
663,this is a typical area Ryder there's,ep074
666,lots of tree-lined streets lots of,ep074
669,shopping all within walking distance,ep074
672,fantastic so it's gonna be really hard,ep074
675,to find Steve and Michelle a home within,ep074
678,walking distance of the beach,ep074
681,anything budget but Melbourne has very,ep074
684,changeable weather I'm not really sure,ep074
687,how often you'd even want to go to the,ep074
690,beach over here how long is the commute,ep074
693,for me,ep074
696,I've got thirty five minute commute to,ep074
699,your work okay that's not bad,ep074
702,Elijah's up against a long list of,ep074
705,must-haves from both sides of the,ep074
708,equation and a surprisingly limited,ep074
711,"inventory for Steve's $5,000 monthly",ep074
714,budget this home is a great mix of old,ep074
717,and new it does have the period features,ep074
720,for Steve but it is fairly modern on the,ep074
723,inside this house is called Daphne it's,ep074
726,over 100 years old we're about 10,ep074
729,minutes away from the beach and only two,ep074
732,blocks away from the shops which is,ep074
735,fantastic good there's properties three,ep074
738,bedrooms two bathrooms and the price,ep074
741,"it's 5,200 dollars a month",ep074
744,okay Wow you can say it's got some,ep074
747,beautiful period features some high,ep074
750,ceilings lovely light fittings and,ep074
753,polish floorboards throughout the Hawaii,ep074
756,Deathlands like a home that you would,ep074
759,love he loves the more historic homes,ep074
762,this looks like a good start,ep074
765,historic homes aren't really my thing as,ep074
768,much as they are sees it on it looks a,ep074
771,little small just to your left is the,ep074
774,double bedroom well there's a lot of,ep074
777,natural light in this room yeah there,ep074
780,really is I could see Avery in here I,ep074
783,think we could really make this hers,ep074
786,let's take a look at the master with,ep074
789,ensuite across the hole okay great great,ep074
792,it's got more period features in here a,ep074
795,little compact for me this is actually,ep074
798,quite a large bedroom for a Victorian,ep074
801,home I never shared sinks before yeah,ep074
804,that'll be a new challenge for us,ep074
807,there's lots of options for this room,ep074
810,could be a bedroom could be a,ep074
813,area maybe so this is the kitchen living,ep074
816,and dining area this is quite modern for,ep074
819,such a historic home yeah it's been,ep074
822,fully renovated and it's got a stainless,ep074
825,steel appliances I really like this Big,ep074
828,Island 2 is a great workspace every and,ep074
831,I like to bake with each other we have,ep074
834,our little matching apron so it might be,ep074
837,able to make it work so this is the,ep074
840,outdoor entertaining area okay seems a,ep074
843,little small wow this is actually big,ep074
846,for Melbourne and Brighton area so this,ep074
849,is actually a probably twice the size of,ep074
852,a lot of the homes around here really,ep074
855,Wow,ep074
858,it's close to the beach I mean I would,ep074
861,love to be on the beach but it's pretty,ep074
864,close now wouldn't really love to have a,ep074
867,pool compared to what else is out there,ep074
870,I think it's a really great deal the,ep074
873,house rent is $200 over the budget that,ep074
876,may not seem like a big difference but I,ep074
879,really want to stay disciplined inside,ep074
882,the budget Elisha finally gets Steve,ep074
885,"under budget I do like that at $4,800 a",ep074
888,month,ep074
891,I think these properties gonna be a real,ep074
894,contender but sacrifices the one thing,ep074
897,Michelle's been after from the get-go it,ep074
900,is a bit further away from the beach,ep074
903,couldn't walk you'd have to drive I,ep074
906,would be very disappointed to have come,ep074
909,all the way from Nashville to Australia,ep074
912,and still have to get in the car to go,ep074
915,to the beach,ep074
918,it's the oldest living culture in the,ep074
921,world so these stories have been handed,ep074
924,down for a thousands of years,ep074
927,it's Beach versus budget as Steve and,ep074
930,Michelle get the hang of Melbourne,ep074
933,Australia a few weeks ago I got a phone,ep074
936,call hey Steve would you be willing to,ep074
939,consider an opportunity in Melbourne,ep074
942,Australia this represents water is,ep074
945,without the water when I think we must,ep074
948,protect the water I've always had a very,ep074
951,exciting career in tax which most people,ep074
954,yawn baby people laughing make people,ep074
957,yawn as soon as we say it and I recently,ep074
960,just took my first executive level,ep074
963,position and we're moving across the,ep074
966,world I don't know if I'll even be able,ep074
969,to work there you've done a story about,ep074
972,the journey from America here to our to,ep074
975,our country becoming a stay-at-home mom,ep074
978,I think is scary for her so I want to,ep074
981,make sure it's a house that Michelle and,ep074
984,Avery will be comfortable in ready to go,ep074
987,get some treat caught in the reshuffling,ep074
990,of their already hectic lives Michelle,ep074
993,and Avery find a tantalizing opportunity,ep074
996,and Nashville will usually make it to,ep074
999,the beach once a year it's about a,ep074
1002,10-hour Drive and that was the big,ep074
1005,selling point to both Avery and I to,ep074
1008,come to Australia was to be close to the,ep074
1011,beach but I'm as cheap as they come and,ep074
1014,we really need to make sure we keep the,ep074
1017,budget in control house one puts the,ep074
1020,beach front and center I always wanted,ep074
1023,to be able to watch the water but I,ep074
1026,never thought I'd actually be able to,ep074
1029,see it from our balcony every day but,ep074
1032,drastically affects Steve's bottom line,ep074
1035,"our corporate budget is $5,000 a month",ep074
1038,don't worry we use it a lot that's for,ep074
1041,sure huh it's slightly over budget at,ep074
1044,six thousand a month and it's an hour,ep074
1047,commute for me,ep074
1050,I'd like to see my family while we're in,ep074
1053,Australia but it is on the beach house,ep074
1056,two is the perfect compromise on,ep074
1059,location we're about ten minutes away,ep074
1062,from the beach and hug that 35 minute,ep074
1065,commute to work,ep074
1068,okay that's not bad but Michelle worries,ep074
1071,that Avery won't have the space she,ep074
1074,needs a little compact I would really,ep074
1077,love to have a pool and the house is,ep074
1080,$200 over the budget that may not seem,ep074
1083,like a big difference but I really want,ep074
1086,to stay inside the budget the rental,ep074
1089,market is tight and volatile there's a,ep074
1092,great influx of people relocating to,ep074
1095,Melbourne,ep074
1098,things are getting snapped up very,ep074
1101,quickly though despite,ep074
1104,turn over Elijah is able to find a place,ep074
1107,in a desirable family friendly,ep074
1110,neighborhood so broader has typically,ep074
1113,but of heritage Victorian era homes it's,ep074
1116,very expensive most of the homes around,ep074
1119,here and multi-million dollars but the,ep074
1122,beach can't be the priority if Steve,ep074
1125,wants to stay close to work and under,ep074
1128,budget at 4900 dollars a month I think,ep074
1131,this property is gonna be a real,ep074
1134,contender so this is the big front,ep074
1137,garden it's very lovely,ep074
1140,he's on a rather busy street though and,ep074
1143,I'm just worried about Avery playing so,ep074
1146,close to a busy street it is a bit,ep074
1149,further away from the beach as well,ep074
1152,about how long ago walk would it be,ep074
1155,could walk you'd have to drive I would,ep074
1158,be very disappointed to have come all,ep074
1161,the way from Nashville to Australia and,ep074
1164,still have to get in the car to go to,ep074
1167,the beach this property is four bedrooms,ep074
1170,two bathrooms and it has a pool it's not,ep074
1173,bad and how long of a commute would it,ep074
1176,be it's half an hour commute so it's,ep074
1179,actually quite quite good this property,ep074
1182,is under budget stay at 4800 a month I,ep074
1185,like it this is the period featured,ep074
1188,hallway this is a really nice entryway,ep074
1191,good this Sun really comes through this,ep074
1194,nicely I think as soon as Steve hurt,ep074
1197,under budget he was instantly in love,ep074
1200,let's start in the master bedroom okay,ep074
1203,well those are nice built-ins it looks,ep074
1206,like it should be big enough we've,ep074
1209,always had our own separate walk-in,ep074
1212,closet so it's gonna take some getting,ep074
1215,used to I think so this is just for,ep074
1218,shelves you can feel that I could,ep074
1221,imagine okay it's a little small it is,ep074
1224,small but I think it's a very adequate,ep074
1227,space some bookshelves so I think it,ep074
1230,could work,ep074
1233,oh wow this is a really nice big open,ep074
1236,space yeah it really is I love this oh,ep074
1239,and look at all the burners and it's,ep074
1242,nice and big I like that,ep074
1245,well I shall you know that deer head,ep074
1248,would be real if we were still in,ep074
1251,Nashville really Wow I'm glad it's not,ep074
1254,actually,ep074
1257,I thought the house itself was great the,ep074
1260,interior was great I love the kitchen,ep074
1263,let's be honest this isn't that exciting,ep074
1266,let's go see the pool let's go see the,ep074
1269,hole all right this is a little smaller,ep074
1272,than I think I was anticipating put a,ep074
1275,plunge pool it's just enough to climb in,ep074
1278,there and cool down I think it was,ep074
1281,almost the size of our master bath in,ep074
1284,Nashville I'm not sure all three of us,ep074
1287,could get in at one time for me it's a,ep074
1290,great commute it won't be bad and it is,ep074
1293,under budget at 4800 a month I do like,ep074
1296,that it's just I was really hoping to be,ep074
1299,able to walk to the beach and walk to,ep074
1302,the shops I really like the house but,ep074
1305,for Michelle coming to Australia it's,ep074
1308,gonna be a challenge for her so I really,ep074
1311,want to make sure that we find something,ep074
1314,that really does check all the boxes for,ep074
1317,Michelle the reality is it comes down to,ep074
1320,two things price and location price is,ep074
1323,great location is great for me but it's,ep074
1326,not great for Michelle the ocean view,ep074
1329,house I really love that house it's just,ep074
1332,too bad that it is extremely over-budget,ep074
1335,so a couple months back would you have,ep074
1338,envisioned us being here no I would not,ep074
1341,have Steve wants to make the transition,ep074
1344,to Melbourne smooth and easy I know what,ep074
1347,the number-one priority is it's the,ep074
1350,beach very exciting yes but Michelle is,ep074
1353,already having a hard time with the,ep074
1356,adjustment I've never been somewhere,ep074
1359,where I didn't know anybody and I,ep074
1362,wouldn't really describe myself as a,ep074
1365,risk taker,ep074
1368,the oceanview house I really loved that,ep074
1371,house,ep074
1374,I always wanted to be able to watch the,ep074
1377,water but I never thought I'd actually,ep074
1380,be able to see it from our balcony every,ep074
1383,day,ep074
1386,look at this dressing area it's,ep074
1389,fantastic and only six thousand dollars,ep074
1392,a month she dreams of their new life,ep074
1395,near the beach but Steve's hard line on,ep074
1398,the budget could be a deal-breaker,ep074
1401,it's an hour commute for me I'd like to,ep074
1404,see my family while we're in Australia,ep074
1407,we got the Victorian house we're about,ep074
1410,ten minutes away from the beach and only,ep074
1413,two blocks away from the shops which is,ep074
1416,fantastic and I'd have the shorter,ep074
1419,commute house 2 comes up short on space,ep074
1422,for Michelle and Avery a little compact,ep074
1425,for me I think every might be a little,ep074
1428,sad that there's not a bigger playroom,ep074
1431,and the garden in the back seems a,ep074
1434,little small this is twice the size of a,ep074
1437,lot of the homes around here Wow and it,ep074
1440,still is a little over budget,ep074
1443,"steve is blinded by the price 4,800",ep074
1446,about me I like it this is a really nice,ep074
1449,entryway,ep074
1452,as soon as Steve hurt under budget he,ep074
1455,was instantly in love and gets an easy,ep074
1458,commute in under budget house 3 but I,ep074
1461,would have to drive to the beach drive,ep074
1464,to the shops I'm just not sure that one,ep074
1467,really works for me location wise,ep074
1470,[Music],ep074
1473,I think if I could eliminate any of them,ep074
1476,right now if I probably have to be the,ep074
1479,plunge pool house yeah I'd have to say,ep074
1482,the plunge pool house would be out for,ep074
1485,me too,ep074
1488,it was a nice house it just the location,ep074
1491,didn't quite work for me yes two more,ep074
1494,the Victorian house in the Ocean View,ep074
1497,house when we were talking about moving,ep074
1500,to Australia what really was telling me,ep074
1503,was being so close to the water and at,ep074
1506,the ocean view house we could actually,ep074
1509,see it from not one but two balconies,ep074
1512,every single day it's just too bad that,ep074
1515,it is an hour each way two hours,ep074
1518,round-trip an extremely over-budget but,ep074
1521,we can have a nice pool for Avery the,ep074
1524,master suite was unbelievable,ep074
1527,when I think about the Victorian house,ep074
1530,the commute is much better it's got a,ep074
1533,great claria for Avery in the backyard,ep074
1536,had many of the same features as the,ep074
1539,waterfront house that is true that's,ep074
1542,definitely a smaller house and it was,ep074
1545,still over our budget but it's over by a,ep074
1548,lot less I just want to make sure that,ep074
1551,you pick the house that's gonna make you,ep074
1554,happy,ep074
1557,I really did like that house I can't see,ep074
1560,the ocean from the house but I can walk,ep074
1563,to the ocean and I can watch to the,ep074
1566,shops which was really nice so I think I,ep074
1569,could live with them Victorian house all,ep074
1572,right let's go,ep074
1575,you ready to go to the beach thank you,ep074
1578,ready we watch to the beach at least,ep074
1581,once a week sometimes more when we were,ep074
1584,in Nashville this was a vacation now,ep074
1587,it's a Tuesday sometimes it's hard to,ep074
1590,believe that we're here it seems a bit,ep074
1593,surreal is it time to go first one Avery,ep074
1596,yeah Avery's been learning to snorkel,ep074
1599,she was really blossom she's more,ep074
1602,confident are you gonna clean all that,ep074
1605,up yeah he's gonna clean it up if you,ep074
1608,don't you we have fabulous neighbors,ep074
1611,Avery has a friend down the street she,ep074
1614,plays with all the time Emily there's a,ep074
1617,lot of rocks over here there are days,ep074
1620,that it starts bright and sunny and you,ep074
1623,end up with torrential rain okay you,ep074
1626,might want to go inside for a moment and,ep074
1629,we're gonna put some prawns on here in,ep074
1632,just a minute so I was really hesitant,ep074
1635,in the beginning about leaving the life,ep074
1638,that I knew but I'm not even sure what I,ep074
1641,was worried about anymore it seems like,ep074
1644,such a distant memory,ep074
1647,go-go-go,ep074
12,Wow st. Louis first-time buyer China is,ep075
15,all about the wow factor and a very,ep075
18,specific size master suite 1212 so,ep075
21,that's a little bit smaller than what we,ep075
24,needed yeah,ep075
27,husband Greg is looking for a finished,ep075
30,basement where he can record his podcast,ep075
33,welcome to the hyper report podcast,ep075
36,right and get out of my living room but,ep075
39,first they have to come to grips with,ep075
42,the limitations of a limited budget oh,ep075
45,this is not gonna work that this is not,ep075
48,a master bath this house was built in,ep075
51,1971 they didn't do master baths like,ep075
54,that,ep075
57,[Music],ep075
60,laughs I'll forgive me are you - every,ep075
63,kiss on the cheek my name is China and,ep075
66,I'm 27 and I am an IT project manager,ep075
69,for an aerospace company and I'm Greg,ep075
72,I'm 28 and I'm a systems analyst for,ep075
75,these same company so Greg and I met at,ep075
78,a local electronics store where he was,ep075
81,working at the time and we locked eyes,ep075
84,when he passed the aisle he you know,ep075
87,checking me when I checking you out like,ep075
90,that but check me out check my items out,ep075
93,and we change phone numbers and the rest,ep075
96,is history,ep075
99,there was a terrible ever since right,ep075
102,right so both of us grew up here in st.,ep075
105,Louis I think so this is an awesome,ep075
108,place to live just because there's so,ep075
111,many things to do,ep075
114,so we do like to go to the zoo the,ep075

135,the Central Western Area we live on the,ep075
138,third floor unfortunately there's no,ep075

147,trade their rental for their first home,ep075
150,we've been married for three years now,ep075

156,that next step so we are trying to you,ep075

183,take down some of those things off your,ep075
186,list we'll see okay 1487 it's a writer,ep075
189,on what we expect exactly they're hoping,ep075
192,to find a home in a family-friendly,ep075
195,suburb no more than 30 minutes outside,ep075
198,of the city so they can stay close to,ep075
201,work and family so I want to look at,ep075
204,some houses today I'm hoping you have,ep075
207,some,ep075

213,single family ranch-style home I would,ep075
216,love a ranch Rambler style home yeah,ep075

327,be just trying to cram all my words into,ep075
330,our budget and for me I would say the,ep075
333,most challenging would be cramming all,ep075

603,ranch with a big master suite and,ep075
606,finished basement but it's priced at the,ep075
609,top of their budget and is a little too,ep075
612,far from the city today they're seeing a,ep075
615,home that's in their target area less,ep075
618,than 30 minutes from the city well it'll,ep075
621,take this is an established neighborhood,ep075
624,that I'm not like who is that close,ep075
627,highway yeah I guess this is the house,ep075
630,right here brick front,ep075
633,it's a ranch-style my favorite I mean,ep075
636,yeah but this is not what I wanted at,ep075
639,all it's not even two stories or,ep075
642,anything what we have its 1416 square,ep075
645,feet yeah without the basement that's,ep075
648,just the main floor completely remodeled,ep075
651,okay and what's the price looking like,ep075
654,244 great,ep075
657,solid wood floors that have been,ep075
660,refinished I do like good horse come on,ep075
663,in here we have your diamond even the,ep075
666,living room to open into the kitchen and,ep075
669,the dining room but you know this may be,ep075
672,something I could work right I mean it,ep075
675,has a good flow regardless it does you,ep075
678,know I really wanted white characters,ep075
681,that you know I do love this I,ep075
684,exactly what you wanted there's no stove,ep075
687,a refrigerator so we'd not be included,ep075
690,so all right that's more money if he's,ep075
693,under budget I mean it looks turnkey,ep075
696,initially but now we're starting to get,ep075
699,into you know either projects or just,ep075
702,more money being spent look at the,ep075
705,backyard though that's pretty nice let's,ep075

711,there let's go on this deck it's great,ep075
714,this yard is great Wow this is what I'm,ep075
717,talking to see myself out here grilling,ep075
720,yeah the only thing I don't like,ep075
723,unfortunately is a good old highway,ep075
726,exactly it is a bit close to the highway,ep075
729,with the traffic noise they head back,ep075
732,inside to see the finished basement,ep075

807,was really really nice I'm a huge fan of,ep075
810,course of the basement and the deck,ep075
813,turns of a con it has to be the massive,ep075
816,bedroom bathroom suite,ep075
819,I want a two-story craftsman and this is,ep075
822,clearly not bad so now it's China's turn,ep075

840,"$300,000 budget for a home in the st.",ep075
843,Louis suburb so far they've seen a ranch,ep075
846,his preference that was a little bit too,ep075
849,far from the city and a ranch that was,ep075
852,closer to the city but didn't have the,ep075
855,spacious master suite,ep075
858,China's hoping for today they're in the,ep075
861,city to see a home with more craftsman,ep075
864,character for China oh wow I think oh,ep075
867,boy good I think this neighborhood is,ep075
870,okay it's in the city and we weren't,ep075
873,looking to stay in the city I noticed a,ep075
876,lot of Craftsman style details which I,ep075
879,really love I like the porch show you,ep075
882,this house this is a remodeled Craftsman,ep075
885,built in 1896 oh wow mm 550 square feet,ep075
888,that does not include the basement it's,ep075
891,"249,000 okay really those are beautiful",ep075
894,the refinished art was very nice enough,ep075
897,flowing all throughout this is nice,ep075
900,an open space to it flows from that room,ep075
903,to this one into the kitchen as well and,ep075
906,I love these Traci like these are,ep075
909,beautiful China it's got your islands oh,ep075
912,okay yeah and it's great actually right,ep075
915,I've never seen budgets money to replace,ep075
918,this right right became the catalyst,ep075
921,it's not my white kitchen,ep075
924,they're light though how do you think,ep075
927,what's your backsplash alright great out,ep075
930,here is a nice deck so that you can,ep075
933,grill this is a nice little deck out,ep075
936,here it's a little smaller but you know,ep075
939,what I can still see myself putting a,ep075
942,nice grill over here in this corner or,ep075
945,that corner I mean when you look at the,ep075
948,backyard though there is a lot of space,ep075
951,so if we want to put some patio,ep075
954,furniture out there or something like,ep075
957,that's entertain it wouldn't be too bad,ep075
960,they head back inside to see a half bath,ep075
963,additional living space and the,ep075
966,unfinished basement oh yeah this is not,ep075
969,gonna work I wanted a finished basement,ep075
972,one where I could just go into a skate,ep075
975,and unfortunately this house doesn't,ep075
978,have it it's not a man cave it's a,ep075
981,dungeon they walk up three flights of,ep075
984,stairs to the third floor yeah see this,ep075
987,is why I'm French so here is a bedroom,ep075
990,it'd be an office this is different it,ep075
993,is it's a unique shape they see a full,ep075
996,bath and two more bedrooms then head,ep075
999,down to the second floor laundry room,ep075
1002,pretty so the next room I'd like to show,ep075
1005,you is the master suite,ep075
1008,Wow Wow you've got room for your bedroom,ep075
1011,furniture a sitting room do we even need,ep075
1014,to get the measuring tape out I mean,ep075
1017,honestly,ep075
1020,just in case alright so you were out,ep075
1023,yeah all right what do we got what do we,ep075
1026,got all right eight thirteen and a half,ep075
1029,okay well that meets the minimum,ep075
1032,requirement so so yeah it's definitely,ep075
1035,no problem going this way I think that's,ep075
1038,more than good but yeah your other,ep075
1041,double doors yeah I would just come in,ep075
1044,here to think you know I mean,ep075
1047,don't feel right I'm blown away one more,ep075
1050,super surprise for y'all right ready,ep075
1053,master Wow,ep075
1056,deep soak it's hard Genet oh yes so you,ep075
1059,in the left side you want the right,ep075
1062,beautiful I would never expect it this,ep075
1065,I'm amazed well for starters I love the,ep075
1068,fact that it's to store to actually more,ep075
1071,than the C story it's about oh it's,ep075
1074,beautiful,ep075
1077,look all the Craftsman style finishes I,ep075
1080,would say the major one of the major,ep075
1083,cons is that basement you still do have,ep075
1086,some budget well there's also additional,ep075
1089,finishes that we need to modify for,ep075
1092,example the kitchen we talked about it,ep075
1095,being your first home so right may get,ep075
1098,everything you want yeah after seeing,ep075
1101,several options it won't be an easy,ep075
1104,decision for China and Greg their choice,ep075
1107,might come down to style location and,ep075
1110,condition but we do need to talk about,ep075
1113,these houses that we do,ep075
1116,[Music],ep075
1119,[Music],ep075
1122,first-time buyers Gregg and China have,ep075
1125,"seen how much house $300,000 will get",ep075
1128,them in the st. Louis area now it's time,ep075
1131,to decide so what'd you think about the,ep075
1134,brand-new ranch overall I thought the,ep075
1137,ranch was great yeah it was a good size,ep075
1140,1537 square feet right but it was at the,ep075
1143,top of the budget,ep075
1146,$2.99 9 yeah that means like there's,ep075
1149,little room for any like renovations or,ep075
1152,anything didn't have a deck which was a,ep075
1155,con,ep075
1158,it did have a finished basement which is,ep075
1161,unbelievable but I did not like the,ep075
1164,location yeah I mean it was sporty just,ep075
1167,way too far so what'd you think about,ep075
1170,the 1931 ranch I was a fan of the ranch,ep075
1173,"I think it was 244,000 but I was not",ep075
1176,impressed with that best about it oh and,ep075
1179,on top of that it is close to the,ep075
1182,highway so you can kind of hear some,ep075
1185,highway noise but with that being said,ep075
1188,though it did have the finished basement,ep075
1191,like I like it did have the deck on top,ep075
1194,of that right so how did you feel about,ep075
1197,the remodel Craftsman my two-story,ep075
1200,"three-story it was 249,000 that still",ep075
1203,leaves money to do anything and we will,ep075
1206,need up to update the place um it's,ep075
1209,still in the city right I thought we,ep075
1212,wanted to move away from the city you,ep075
1215,know get get out of here and move to the,ep075
1218,suburbs and that basement,ep075
1221,yeah the basin was atrocious,ep075
1224,[Music],ep075
1227,if I can get my 1971 remodeled ranch I,ep075
1230,will promise you that we can expand the,ep075
1233,master bedroom and we can do how one do,ep075
1236,it we can do it exactly how you want,ep075
1239,then you have your ranch sounds good to,ep075
1242,me,ep075
1245,that's nice so let me show you what,ep075
1248,you've what you got to be living in we,ep075
1251,are officially Oh,ep075
1254,the list price was two hundred and forty,ep075
1257,four thousand but we were able to with,ep075
1260,negotiations get that down to two thirty,ep075
1263,seventy five so we got the keys about,ep075
1266,four weeks ago and then we call,ep075
1269,architects got started right on those,ep075
1272,plans which he promised that I would get,ep075
1275,my master bedroom and yes so the master,ep075
1278,bedroom is now going to be expanded by,ep075
1281,about twelve feet in addition to that,ep075
1284,we're going to be pushing the master,ep075
1287,bath out right so we get a bigger shower,ep075
1290,double vanities our contractor gave us,ep075
1293,an estimate of around thirty eight,ep075
1296,thousand dollars to get the renovation,ep075
1299,done and that's what finishes we've got,ep075
1302,some small things that we painted the,ep075
1305,crown molding install new pendant lights,ep075
1308,in the kitchen,ep075
1311,yes added hardware into the cabinets yes,ep075
1314,unfortunately the backsplash was a,ep075
1317,little bit of a more of a task than what,ep075
1320,we wanted so we got a contractor to come,ep075
1323,in and he did an amazing job on yes I,ep075
1326,didn't get my white cabinetry but I'm,ep075
1329,actually happy with how the kitchen is,ep075
1332,currently I mean so we actually hooked,ep075
1335,up the basement to the nine we have a,ep075
1338,surround sound theater system that was,ep075
1341,put in by my pops we have the projector,ep075
1344,screen we also have a game room area and,ep075
1347,a workout area,ep075
1350,I cannot wait until we get pit bag so we,ep075

1356,near future for us we want to first get,ep075
1359,this renovation done right start a,ep075
1362,family and then just go from there,ep075
1365,slowly but surely starting to feel like,ep075
1368,home,ep075
1371,definitely,ep075
1374,[Music],ep075
12,[Music],ep076
15,yes yes yes first-time buyers Austin and,ep076
18,Holly are searching Orlando for a home,ep076
21,to share with their furry family,ep076
24,I can see Thomas and Winnie just like,ep076
27,chasing each other and then maybe,ep076
30,eventually one or two kids chasing them,ep076
33,but they're not seeing eye-to-eye on,ep076
36,what they need this would definitely be,ep076
39,used for in office or music room and,ep076
42,with Austin wanting modern and Holly,ep076
45,pushing for cozy,ep076
48,it's so cute Craftsman style how will,ep076
51,they find a middle ground door space,ep076
54,nice babe why do I get,ep076
57,[Music],ep076
60,anyone knew this weekend you can come,ep076
63,back here and go to the farmers market,ep076
66,my name is Austin and I work for a,ep076
69,financial services firm my name is Holly,ep076
72,and I'm a course instructor at a local,ep076
75,high school and we have two adorable fur,ep076
78,babies Thomas and Whitney what do you,ep076
81,guys think you guys wanna play this,ep076
84,weekend a little bit come to the park,ep076
87,run around chasing squirrels,ep076
90,we met on Instagram saw this cute girl,ep076
93,yeah might have liked a photo or to a,ep076
96,person left and she liked photo of mine,ep076
99,and before you know what we were,ep076
102,following each other which led to me,ep076
105,calling her on Christmas Eve and we,ep076
108,started talking every single day and we,ep076
111,started dating and then a year and two,ep076
114,months later we got engaged we got,ep076
117,married seven months later I do love,ep076
120,it's a bigger city than where I'm from,ep076
123,yeah some of the things that we love,ep076
126,about Orlando is there's always,ep076
129,something to do well I'm excited to have,ep076
132,a glass of wine I don't know about you,ep076
135,oh yes we're about an hour away from the,ep076
138,Atlantic Ocean we're about an hour and a,ep076
141,half away from the Gulf of Mexico and we,ep076
144,can just take a weekend trip down to the,ep076
147,beach we want to,ep076
150,there's theme parks right nearby it's,ep076
153,like we're in the perfect location now,ep076
156,they're ready to find their first house,ep076
159,together we've lived in North Orlando,ep076
162,now for about two years and both can see,ep076
165,ourselves being here for the foreseeable,ep076
168,future and we need more space we wanna,ep076
171,start a family and I would like to be,ep076
174,able to nest and have a place of our own,ep076
177,to have children I don't want to have,ep076
180,kids in the department what about this,ep076
183,house we would love to have a,ep076
186,single-family home and not be right on,ep076
189,top of neighbors house is probably a,ep076
192,little outside our angel a it's,ep076
195,something that we are concerned about is,ep076
198,the location because as you get closer,ep076
201,to downtown the pricing of the houses,ep076
204,does significantly rise Holly works just,ep076
207,south of downtown and I work in downtown,ep076
210,and so we want to live here in the North,ep076
213,Orlando area something that we really,ep076
216,disagree on is I'm willing to do a,ep076
219,fixer-upper and Holly really is not we,ep076
222,work all the time if we got a,ep076
225,fixer-upper if we never be fixed up so,ep076
228,they've agreed to consider minor,ep076
231,projects as long as it doesn't push them,ep076
234,too far over their three,ep076
237,thousand dollar budget I like the front,ep076
240,porch and the pillars a lot the,ep076
243,architectural style of homes that I,ep076
246,would prefer is definitely the Craftsman,ep076
249,style I really like things that are cozy,ep076
252,and welcoming and I really like being,ep076
255,able to see the materials in the home,ep076
258,like wood brick,ep076
261,unlike Holly while she enjoys the cozy I,ep076
264,actually really liked the modern house,ep076
267,clean lines very white modern doctors,ep076
270,offices,ep076
273,no not doctor's office we would like to,ep076
276,find a home with two bathrooms and at,ep076
279,least three bedrooms one of which can be,ep076
282,an office for me our music room for me,ep076
285,okay we still gotta figure that out,ep076
288,I'd love to have an office or a study of,ep076
291,some variety to be able to work in,ep076
294,Hollywood love to have a music room to,ep076
297,be able to teach her music lessons a,ep076
300,white modern kitchen is also a must-have,ep076
303,for Austin I would love to see more of,ep076
306,the cabinets just be white it will get,ep076
309,so dirty look at this door it's like,ep076
312,welcoming like come and join my home I,ep076
315,love that I feel like hallways the,ep076
318,quirky one here so ouch I don't know if,ep076
321,you consider this quirky but the front,ep076
324,door can make or break the house for me,ep076
327,prominent welcoming the first thing you,ep076
330,see when you drive past the house you'll,ep076
333,just know when it's the right door we,ep076
336,need to have a dual vanity or is that an,ep076
339,option I can't share a sink with you an,ep076
342,open layout hardwood floors and a,ep076
345,fenced-in yard for their dogs round out,ep076
348,their list this homes gonna represent,ep076
351,the B game of family for us and that's,ep076
354,what makes me most excited first up a,ep076
357,craftsman for Holly,ep076
360,so the homo about to show you guys is a,ep076
363,4-bedroom 3-bath oh for little over,ep076
366,"2,300 square feet oh wow and they're",ep076
369,asking three hundred and twenty four,ep076
372,thousand Oh more than what we budgeted I,ep076
375,love the fact that it's a corner lot but,ep076
378,the problem for me is that it takes tall,ep076
381,roads to get to work and it's about 30,ep076
384,to 40 minutes away from our work to the,ep076
387,drive over here was really far but I'm,ep076
390,gonna keep an open mind but it's,ep076
393,definitely gonna be difficult,ep076
396,that's so cute Craftsman style but the,ep076
399,front door is kind of plain but they,ep076
402,painted it blue so that's cute let's go,ep076
405,check it out,ep076
408,[Music],ep076
411,okay it's a cute entertaining area for,ep076
414,sure,ep076
417,I like the arches it is though carpet,ep076
420,it's easy to put down hardwood we're,ep076
423,already over budget though we'd have to,ep076
426,wait to wood floors for a while until,ep076
429,you know kind of we can afford it,ep076
432,there's a ton of carpet but it's cozy,ep076
435,it's comfortable two of the bedrooms are,ep076
438,right this way please out for you guys,ep076
441,this has been definitely being used for,ep076
444,in office music room,ep076
447,all right over here is the guest,ep076
450,bathroom for this area,ep076
453,oh nice it was a full bath good oh my,ep076
456,the sinks a little old looks very 60s,ep076
459,they see another guest bedroom on the,ep076
462,way to the master it's a good-sized,ep076
465,master still carpet still carpet and,ep076
468,then this is the master bath right over,ep076
471,here oh where is my see are you I know I,ep076
474,can't deal with one sink not not with,ep076
477,Austen not a huge fan of the tile kind,ep076
480,of clashes with the best this is,ep076
483,actually a linoleum works across the,ep076
486,hall from the master they see the,ep076
489,kitchen open-concept kitchen I like it,ep076
492,I'm not a huge fan of the cabinet color,ep076
495,I like kind of more white I kind of like,ep076
498,the wood I mean it gives it a cozy,ep076
501,feeling and it's one less project that,ep076
504,we have to add to your long and growing,ep076
507,list of projects on a house that's over,ep076
510,our budget but I do like how it flows,ep076
513,like immediately from the kitchen into,ep076
516,what could be a family room and a large,ep076
519,entertaining space yeah which is great I,ep076
522,do like all the natural lighting in here,ep076
525,it's really nice but I'm really excited,ep076
528,to see the backyard,ep076
531,can we check that out please after you,ep076
534,awesome nice thank you I like it oh my,ep076
537,gosh,ep076
540,Wow this something keeps going this way,ep076
543,and it's fenced in is there yes there is,ep076
546,an HOA it's a little under $300 only,ep076
549,paid quarterly so it's not too bad,ep076
552,ooh I can see Thomas and Wendy just like,ep076
555,chasing each other and then maybe,ep076
558,eventually one or two kids chasing them,ep076
561,back inside they head upstairs to the,ep076
564,fourth bedroom oh wow wow this could be,ep076
567,used for a lot of different things I,ep076
570,think an office a playroom I really,ep076
573,think that this would be much better,ep076
576,served as a music room actually it is,ep076
579,this is technically a fourth bedroom and,ep076
582,it's actually suite hence why they have,ep076
585,the bathroom and the closet,ep076
588,the bathroom is oh yeah pretty standard,ep076
591,I thought the outside was so cute and,ep076
594,cozy and welcoming but I don't like the,ep076
597,location it's like a 30 minute drive,ep076
600,from downtown Orlando I like that,ep076
603,there's enough rooms though to where we,ep076
606,could get a guest bedroom and office and,ep076
609,a music room that is true and the,ep076
612,backyard are you kidding me that was,ep076
615,like amazing I walked out the dogs would,ep076
618,love it may be such a fun entertaining,ep076
621,area but I'm really concerned though,ep076
624,with all the projects and we're already,ep076
627,over budget I just I don't know,ep076
630,this next house has all the upgrades,ep076
633,they both want but holly is still a,ep076
636,tough sell,ep076
639,oh but it's really really bland,ep076
642,[Music],ep076
645,oh my gosh this cookie is gonna be,ep076
648,amazing after looking at houses all day,ep076
651,first-time buyers Austin and Holly are,ep076
654,searching Orlando Florida for a home,ep076
657,their family can grow into but with,ep076
660,different Lots trying to find a house,ep076
663,that meets both of their needs within,ep076
666,"their $300,000 budget has been tricky",ep076
669,and sokka's so far they've seen a,ep076
672,craftsman,ep076
675,Holly's preferred style that had room,ep076
678,for Austin's office and Holly's music,ep076
681,room but it was over budget and lacked a,ep076
684,modern style Austin wants now their,ep076
687,agent is taking them to a fully,ep076
690,renovated home in Maitland 30 minutes,ep076
693,outside downtown Orlando so the home I'm,ep076
696,showing you today is a four-bedroom,ep076
699,two-bath all right it's a little under,ep076
702,"1,700 square feet fully renovated oh and",ep076
705,"they're asking 319,000 oh okay so little",ep076
708,outside of our budget but fully,ep076
711,renovated correct that's good no,ep076
714,projects oh but it's really really bland,ep076
717,where's the character and it's a ranch,ep076
720,you don't even like ranch the rancher is,ep076
723,not exactly our style yeah but I love,ep076
726,this door this is super cute a French,ep076
729,door yeah I love it The Doors very cute,ep076
732,wait until you see the interior oh wow,ep076
735,okay,ep076
738,Wow yes yes this is exactly what I would,ep076
741,want in amazing the would force actually,ep076
744,they look like what they're actually,ep076
747,laminate I wouldn't have imagined,ep076
750,yeah they look really like one okay,ep076
753,kitchen hold on yes yes yes yes yes yes,ep076
756,yes yes this is our kitchen this is our,ep076
759,kitchen right I can definitely tell that,ep076
762,this is your kitchen but I just have a,ep076
765,couple late reservation what is wrong,ep076
768,with this kitchen this looks like the,ep076
771,lava lamp that's okay it's very modern,ep076
774,white cabinets and the dark cabinets I,ep076
777,mean look at this I love the cozy wood,ep076
780,but what is this kiss you want to be he,ep076
783,doesn't want any modern doesn't want to,ep076
786,be cozy it's finding each other,ep076
789,Holly had our little doorframe that's,ep076
792,cozy so I get the modern feeling in the,ep076
795,kitchen and she gets the coziness of the,ep076
798,doorframe that's actually where the,ep076
801,washer and dryer is there's no washer,ep076
804,and dryer with this home you guys have,ep076
807,to work your budget and we have to buy,ep076
810,warm glances we also don't have to do,ep076
813,any renovations on the kitchen because,ep076
816,the kitchen is amazing this is the,ep076
819,dining and it flows I love this over,ep076
822,here you're gonna find guest bathroom oh,ep076
825,yeah we got more modern I still think,ep076
828,it's a little too sterile like the,ep076
831,kitchen I want our guests to feel cozy I,ep076
834,feel very comfortable in here also on,ep076
837,this side of the house are three guest,ep076
840,bedrooms now the nice thing is that I,ep076
843,think that with four bedrooms we could,ep076
846,have both an office and a music room too,ep076
849,now right this way across the home to,ep076
852,the master bedroom all right sounds good,ep076
855,I like that master is on the other side,ep076
858,of the house yeah it keeps us away from,ep076
861,the kids it's a little small my bed and,ep076
864,a dresser would fit in here and not much,ep076
867,else,ep076
870,well one thing I'm noticing though is,ep076
873,that there's no master closet there,ep076
876,actually is it's just inside the master,ep076
879,bath it's like walking into heaven,ep076
882,and we're here we've arrived in heaven,ep076
885,where's the closet you haven't found it,ep076
888,yet oh my gosh this looks small well I,ep076
891,just put like boxes of clothes in,ep076
894,definitely have to add something in here,ep076
897,to hang our clothes on for sure they,ep076
900,head outside to see the backyard oh wow,ep076
903,this is a cute entertaining space yeah,ep076
906,it's very nice and of course we have a,ep076
909,Florida pool but who's gonna maintenance,ep076
912,it is there any way no there's no HOA so,ep076
915,you guys would definitely have to,ep076
918,maintain your own yard but I do like the,ep076
921,yard it's really spacious,ep076
924,this is great the dogs could run around,ep076
927,it's fenced in,ep076
930,yeah the fence is broken the dogs would,ep076
933,escape I think that it just takes a,ep076
936,little bit of patchwork and we can go,ep076
939,and get it right where it needs to be,ep076
942,there's a lot to like you I think yeah,ep076
945,it's a rancher I know that you like the,ep076
948,kitchen but it was a little too modern,ep076
951,for my taste,ep076
954,I like the master bathroom I like the,ep076
957,pool like the backyard but we're still,ep076
960,far away from my work in your work and,ep076
963,you know what they say location location,ep076
966,location but to be closer to their jobs,ep076
969,in the downtown area there's a bit of,ep076
972,give and take is this a townhouse,ep076
975,[Music],ep076
978,cheers to finding our future house yeah,ep076
981,Austin and Holly are hoping their,ep076
984,"$300,000 budget will net them a home in",ep076
987,Orlando Florida where they can start,ep076
990,their family,ep076
993,I want our place to feel like home at,ep076
996,the end of the day right yes,ep076
999,not like a doctor's office so far,ep076
1002,they've seen a craftsman perfect for,ep076
1005,Holly it had a huge backyard but it was,ep076
1008,dated then they saw a ranch with the,ep076
1011,modern white kitchen Austin watts but,ep076
1014,both homes were over budget and a little,ep076
1017,far from their jobs in the downtown area,ep076
1020,so now they're going to see a place,ep076
1023,that's just 10 minutes from downtown is,ep076
1026,this a town house no it's definitely not,ep076
1029,very modern or Craftsman I don't like,ep076
1032,having a shared wall as a town house,ep076
1035,because we don't know who's gonna be,ep076
1038,over there where's the front door I need,ep076
1041,I need the door it's over here oh hey,ep076
1044,guys how's it going well this is the,ep076
1047,town Tomas telling you guys about three,ep076
1050,bedrooms two and a half baths about,ep076
1053,"1,800 square feet and don't forget we're",ep076
1056,in College Park real nice area town I,ep076
1059,think only about a mile from where all,ep076
1062,of your bars and shops and restaurants,ep076
1065,are how much are we looking at actually,ep076
1068,only 285 really yeah that is under,ep076
1071,budget and it would allow for us to have,ep076
1074,some money maybe to do some renovations,ep076
1077,one quick thing sir is an HOA monthly,ep076
1080,it's 200 bucks a month but they do take,ep076
1083,care of most of the stuff outside if you,ep076
1086,have any roof problems so it does kind,ep076
1089,of pay for itself over time all right,ep076
1092,here we have well you might qualify as a,ep076
1095,den or an office also hardwood floors,ep076
1098,all the way throughout it looking real,ep076
1101,nice condition they see a half bath on,ep076
1104,the way to the kitchen oh wow,ep076
1107,the cabinets are a little too wood ish,ep076
1110,for me,ep076
1113,natural homey I mean they feel like,ep076
1116,they're like a decade old I would want,ep076
1119,to maybe paint them like white Austin,ep076
1122,really wants to go in and paint the,ep076
1125,cabinets if we end up with this house,ep076
1128,and that's just not gonna happen,ep076
1131,no way and I'm assuming this would be,ep076
1134,like a living room,ep076
1137,yeah this is probably - your main living,ep076
1140,space I like it lots of light lots of,ep076
1143,windows in this area and on top of that,ep076
1146,it's a great big space for hosting all,ep076
1149,right here we are backyard,ep076
1152,okay the bricks are cute but you can see,ep076
1155,like I can see the neighbor's garage,ep076
1158,door right there and I can see the front,ep076
1161,door of neighbors over there I like the,ep076
1164,backyard,ep076
1167,it's kind of small enough to manage back,ep076
1170,inside they head upstairs to a guest,ep076
1173,room that shares a jack-and-jill,ep076
1176,bathroom with another bedroom this would,ep076
1179,be a great like you know eventually,ep076
1182,nursery but before it's a nursery piano,ep076
1185,room so I'm thinking that this actually,ep076
1188,might be a great study the argument,ep076
1191,about a piano room or an office I say,ep076
1194,mine makes money it's an obvious,ep076
1197,decision down the hall they see the,ep076
1200,master suite oh wow yeah the color of,ep076
1203,the walls it's very breathable,ep076
1206,relatively spacious two master bath,ep076
1209,that's right this way oh I like it,ep076
1212,ah yes dual vanity,ep076
1215,I think the only other thing that I have,ep076
1218,to say about this room is that it is,ep076
1221,carpet oh yeah fresh out of the shower,ep076
1224,wet with carpet not a good combo well,ep076
1227,you know we could always look at with,ep076
1230,that extra money if we're gonna be under,ep076
1233,budget we could possibly do would force,ep076
1236,here as well oh we could find a home,ep076
1239,that doesn't have carpet that's true,ep076
1242,what'd you guys think I love the,ep076
1245,location,ep076
1248,it's close to downtown it's not too far,ep076
1251,from either of our jobs and I love the,ep076
1254,front door,ep076
1257,that's a win for me but it's a townhome,ep076
1260,definitely not a fan of the connection,ep076
1263,to neighbors and we just don't have a,ep076
1266,lot of physical land now they'll have to,ep076
1269,decide what's most important a,ep076
1272,single-family home staying on budget or,ep076
1275,getting a white kitchen okay time to,ep076
1278,make decision,ep076
1281,[Music],ep076
1284,Austin and Molly are ready to settle,ep076
1287,down in Orlando Florida with a budget of,ep076
1290,"$300,000 they've looked at a number of",ep076
1293,homes and are now ready to make a,ep076
1296,decision well what did you think about,ep076
1299,that craftsman that was three hundred,ep076
1302,and twenty four thousand it definitely,ep076
1305,was cute like you wanted but it was over,ep076
1308,budget and there are lots of projects to,ep076
1311,work on it but it was four bedrooms one,ep076
1314,of which was kind of a master suite oh,ep076
1317,my gosh that would be an incredible,ep076
1320,music room I think that it would be,ep076
1323,great as an office can we also talk,ep076
1326,about that backyard that was a great,ep076
1329,entertaining space would be great for,ep076
1332,our dogs and maybe for our kids one day,ep076
1335,but at the end of the day it's like 30,ep076
1338,to 40 minutes away from your work and,ep076
1341,like 30 minutes away from my work how,ep076
1344,about the ranch that was three hundred,ep076
1347,and nineteen thousand I mean it,ep076
1350,definitely was not the look that either,ep076
1353,of us likes I mean it was really bland,ep076
1356,super super bland on the outside but the,ep076
1359,home inside oh my gosh the vaulted,ep076
1362,ceilings the laminate slash wood floors,ep076
1365,laminate it looked real at night to the,ep076
1368,floors and the kitchen the kitchen was,ep076
1371,easily the best kitchen that we saw and,ep076
1374,I loved loved loved that kitchen I love,ep076
1377,to see you so happy but I was not a fan,ep076
1380,of that kitchen that's a little too,ep076
1383,sterile for me there was something,ep076
1386,cozier,ep076
1389,but that master bath was literally,ep076
1392,heaven in that backyard it was big and,ep076
1395,the pool was awesome I know you're,ep076
1398,excited about possibly having a pool but,ep076
1401,I just see dollar signs with the,ep076
1404,maintenance and it could be a safety,ep076
1407,issue if we grow our family and is a,ep076
1410,little outside the location that we,ep076
1413,wanted so what do you think the townhome,ep076
1416,that came in at two hundred and eighty,ep076
1419,five thousand you know I liked it it,ep076
1422,wasn't really either one of the styles,ep076
1425,that we wanted but it was two-story and,ep076
1428,I was kind of cute outside the kitchen,ep076
1431,was exactly what I wanted,ep076
1434,cozy warm inviting definitely a place,ep076
1437,that we could have people over it was a,ep076
1440,shared waldo oh yeah I don't like the,ep076
1443,idea of living with neighbors next to us,ep076
1446,they could be weird they could be,ep076
1449,strange don't really know you know wow,ep076
1452,it could be very loud,ep076
1455,had my music room but not a fourth,ep076
1458,bedroom for your office but it wasn't,ep076
1461,the location that we really wanted I,ep076
1464,definitely know what I'm feeling I think,ep076
1467,"I like the townhouse that was 285,000",ep076
1470,what was so cozy and cute it was under,ep076
1473,budget and on top of that it was also in,ep076
1476,location that we wanted to I'm very,ep076
1479,excited for this house,ep076
1482,don't go tell Phil yes itself oh it,ep076
1485,feels amazing to finally be in our new,ep076
1488,home we moved in about two weeks ago and,ep076
1491,who we're definitely a work in progress,ep076
1494,coffee mugs for the morning originally,ep076
1497,"our town home was listed for $285,000",ep076
1500,but we got down to 279 so we're even,ep076
1503,more under budget than what we wanted to,ep076
1506,be well you got your office I think that,ep076
1509,we got enough bedrooms but we definitely,ep076
1512,didn't get a place that would be kind of,ep076
1515,an office or a music room because it's,ep076
1518,just one or the other so you get your,ep076
1521,office,ep076
1524,[Music],ep076
1527,I gave up the music room and my piano is,ep076
1530,downstairs which I think has better,ep076
1533,acoustics anyway it worked out,ep076
1536,we've even met our neighbors who are on,ep076
1539,the wall next to us and they're really,ep076
1542,cool so we have very little worries,ep076
1545,about that at this point the dogs love,ep076
1548,the backyard and we love the backyard to,ep076
1551,it nobody okay,ep076
1554,get a get it you play ball we play catch,ep076
1557,it's really great,ep076
1560,I think we're most excited about,ep076
1563,starting a family here it's just gonna,ep076
1566,be a place where a lot of memories are,ep076
1569,made and we're very excited for that,ep076
1572,you,ep076
12,Wow yeah J and Amanda are searching for,ep077
15,their forever home in Reed evil,ep077
18,Tennessee but there's a catch it also,ep077
21,has to function as a bed-and-breakfast,ep077
24,this be a great room for entertaining,ep077
27,he's hoping for something historic,ep077
30,this one was built in early 1800s,ep077
33,there's not much modern about this place,ep077
36,it's quirky but she prefers something,ep077
39,updated look at that tub okay I love,ep077
42,this with fantasies of a spa-like master,ep077
45,bath and high-end chef's kitchen two,ep077
48,islands for from zero islands to two,ep077
51,islands can they actually find a home,ep077
54,that will work for both them and their,ep077
57,guests that's not working for me,ep077
60,upstairs have to wait Londo ago the,ep077
63,bathroom so there might be a problem,ep077
66,[Music],ep077
69,my name is J I'm Amanda and Human,ep077
72,Resources for a hospital company I'm a,ep077
75,social worker for the local County,ep077

99,we live right outside of Nashville very,ep077
102,small town red oval Tennessee there's,ep077
105,basically just a gas station a post,ep077
108,office and a small restaurant here and,ep077
111,is nice being removed from the big city,ep077
114,I guess that's slower pace right on the,ep077
117,river Stones River instant-read you bill,ep077
120,we love that it's quiet it's just it's,ep077
123,beautiful yeah it's a milk the good we,ep077
126,lived in the home for 10 years and at a,ep077
129,nowhere company made an offer to buy it,ep077
132,to turn into a rental property so we,ep077
135,sold it without much planning so we've,ep077
138,been renting for the last three years,ep077
141,we've outgrown the apartment life we're,ep077
144,definitely looking forward to buying a,ep077
147,home in this general area person loves,ep077
150,to be outside their door opens and he is,ep077
153,out the door so we want a place for him,ep077
156,to play outside you have the tractor I'm,ep077
159,darn growing up you know being able to,ep077
162,run through the woods and playing the,ep077
165,creeks and that sort of thing we want,ep077
168,lot fun to be able to do to have that,ep077
171,there you go get some leverage on it,ep077
174,you guys were rad Betty I grew up in the,ep077
177,same home until I was in college and,ep077
180,there's just so many memories and so I,ep077
183,kinda want to make a place like that for,ep077
186,Lachlan I never had that forever home,ep077
189,that a man had grown up in and that's,ep077
192,always something I've always desired,ep077
195,Meera's big enough you ready in harm no,ep077
198,but buying their forever home isn't,ep077
201,enough they want to turn this future,ep077
204,house into a bed-and-breakfast,ep077
207,we've always loved hosting people we,ep077
210,love to cook to bring host people for a,ep077
213,living,ep077
216,that would be ideal that's our dream,ep077
219,it's my goal to be able to retire for my,ep077
222,day job and just do the,ep077
225,bed-and-breakfast full-time so their new,ep077
228,home would need to house them as well as,ep077
231,their future B&amp;B guests it looks like it,ep077
234,goes in old colonial home it's not bad I,ep077
237,guess our max budget is around 625,ep077
240,think we at least need to have four,ep077
243,bedrooms and I think of a bad breakfast,ep077
246,I think about our stork older home maybe,ep077
249,a Victorian or colonial style something,ep077
252,that's got the detailed craftsmanship,ep077
255,crown molding hardwood floors I like the,ep077
258,idea of kind of mixing it up and doing,ep077
261,something more modern for a better,ep077
264,breakfast I do not want things that have,ep077
267,to be updated I want a house that's,ep077
270,turnkey ready to go James a lot of,ep077
273,things but not a handyman she doesn't,ep077
276,think I'm a very good handyman I made,ep077
279,some repairs one involving an aspirin,ep077
282,bottle and a bunch of pennies to fix a,ep077
285,commode the duct tape and a couple of,ep077
288,golf clubs to fix our Alam or some,ep077
291,people a save call that genius so the,ep077
294,kitchen area is gonna be one of the most,ep077
297,important spots in our house I guess we,ep077
300,need to learn some professional skills,ep077
303,there now that we're cooking for our,ep077
306,guests yeah well I'm happy to help we do,ep077
309,a lot of cooking challenges where we'll,ep077
312,go by each other challenging ingredients,ep077
315,and say you can make the best dish with,ep077
318,them so we need a kitchen large enough,ep077
321,where we can share the the stove at the,ep077
324,same time do either one of you have a,ep077
327,preference on what you work on biscuits,ep077
330,or frittata I'm more of a recipe,ep077
333,follower so I should probably do the,ep077
336,biscuit one issue one area we agree on,ep077
339,we deftly in one a chef's kitchen with,ep077
342,the modern appliances large stove at,ep077
345,least six burners a couple ovens Jay and,ep077
348,Amanda also have high hopes for their,ep077
351,new master bath wanting separate,ep077
354,vanities and a soaking tub for Amanda as,ep077
357,long as it's not part of a shower/tub,ep077
360,combo I hate the shower/tub combo I want,ep077
363,a separate stand-up shower without a,ep077
366,shower curtain I think that's probably,ep077
369,the biggest thing is the the shower,ep077
372,curtain is and of course we like a nice,ep077
375,outdoor area covered patio where we can,ep077
378,sit and a big yard for Lachlan and,ep077
381,brought the plan ideally they'd like to,ep077
384,stay in read evil but they're open to,ep077
387,nearby areas as long as they share that,ep077
390,small-town feel she has a fear of,ep077
393,commitment when it comes to making large,ep077
396,purchases a big deal it's a big purchase,ep077
399,I don't want to make any mistakes so,ep077
402,today their real-estate agent Doug,ep077
405,Austin has lined up a Victorian style,ep077
408,farmhouse in the neighboring small town,ep077
411,of Christiana was built in the early,ep077
414,"nineties around 1992 just under 3,300",ep077
417,Square feet listed at 5:45 Jay I think,ep077
420,you're gonna like a little bit more of,ep077
423,that Victorian style in a minute I think,ep077
426,you're gonna like a lot of the more,ep077
429,modern touches on the inside okay let's,ep077
432,check it out all right,ep077
435,got a qqz bow they're connected abortion,ep077
438,oh wow this is what I'm talking about,ep077
441,yeah everything looks new because this,ep077
444,farm door oh yeah I love that,ep077
447,sure I feel about the door opening up,ep077
450,into the dining room yeah that's a,ep077
453,little unusual I've noticed that they've,ep077
456,got bigger things like the vents here I,ep077
459,think that's a nice modern touch and,ep077
462,there's a lot of modern touches all,ep077
465,throughout the house,ep077
468,let's go there's a little sitting area,ep077
471,over here okay maybe the dining room,ep077
474,could be here it's got the crown molding,ep077
477,and the chair rails yeah you can,ep077
480,definitely move things around and change,ep077
483,them however you like you're gonna love,ep077
486,this kitchen granite tops an undermount,ep077
489,sink stainless steel appliances big,ep077
492,modern sinks stick Lockland right in,ep077
495,there not have to bend over to bathe us,ep077
498,the kitchen would be nice for,ep077
501,entertaining purposes but it is probably,ep077
504,too small for a bed-and-breakfast in,ep077
507,order for the amount of number of guests,ep077
510,we're have to cook for then here's of,ep077
513,course the living room alright got a,ep077
516,fireplace in it I do like that man oh,ep077
519,yeah that's nice detailed work there,ep077
522,what do you think about the size of the,ep077
525,room I think it's pretty small actually,ep077
528,if we're hosting people and it's gonna,ep077
531,be tight in here two left over here's,ep077
534,the master bedroom it's not a huge room,ep077
537,to fit this much furniture maybe but,ep077
540,this furniture is so big it's our detail,ep077
543,I like the hardwood floors but no crown,ep077
546,molding here's the master bathroom,ep077
549,beautiful stand-up shower I love this no,ep077
552,shower curtain here but no tub yeah how,ep077
555,much I wanna tell ya there's not much,ep077
558,space for one true let's have the double,ep077
561,vanities though very modern-looking,ep077
564,yes no work needed I like that they head,ep077
567,upstairs to see two bedrooms that share,ep077
570,a jack-and-jill bathroom yeah I'm not,ep077
573,sure how this flows potentially you,ep077
576,could have a space where you staged and,ep077
579,closed one door off and gonna have a,ep077
582,sitting area where people can kind of,ep077
585,wait to use the bathroom how do you do I,ep077
588,just have to get creative with these,ep077
591,rooms,ep077
594,definitely that they see two more,ep077
597,standalone bedrooms this makes five,ep077
600,bedrooms yes sir,ep077
603,you just keep multiplying so these,ep077
606,guests are supposed to share the jack,ep077
609,and a half that's that idea let's wait,ep077
612,Londe wash your hands and then wait live,ep077
615,together back,ep077
618,so there might be a problem okay I don't,ep077
621,know if this space will work we need,ep077
624,more bathrooms especially for the guests,ep077
627,so take a lot of extra work in order to,ep077
630,get it to to be a bed-and-breakfast nice,ep077
633,outdoor patio area here a good-sized,ep077
636,yard take the patio area need some work,ep077
639,though I'd really like to have a covered,ep077
642,patio area this is the outdoor,ep077
645,recreation building a little bit of,ep077
648,whatever you want to make it really kind,ep077
651,of a utility building it's a decent size,ep077
654,I have to I guess do some beautifying on,ep077
657,it come on in,ep077
660,Wow yeah it's a big space big open space,ep077
663,when the elections in here you've got,ep077
666,HVAC power plumbing everything kind of,ep077
669,all in place so you can really do,ep077
672,whatever you want with it a lot of,ep077
675,potential we can build it out maybe rent,ep077
678,it out as a suite this we can test out,ep077
681,your handyman skills yeah there's a lot,ep077
684,of things I love about this place it's,ep077
687,turnkey ready to go I love the country,ep077
690,it's beautiful out here but that's not,ep077
693,working for me upstairs we have a bed,ep077
696,and breakfast you almost need a private,ep077
699,bathroom for each individual guest and,ep077
702,that's concerning today but we can use,ep077
705,the Bekaa building there to add on,ep077
708,keflex or Suites that's how the,ep077
711,Victorian mix with a farmhouse but it's,ep077
714,not stork,ep077
717,I mean it's built in 92 so it's old but,ep077
720,it doesn't have that store quality that,ep077
723,was looking for so now their agents,ep077
726,taking them to see something that offers,ep077
729,quite a bit more historic charm this one,ep077
732,was built in early 1800s it's 200 years,ep077
735,old 200 years worth of problems,ep077
738,[Music],ep077
741,there's something that screams,ep077
744,bed-and-breakfast it does je and Amanda,ep077
747,are searching the read evil Tennessee,ep077
750,area for a house that will double as a,ep077
753,bed-and-breakfast and a family home to,ep077
756,raise their toddler Lachlan that is so,ep077
759,cute,ep077
762,thank this block like a fitness yes,ep077
765,"working with a budget of $625,000",ep077
768,they've seen an updated farmhouse in,ep077
771,nearby Christiana it had the modern feel,ep077
774,for Amanda and a vintage like exterior,ep077
777,for Jay but the upstairs layout would be,ep077
780,awkward for their B&amp;B guests so today,ep077
783,their agent Doug is showing them a house,ep077
786,in Reed evil he hopes is better suited,ep077
789,for accommodating guests this one was,ep077
792,built in early 1800s by Colonel reading,ep077
795,that's about a town became known as Reed,ep077
798,evil there's not much modern about this,ep077
801,place as far as a bed-and-breakfast goes,ep077
804,they store colonial style little over,ep077
807,six thousand square feet I guess you're,ep077
810,in charge of all the cleaning come on in,ep077
813,ceiling now that's a grand entrance look,ep077
816,at the craftsmanship and the medallion,ep077
819,on the chandelier and trim around the,ep077
822,door they just don't build them like,ep077
825,this anymore she liked to check out the,ep077
828,dining room absolutely,ep077
831,look at that is gorgeous yeah we never,ep077
834,had a officially formal dining room,ep077
837,before I think we've never had a room,ep077
840,this big yeah this is about the size of,ep077
843,our first apartment kitchen yes two,ep077
846,islands we didn't went from zero islands,ep077
849,to two islands like that it's a very,ep077
852,modern kitchen it's two ovens we got at,ep077
855,least with six burners there and the,ep077
858,flat top grill this is like a restaurant,ep077
861,stove a little intimating yeah,ep077
864,definitely didn't have that in the 1800s,ep077
867,here's the living room,ep077
870,these rooms are ginormous yeah and,ep077
873,another fireplace not going yet are,ep077
876,these the original hardwood floors,ep077
879,absolutely all original there's a,ep077
882,bedroom through here yeah this is,ep077
885,actually the master bedroom on the main,ep077
888,floor the decent sized room and a full,ep077
891,bath right around the corner over there,ep077
894,it's got the stand-up shower but,ep077
897,shower-curtain know how much I hate,ep077
900,those shower curtains I'm not a fan of,ep077
903,the pedestal sinks the beveling and,ep077
906,stuff is hard to take care of well,ep077
909,you'll be due another cleaning session,ep077
912,I'm not sure why I'm worried about that,ep077
915,I'm gonna check out the formal living,ep077
918,room in here sure do we need this much,ep077
921,space for a bed and breakfast I think,ep077
924,we're gonna need the space it's just I,ep077
927,feel like we're gonna spend every day,ep077
930,cleaning this place they head upstairs,ep077
933,to look at a bath this is the community,ep077
936,bathroom see 1lm bitch I hate doing the,ep077
939,stand-up shower let's get the shower,ep077
942,curtain up and two more large bedrooms,ep077
945,one has an old servant staircase this,ep077
948,room here is actually not finished being,ep077
951,renovated it is a lot of work yeah it's,ep077
954,kind of a safety hazard there with,ep077
957,Lachlan no redo the walls as well it's,ep077
960,gonna be expensive to redo this room,ep077
963,though it's quirky close there's,ep077
966,actually another closet in the master,ep077
969,bathroom over here closet we can turn,ep077
972,this into another bedroom and run out,ep077
975,this is not much of a master bath,ep077
978,there's no double vanities like yeah,ep077
981,shower/tub combo the floors have to be,ep077
984,redone it's kind of hard to have,ep077
987,character without history which means,ep077
990,it's not always in the best condition,ep077
993,everything I see just needs work it's,ep077
996,200 years worth of problems and not many,ep077
999,skills to fix them outside they see a,ep077
1002,covered patio Wow lovely out here,ep077
1005,ceiling fans and everything it's nice,ep077
1008,and there's a pavilion big enough to,ep077
1011,host large events such as a wedding I'd,ep077
1014,love to see this at night with all the,ep077
1017,lights lit up I'm sure it'd look great a,ep077
1020,great spot for a venue of any kind,ep077
1023,okay and then do the ceremony's down,ep077
1026,there you could do almost like family,ep077
1029,reunions or something here as well and,ep077
1032,then have bed-and-breakfast guests yeah,ep077
1035,at the house absolutely when the hell,ep077
1038,how that River will rise,ep077
1041,I love the fact that it's a colonial,ep077
1044,he's got a lot of character at all the,ep077
1047,detailed work that kitchen definitely,ep077
1050,has no wow factor that we were looking,ep077
1053,at I was gonna be happy with the Creek,ep077
1056,but an actual river that runs to the,ep077
1059,property yeah and the pavilion we could,ep077
1062,host weddings in addition to the,ep077
1065,bed-and-breakfast nights no bathrooms,ep077
1068,need to be replaced in one room there,ep077
1071,that need to be clearly redone but,ep077
1074,hopefully it can be an easy fix with its,ep077
1077,remodeling it is just too much work when,ep077
1080,I think about the house being 200 years,ep077
1083,old that's all I see is money money,ep077
1086,money just going out the door with,ep077
1089,Amanda's concerns in mind their agent,ep077
1092,has found them a much more modern house,ep077
1095,its traditional which is more of what I,ep077
1098,wanted and it doesn't need any work I,ep077
1101,think it's close to perfect,ep077
1104,[Music],ep077
1107,delicious is that a bed and breakfast is,ep077
1110,just biscuits impregnate yeah wanting to,ep077
1113,live in and operate a bed and breakfast,ep077
1116,has J and Amanda on the hunt for the,ep077
1119,perfect home near Rita Ville Tennessee,ep077
1122,the best thing about a frittata is that,ep077
1125,it can last for hours,ep077
1128,yes so far they've seen two homes below,ep077
1131,they're six hundred and twenty five,ep077
1134,thousand dollar budget one a Victorian,ep077
1137,style farmhouse that had the modern,ep077
1140,upgrades Amanda likes but lacked,ep077
1143,historic charm for Jay the other a 200,ep077
1146,year old colonial exactly what Jay wants,ep077
1149,but Amanda was concerned that it needed,ep077
1152,work so now they're in the town of,ep077
1155,Franklin about an hour away from Reed,ep077
1158,evil to see a newer and more modern,ep077
1161,house for Amanda it's not really that,ep077
1164,historic look I was looking for no it's,ep077
1167,traditional which is more of what I,ep077
1170,wanted yeah and it doesn't need any work,ep077
1173,I love the brick want the landscaping I,ep077
1176,think it's close to perfect it was built,ep077
1179,"in 2003 priced right at 600,000 towards",ep077
1182,"the top of our budget just under 4,000",ep077
1185,square feet it's four bedrooms three,ep077
1188,baths and 2 half baths and over here,ep077
1191,we've got the office yeah that's nice,ep077
1194,space well built-ins that's beautiful,ep077
1197,yeah it's got the crown molding which I,ep077
1200,like and the French doors and on the,ep077
1203,other side of the for you of course the,ep077
1206,dining room the color and the walls not,ep077
1209,what we would pick out,ep077
1212,Mustard's not your thing there are some,ep077
1215,minor things I would change the paint,ep077
1218,color would be number one on the list,ep077
1221,don't check out the living room yeah I,ep077
1224,do like all the windows it makes the,ep077
1227,room look bigger and brighter yeah it's,ep077
1230,a nice fireplace they're not all Houma,ep077
1233,stoves a lot of character to it not a,ep077
1236,detailed work through the kitchen please,ep077
1239,right off the living room here okay got,ep077
1242,the gas stove you're looking for yeah,ep077
1245,it's a nice gas stove doesn't have the,ep077
1248,double oven I'm okay with the stove here,ep077
1251,but not a fan of the microwave above the,ep077
1254,stove and how do you feel about the,ep077
1257,space in here it's a little bit tight,ep077
1260,yeah it's not huge it's functional it's,ep077
1263,not perfect the kitchen is not exactly,ep077
1266,what I want but low maintenance is what,ep077
1269,I'm looking for and this is exactly that,ep077
1272,you're gonna let the outside Wow look at,ep077
1275,this exactly what we were looking for a,ep077
1278,browser,ep077
1281,don't face that that we were wanting a,ep077
1284,nice big yard for Brock and Lachlan to,ep077
1287,play it let's get a fire pit well though,ep077
1290,it seems a little bit loud there's,ep077
1293,actually an interstate just beyond the,ep077
1296,property here okay maybe you can,ep077
1299,convince your guests it's the sound of,ep077
1302,the ocean it's a nice area for hosting,ep077
1305,but they're with the interstate right,ep077
1308,there it's not real relaxing for our,ep077
1311,guess the traffic is a little bit,ep077
1314,concerning but I think after maybe a few,ep077
1317,cocktails our guests won't care as much,ep077
1320,they head back inside to see two guest,ep077
1323,rooms and a shared bath before checking,ep077
1326,out the first master suite this is a,ep077
1329,nice space get the tray ceiling that's a,ep077
1332,nice touch though we got master bath,ep077
1335,here pistol sinks the separate shower,ep077
1338,and tub we're looking for Aaron help me,ep077
1341,get in all right okay,ep077
1344,this looks really small it's gonna fit,ep077
1347,you perfect perfect yes and everything,ep077
1350,in there okay I love this upstairs they,ep077
1353,see a second master suite oh well nice,ep077
1356,high ceilings I think you're gonna be,ep077
1359,impressed with the bathroom this is even,ep077
1362,better than last oh look at that it's,ep077
1365,amazing look at that tub separate,ep077
1368,vanities so look at this shower the,ep077
1371,whole room in there yeah that's gorgeous,ep077
1374,I wish they had a separate room for the,ep077
1377,commode though we figure using the,ep077
1380,restroom and you get the whole bathroom,ep077
1383,so it could be one in the shower others,ep077
1386,use the restroom so we could I love the,ep077
1389,bathroom to the shower alone is worth,ep077
1392,taking that room for but that allows for,ep077
1395,the master bedroom downstairs to be,ep077
1398,rented out and I think that is a huge,ep077
1401,selling point so what's this way Doug,ep077
1404,I've got a bonus room over over on this,ep077
1407,side that's that same oh yeah look at,ep077
1410,the bar there the bar come with the,ep077
1413,house,ep077
1416,and we can ask for it this be a great,ep077
1419,room for entertaining absolutely it's,ep077
1422,gorgeous,ep077
1425,live it or not the rim gets bigger right,ep077
1428,this way oh wow the hallway yeah it's a,ep077
1431,whole nother room in here,ep077
1434,we get all kind of space back here wow I,ep077
1437,didn't think about a workout room for a,ep077
1440,bed and breakfast but it's early not a,ep077
1443,bad idea,ep077
1446,I really like the curb appeal I love the,ep077
1449,brick in the stonework I did have a,ep077
1452,really nice master bathroom you seem to,ep077
1455,love the tub in there I do like a little,ep077
1458,paint and I'll be turnkey-ready and not,ep077
1461,a lot of upkeep the kitchen wasn't huge,ep077
1464,I really like to have double ovens,ep077
1467,excellent outdoor living space as,ep077
1470,another thing that we're looking for,ep077
1473,it's a little loud though that's,ep077
1476,concerning since the the highway is so,ep077
1479,close the noise of the interstate that's,ep077
1482,something that really have to think,ep077
1485,about after seeing several options Jay,ep077
1488,and Amanda have a tough decision ahead,ep077
1491,of them their choice may come down to,ep077
1494,level of upkeep a covered patio or if,ep077
1497,they should live with or without a,ep077
1500,chef's kitchen it's a big decision and,ep077
1503,it's a big decision,ep077
1506,"working with a budget of $625,000 J and",ep077
1509,Amanda have looked at several homes that,ep077
1512,can double as a bed-and-breakfast in the,ep077
1515,read evil Tennessee area now it's time,ep077
1518,to make a decision so what did you think,ep077
1521,about the Victorian farmhouse well I,ep077
1524,like the fact there's a Victorian it was,ep077
1527,all updated it was a little tight though,ep077
1530,in the kitchen area don't you think yeah,ep077
1533,the kitchen was definitely small and,ep077
1536,then upstairs had that weird bathroom,ep077
1539,situation that was one jacked-up,ep077
1542,bathroom one of the bonuses that had the,ep077
1545,building in the backyard that I think we,ep077
1548,could build out into one maybe two,ep077
1551,Suites priced only slightly higher is,ep077
1554,the historic colonial for five hundred,ep077
1557,and forty-nine thousand dollars that was,ep077
1560,exactly the house I picture when you say,ep077
1563,a bed-and-breakfast offers all the,ep077
1566,history that you can't get anywhere else,ep077
1569,the kitchen was amazing it's beautiful,ep077
1572,but then we have the bathrooms that need,ep077
1575,work the bathrooms were probably the,ep077
1578,worst ones out of the three houses it's,ep077
1581,also a lot of house all I see is all the,ep077
1584,work that needs to be done the,ep077
1587,traditional house was probably the,ep077
1590,prettiest house I think ahead was,ep077
1593,"updated and at 600,000 it was also the",ep077
1596,most expensive home of the bunch the two,ep077
1599,master bedrooms so be a huge selling,ep077
1602,point,ep077
1605,the huge bonus room with the extra bonus,ep077
1608,room off of it this house was also very,ep077
1611,low maintenance the only thing I really,ep077
1614,needed to be done was changing a little,ep077
1617,bit of the paint colors and the,ep077
1620,wonderful outdoor living space that was,ep077
1623,definitely my favorite part about that,ep077
1626,house it's probably that oh goodness,ep077
1629,loud with the traffic all right it's a,ep077
1632,big decision it is a big decision,ep077
1635,so after all this discussion I think,ep077
1638,that um actually I can't leave I'm going,ep077
1641,to say this but I think the colonial is,ep077
1644,the one for us yes I think that's ideal,ep077
1647,for a bed-and-breakfast and the fact,ep077
1650,that we can make it a wedding venue,ep077
1653,that's something we didn't count on,ep077
1656,Khalid I make the offer let's call him,ep077
1659,all right whole thing over I think this,ep077
1662,property was out deals just land is,ep077
1665,breathtaking it's so beautiful and,ep077
1668,peaceful out here I think the wow factor,ep077
1671,with the home that we purchased the fact,ep077
1674,that it's got so much history three,ep077
1677,presidents have stayed here and it was,ep077
1680,used as an Army Hospital for the south,ep077
1683,and the north and the Civil War let's go,ep077
1686,swing in our gazebo we paid you two,ep077
1689,asking price at 549 but we didn't ago,ep077
1692,she ate all the furniture and all the,ep077
1695,tables of chairs that come along with,ep077
1698,the wedding venue so we saved a lot of,ep077
1701,money there as far as having to fill,ep077
1704,bunch of bedrooms and extra rooms there,ep077
1707,you think buddy pretty cool I think this,ep077
1710,property is gonna be a ton of work it's,ep077
1713,gonna be a lot of work but house is old,ep077
1716,I think that we really lucky with the,ep077
1719,kitchen that kitchen is amazing I,ep077
1722,couldn't ask for anything better than,ep077
1725,that,ep077
1728,Oh cake we have a lot unpacking to do,ep077
1731,can't wait to get this kitchen start,ep077
1734,cooking though and the outdoor living,ep077
1737,space it's a perfect place to watch,ep077
1740,Lachlan and Brock play outside get some,ep077
1743,fishing poles and come down here and,ep077
1746,fish overlooks the river and the water,ep077
1749,provides a really relaxing quiet,ep077
1752,environment for our guests skip this one,ep077
1755,Tibetan breakfasts well we should be up,ep077
1758,and running here in a couple of weeks,ep077
1761,and do some upkeep at the house but I,ep077
1764,think pretty soon we'll be ready to,ep077
1767,start rent out rooms and making,ep077
1770,frittatas and make a frittata I want to,ep077
1773,thank you for once come into our men,ep077
1776,breakfast,ep077

15,this is a good size Caroline and Kayla,ep078
18,are on the hunt for their first home in,ep078
21,Syracuse New York and they have two,ep078
24,must-haves lots of storage and a garage,ep078
27,I told you but in their price range they,ep078
30,might have to take the good with the bad,ep078
33,very yellow these people really love,ep078
36,them some yellow I feel like I'm in a,ep078
39,maze of sunflowers,ep078
42,I'm Thanksgiving the turkey would just,ep078
45,dis alright go my good oh my goodness,ep078
48,that's disgusting you might have to,ep078
51,splurge on a new oven,ep078
54,[Music],ep078
57,my name is Caroline my name is Kayla so,ep078
60,we met through mutual friend actually,ep078
63,and it went really fast and we decided,ep078
66,to move in together and we start our own,ep078
69,little fur family we have two dogs and,ep078
72,two cats Oh within two years two years,ep078
75,I've been gonna three years now I just,ep078
78,recently got married so we've been,ep078
81,newlyweds about about two months now,ep078
84,mm-hmm,ep078
87,she keeps the dates I like everything,ep078
90,you could do in Syracuse there are so,ep078
93,many state parks there are lakes there,ep078
96,are trails to climb Kayla and I go,ep078
99,hiking almost every weekend but lunch is,ep078
102,my name coffee coffee,ep078
105,Janine creamer yeah we're currently,ep078
108,living with my mom right now in between,ep078
111,apartment living and house hunting,ep078
114,so hopefully that and soon we can find a,ep078
117,house because we're definitely ready to,ep078
120,have our own space for our budget for,ep078
123,"this purchase of 130,000 I tend to be a",ep078
126,little more practical so I'd like to,ep078
129,keep it a little lower than that if,ep078
132,possible I think if we go any lower we,ep078
135,might not find all the stuff that we,ep078
138,want we have a big wish list we are a,ep078
141,little picky yeah I feel like this space,ep078
144,is too small the first thing on their,ep078
147,list is a three bedroom house with good,ep078
150,sized bedrooms but they disagree on how,ep078
153,to use them all I think the dogs need,ep078
156,their own room I mean they have food and,ep078
159,they have water and they have toys I,ep078
162,don't know that we necessarily need a,ep078
165,whole room for the dogs that could,ep078
168,become accustomed that's where we differ,ep078
171,well that's a cute ranch I grew up in a,ep078
174,ranch home and to me that feels like,ep078
177,home,ep078
180,I don't like ranch Styles because,ep078
183,they're just like a big like,ep078
186,rectangle you know I don't like this at,ep078
189,all this is way more your style than,ep078
192,fine I mean it's the Cape Cod I like the,ep078
195,Cape Cod's it just looks like a perfect,ep078
198,little,ep078
201,ideal home and my biggest issue at them,ep078
204,as the ceilings and the upstairs are,ep078
207,like a dollhouse,ep078
210,and you just feel so closed in but,ep078
213,you're only five foot,ep078
216,that's a nice kitchen I like the white,ep078
219,cabinets in the stainless steel I kind,ep078
222,of want granite countertops just kind of,ep078
225,a big kitchen that's updated and it just,ep078
228,looks nice I definitely want moving,ep078
231,ready we don't really have any,ep078
234,experience with fixing things or,ep078
237,renovating anything we just kind of want,ep078
240,it done for us they also want a formal,ep078
243,dining room for Kayla's family visits,ep078
246,and a big fenced yard for their dogs and,ep078
249,themselves whoa,ep078
252,that's pretty cool probably putting,ep078
255,hammock and the garden back there yeah,ep078
258,that's true a hammock is kind of,ep078
261,something that's really important to,ep078
264,Kayla and I love reading laying in the,ep078
267,hammock um so there were a couple of,ep078
270,trees in the backyard that we could kind,ep078
273,of hook the hammock up to that'd be,ep078
276,awesome it would be number one,ep078
279,deal-breaker is closet space I mean to,ep078
282,women you have clothes out the wazoo Oh,ep078
285,two car garage that's true,ep078
288,Syracuse is like number two and top,ep078
291,snowfall in the entire country so it,ep078
294,would be absolutely amazing if we could,ep078
297,get some sort of garage we need it in,ep078
300,the snow but it's surprisingly difficult,ep078
303,to find in Syracuse most houses don't,ep078
306,have two car garages or a garage at all,ep078
309,which is confusing I am so excited to,ep078
312,start this process we have such a big,ep078
315,wish list I've kind of had our heart set,ep078
318,on it,ep078
321,hopefully we'll be able to find a good,ep078
324,compromise today their agent tisha has,ep078
327,lined up a home that's more Kayla style,ep078
330,okay today girls we're going to see a,ep078
333,raised ranch 129,ep078
336,three bedrooms one and a half baths but,ep078
339,it's really loud I know I know the,ep078
342,highway is right there but keep an open,ep078
345,mind you're gonna love this house,ep078
348,my relationship with Caroline is very,ep078
351,special and it goes back to when she was,ep078
354,a little girl when Caroline was younger,ep078
357,I used to watch her after school and,ep078
360,then as she got older and became a,ep078
363,teenager she would watch my boys when,ep078
366,they were growing up,ep078
369,I like it's cute I love the clean lines,ep078
372,of this house it's totally my style I,ep078
375,personally don't like ranches I just,ep078
378,kind of looks like a big rectangle to me,ep078
381,so I'm not a fan and there's only one,ep078
384,car garage I know I know but the garage,ep078
387,is long enough where you can actually,ep078
390,fit two cars tandem lis have to look at,ep078
393,something that Kayla likes I mean this,ep078
396,is what she wanted I never gave you,ep078
399,guess I'll have to turn compromise these,ep078
402,finishes are really nice I'm not a fan,ep078
405,of feed so it looks like something out,ep078
408,of battle start the dryer I like the,ep078
411,dark wood oh I love it isn't it pretty,ep078
414,what is this space this is your dining,ep078
417,room you know it's open so there's no,ep078
420,formal dining room,ep078
423,no this is the dining room your living,ep078
426,room is downstairs,ep078
429,I was hoping more for a formal dining,ep078
432,room it's bright in here I like it is,ep078
435,where I like the natural sunlight Wow,ep078
438,what do you think common issues are,ep078
441,great this is the granite countertops I,ep078
444,was looking at once so that's pretty,ep078
447,cool I love the cabinets I love the,ep078
450,stainless steel I love the countertops,ep078
453,was my dream kitchen it has the white,ep078
456,cabinets I think it could work amazingly,ep078
459,oh this is cute oh it's cute so pretty,ep078
462,decent size yeah it is,ep078
465,I think the dogs would like it it is,ep078
468,nice that we wouldn't have to fence an,ep078
471,entire yard,ep078
474,yeah and that saves money and a place,ep078
477,for your hammock look those even though,ep078
480,oh good work yeah,ep078
483,back inside they take a look at the full,ep078
486,bag that's clean it's clean that's a,ep078
489,passing a brand-new and the two guest,ep078
492,rooms oh my goodness this is tiny,ep078
495,Wow maybe this is the room for the dogs,ep078
498,yeah oh wow so the master this is small,ep078
501,king-size bed is like right I don't give,ep078
504,you enough room for the king-size of it,ep078
507,if you do it that way okay still think,ep078
510,that I like for you,ep078
513,that's Caleb's clothes and now I need a,ep078
516,closet but there is an additional closet,ep078
519,right outside the room okay actually,ep078
522,could work yeah there's a lot of extra,ep078
525,space there even though the rooms tend,ep078
528,to be small in this house the closet,ep078
531,space is big enough for both of us which,ep078
534,is a big deal next they head downstairs,ep078
537,to the living room area it's definitely,ep078
540,nice it's finished and I don't think we,ep078
543,would change anything that's move-in,ep078
546,ready so that's pretty cool,ep078
549,[Applause],ep078
552,tell me what your thoughts are I love,ep078
555,the outside I think it's nice to work,ep078
558,well it just looks like a cute little,ep078
561,house when you pull up the kitchen it's,ep078
564,not just that's exactly what we were,ep078
567,that's like everything on our checklist,ep078
570,everything is moving ready whoo the yard,ep078
573,is nice I think the biggest concern is,ep078
576,the size of all the rooms and there's no,ep078
579,formal dining room which is something I,ep078
582,really wanted if I do find something,ep078
585,with more square footage I believe that,ep078
588,it's going to cost more do you have any,ep078
591,room in your budget if we want to go up,ep078
594,the girls have a type by day they're,ep078
597,gonna have to start making some,ep078
600,compromises because they can't get,ep078
603,everything that they want for in their,ep078
606,price range I think we can find a little,ep078
609,bit of wiggle room I'm not so sure I'm,ep078
612,not sure what tisha and Caroline are,ep078
615,trying to do but our budget is firm at,ep078
618,"130,000 I really don't want a wiggle on",ep078
621,that because we have to keep it within,ep078
624,reality so tshis found another place,ep078
627,that fits the budget but Calum might,ep078
630,have to compromise on stuff,ep078
633,today we're gonna look at a cape,ep078
636,cod-style house i know you don't want to,ep078
639,create but wait until you see the,ep078
642,surprise I have for you,ep078
645,Hey,ep078
648,Caroline and Kayla have opposing wish,ep078
651,lists on their hunt for a home in,ep078
654,Syracuse with 130 thousand dollars to,ep078
657,spend they've seen a raised ranch that,ep078
660,Kayla loved but it didn't have the,ep078
663,formal dining room she wants and,ep078
666,Caroline would prefer a cape cod-style,ep078
669,place today we're gonna look at a cape,ep078
672,cod-style house now you know three,ep078
675,bedrooms one half bath 1:29 9 I know you,ep078
678,don't want a cape but wait until you see,ep078
681,the surprise I have for you ok better be,ep078
684,good no not my ranch I told you that,ep078
687,incredible then it'll be great in the,ep078
690,wintertime as the snow we don't have to,ep078
693,go and scrape off the car alright come,ep078
696,on let's go see what else I got for you,ep078
699,I will make just right here honestly,ep078
702,that's not perfect okay this is very,ep078
705,yellow it's very yellow right but you,ep078
708,can always paint that that's you we can,ep078
711,decide all that later let's go come on,ep078
714,we're gonna look at your formal dining,ep078
717,room this is a nice size around well you,ep078
720,could fit a good-sized table in here for,ep078
723,"your 1,000 family members it's very",ep078
726,yellow though still very these people,ep078
729,really love them some yellow I feel like,ep078
732,I'm in a maze of sunflowers if we do,ep078
735,decide on this house that is the first,ep078
738,thing to go wow wow this is pretty nice,ep078
741,I like this is pretty nice as white,ep078
744,cabinets I like the white cabinets,ep078
747,brighten up are these grim no they're,ep078
750,not but make to look like granite okay,ep078
753,down the hall they see a half bath and a,ep078
756,guest room then we could turn this into,ep078
759,pet room for the dogs maybe we'll see I,ep078
762,do like this sliding glass door and,ep078
765,snappy oh yeah Wow,ep078
768,wow that's a big yard oh my gosh this is,ep078
771,amazing when you walk out into the deck,ep078
774,and see the backyard,ep078
777,it's more than I envisioned there's room,ep078
780,for a hammock there's room for my garden,ep078
783,I do notice there's no fence oh yeah,ep078
786,there is no offense that's kind of a,ep078
789,concern yep,ep078
792,so that adds to the budget back inside,ep078
795,on the second floor they take a look at,ep078
798,the full bath and a bedroom I see,ep078
801,slanted ceilings definitely feels a,ep078
804,little claustrophobic okay Kayla doesn't,ep078
807,like Cape Cod's because of the slanted,ep078
810,roof so when we walked in and they were,ep078
813,slanted roofs upstairs I knew she was,ep078
816,gonna say something about that,ep078
819,I don't like Cape Cod's in this house,ep078
822,didn't really change my mind on that,ep078
825,would this be the master it could be,ep078
828,both of the rooms are very similar in,ep078
831,size okay do you think hangers would fit,ep078
834,I don't it's enough to come all the way,ep078
837,down here I don't think it'd work okay,ep078
840,well let's go look at the other bedroom,ep078
843,and see if you feel the same way still,ep078
846,has my feelings I'm guessing this is,ep078
849,gonna be this house virtually has zero,ep078
852,closet space in it I really think the,ep078
855,closets in this house are gonna be a,ep078
858,deal-breaker,ep078
861,[Music],ep078
864,what do you guys think love the two-car,ep078
867,garage,ep078
870,absolutely and that yard is huge if that,ep078
873,kitchen is like move-in-ready,ep078
876,you don't need to do anything to that I,ep078
879,agree I think closet space is the number,ep078
882,one that involved yeah clonk spacing the,ep078
885,size of the rooms up definitely on rooms,ep078
888,I'm disappointed by the ceilings that's,ep078
891,my least favorite thing about a Cape Cod,ep078
894,and this house has them it does make me,ep078
897,sad to not have the ranch that's what I,ep078
900,had dreamed of,ep078
903,so now tshis found another ranch for,ep078
906,Kayla but she might not like the price,ep078
909,the original price is 189 nine it's been,ep078
912,reduced to 149 9,ep078
915,[Music],ep078
918,Kaela and Caroline are on the hunt for a,ep078
921,home that has a big yard for their pets,ep078
924,"with a strict $130,000 budget they've",ep078
927,seen two homes with good-sized yards a,ep078
930,raised ranch for Kayla that was move-in,ep078
933,ready but didn't have a formal dining,ep078
936,room and a Cape Cod for Caroline that,ep078
939,they both felt was a little small so,ep078
942,today their agents lined up a bigger,ep078
945,home today we are going to see a,ep078
948,split-level ranch,ep078
951,hmm the original price is 189 nine it's,ep078
954,been reduced to 149 now I know it's over,ep078
957,your budget but this has a lot more,ep078
960,"square footage almost 1,800 square feet",ep078
963,Wow we have a two-car garage for you a,ep078
966,text Wow do you think there'd be any,ep078
969,wiggle room on the price at all hmm,ep078
972,there could be okay so tell me what you,ep078
975,think I don't love the price but it's,ep078
978,cute I'm really glad that tisha was able,ep078
981,to show us a ranch it's kind of,ep078
984,symmetrical I think it pops well I feel,ep078
987,like for me this house is too square,ep078
990,it's just a big rectangle and I feel,ep078
993,like a robot,ep078
996,Wow they wouldn't know it's really nice,ep078
999,off the living room is a formal dining,ep078
1002,area and it is a good-size room there's,ep078
1005,potential yep what do you guys think of,ep078
1008,the floors I like the floors,ep078
1011,next to the dining area is a sunroom Wow,ep078
1014,it's very bright and we're expecting and,ep078
1017,it's kind of a nice little bonus that is,ep078
1020,a nice bonus yeah Wow it's pretty big,ep078
1023,this is pretty big and I like the white,ep078
1026,fence it is a perfect backyard you know,ep078
1029,fence around it garden spot for Kayla I,ep078
1032,don't see any trees for a hammock,ep078
1035,I don't either maybe we'll have to get a,ep078
1038,hammock that stands up by here right,ep078
1041,something that's it I was gonna suggest,ep078
1044,back inside they check out the kitchen,ep078
1047,oh my oh my godness what year could be -,ep078
1050,talking - okay this is it,ep078
1053,this feels expensive I feel like I'm,ep078
1056,Thanksgiving the turkey would just,ep078
1059,disown right go my good oh my goodness,ep078
1062,that's disgusting you might have to,ep078
1065,split her ton in there what money I mean,ep078
1068,I'm not the budget person kayla is but,ep078
1071,seeing how much money we'd have to put,ep078
1074,into this kitchen on top of what the,ep078
1077,price of this house is I'm kind of,ep078
1080,swinging over to the budget side here,ep078
1083,this is the first time that I've seen,ep078
1086,Caroline got my side and concerned about,ep078
1089,the budget which is refreshing something,ep078
1092,I like to see this house does need some,ep078
1095,updates but the price did drop from 189,ep078
1098,to 149 and there may be some wiggle room,ep078
1101,in there so I have to do some digging,ep078
1104,and find out please keep an open mind,ep078
1107,because you not seeing the second floor,ep078
1110,yet so let's go take a look at that what,ep078
1113,are these those are your extra storage,ep078
1116,closet oh that's nice see the master,ep078
1119,oh it's like a walking closet I know wow,ep078
1122,yeah this is definitely making me happy,ep078
1125,oh it's an ensuite that's awesome I mean,ep078
1128,it definitely needs Oh update it's kind,ep078
1131,of a cool little surprise definitely we,ep078
1134,could make it work for now down the hall,ep078
1137,they see another full bath tisha yeah oh,ep078
1140,my god I feel like I'm in the middle of,ep078
1143,a grapefruit this is so peach wow that's,ep078
1146,wow this is a complete gut job oh my,ep078
1149,goodness there's not one thing that,ep078
1152,would stay next door they see two guest,ep078
1155,rooms I love the size of the bedroom is,ep078
1158,huge and the closets there's like ten of,ep078
1161,them in each room it's insane the,ep078
1164,[Music],ep078
1167,bedrooms in this house in the closet,ep078
1170,space in this house the yard there's a,ep078
1173,lot of things that we really like about,ep078
1176,it the 2-part garage just huge but then,ep078
1179,we have the kitchen which needs a,ep078
1182,complete Renault and the bathroom,ep078
1185,upstairs I actually really like this,ep078
1188,house,ep078
1191,I'm not happy with the budget or the,ep078
1194,price of it and then when you add up all,ep078
1197,the things that we would want to ideally,ep078
1200,do to it it kind of makes your head spin,ep078
1203,but now it's time for Kayla and Caroline,ep078
1206,to make a decision and since none of the,ep078
1209,houses meet their whole wish list,ep078
1212,they've called in Caroline's mom for,ep078
1215,help in picking Lani,ep078
1218,all right ladies sounds like you have a,ep078
1221,decision to make,ep078
1224,[Music],ep078
1227,Caroline and Kayla have been living with,ep078
1230,Caroline's mom while they hunt for a,ep078
1233,home of their own in Syracuse New York,ep078
1236,with a strict 130 thousand dollar budget,ep078
1239,they've seen several options now it's,ep078
1242,decision time so tell me about him,ep078
1245,their first options listed at one,ep078
1248,hundred and twenty nine thousand nine,ep078
1251,hundred dollars what did you think of,ep078
1254,the race ranch I know that's more my,ep078
1257,style,ep078
1260,it's definitely not the worst thing I've,ep078
1263,seen in the world inside a kitchen was,ep078
1266,amazing closet space is like there's no,ep078
1269,doubt in my mind we can fit all of our,ep078
1272,clothes into that house backyard decent,ep078
1275,size I mean we would only have to put in,ep078
1278,a couple hundred dollars worth of,ep078
1281,fencing the bedrooms were on the small,ep078
1284,side hmm,ep078
1287,I just don't know if it has the space,ep078
1290,for us and for animals the next stone,ep078
1293,they saw also listed at 129 nine was a,ep078
1296,cape cod-style home like it did have the,ep078
1299,slanted ceilings because it's a cape cod,ep078
1302,but it's a beautiful backyard we would,ep078
1305,have to add a fence if that's what we,ep078
1308,picked but I had white cabinets yeah,ep078
1311,kitchen the kitchen was beautiful a,ep078
1314,two-car attached garage awesome I think,ep078
1317,for me the closet space was the biggest,ep078
1320,thing just because we have so many,ep078
1323,clothes between the two of us that,ep078
1326,potentially could be a deal-breaker for,ep078
1329,us the last house they saw was a,ep078
1332,split-level ranch priced over budget at,ep078
1335,"$149,900 I felt the curb appeal was",ep078
1338,great when you walk up they've,ep078
1341,maintained it so well oh my gosh the,ep078
1344,amount of closets in this house is,ep078
1347,insane,ep078
1350,and every closet was big definitely yeah,ep078
1353,and there's a fully fenced yard but 100%,ep078
1356,fence and on one side there was a pool,ep078
1359,but let me walk into the kitchen and the,ep078
1362,bathrooms and and you're in the 1950s,ep078
1365,this house is over our budget plus the,ep078
1368,bathrooms plus the kitchens I'm not,ep078
1371,really sure how we would swing all that,ep078
1374,all right lady sounds like you have a,ep078
1377,decision to make kind of think I might,ep078
1380,like the Cape Cod really me too from the,ep078
1383,outside I immediately fell in love with,ep078
1386,it I think it really meets our needs we,ep078
1389,have the yard in the kitchen and the,ep078
1392,two-car garage,ep078
1395,two-car garage is key and that's in the,ep078
1398,budget in the budget so we go call,ep078
1401,Keisha that's got Isha,ep078
1404,but this looks really good I'm excited,ep078
1407,we moved in about a month ago it's so,ep078
1410,nice to have more space for our family,ep078
1413,and our four animals,ep078
1416,the original asking price was 129 nine,ep078
1419,men with a little negotiation we got it,ep078
1422,down to 120 to five I am so happy with,ep078
1425,the price that we got this home before,ep078
1428,because that left room in our budget,ep078
1431,purchased a few little upgrades make it,ep078
1434,our own,ep078
1437,can you reach mr. beauty we've changed,ep078
1440,the color of the dining room in the,ep078
1443,living room we changed it from that,ep078
1446,sunflower yellow to a pretty blue new,ep078
1449,furniture we've ordered new dining table,ep078
1452,the closet situation is still something,ep078
1455,we're still trying to kind of come up,ep078
1458,with a solution for so far it's okay,ep078
1461,still a work in progress,ep078
1464,yeah I'm still adjusting to the slanted,ep078
1467,ceilings but with the other things that,ep078
1470,this house had to offer it's a small,ep078
1473,price to pay I think it's really nice to,ep078
1476,have that pet room right now with the,ep078
1479,sliding glass door we were also able to,ep078
1482,fit a desk in there so it kind of works,ep078
1485,as an office and a room for the pets and,ep078
1488,other things okay I love the yard that's,ep078
1491,my favorite part hands down not only is,ep078
1494,good for us boats for our dogs as well,ep078
1497,with the money that we saved for the,ep078
1500,price of this house now we have the,ep078
1503,money to put a fence in hi ladies here,ep078
1506,we go,ep078
1509,[Applause],ep078
1512,it's really been wonderful having our,ep078
1515,own place we've had friends and family,ep078
1518,over all the time and it kind of helps,ep078
1521,us make this our home I agree it's just,ep078
1524,nice to fill it with people that we love,ep078
1527,[Music],ep078
12,[Music],ep079
15,Paul sighs Paul and Elissa are looking,ep079
18,to buy their first home and creative in,ep079
21,pool Austin Texas,ep079
24,I like the red door it's cute Melissa,ep079
27,loves older quirky bungalows I love the,ep079
30,French door,ep079
33,that's why I love it and she hates,ep079
36,carpet it would just get full of fur and,ep079
39,third and this is really thick carpet no,ep079
42,that's not usually a complaint,ep079
45,really Paul is focused on getting their,ep079
48,five pets out of his office,ep079
51,it could maybe work for an office but it,ep079
54,is pretty small what I have to share,ep079
57,that space with five pets but can they,ep079
60,get what they want where they want it,ep079
63,where are we this is blue gravel,ep079
66,[Music],ep079
69,go ahead and bring your hands to your,ep079
72,heart,ep079
75,Melissa I work for the state of Texas I,ep079
78,work in public health and I also teach,ep079
81,yoga exhale hands to the mat lower I'm,ep079
84,Paul and I'm a visual designer for,ep079
87,marching bands I designed all the,ep079
90,formations on the field Paul and I met,ep079
93,online about three years ago and we got,ep079
96,married about a year and a half ago,ep079
99,both transplants from the Northeast they,ep079
102,loved their chosen hometown of Austin,ep079
105,Texas our neighborhood is the hip arty,ep079
108,neighborhood we can walk to all kinds of,ep079
111,restaurants and coffee shops we're close,ep079
114,to downtown,ep079
117,keep stepping here the only thing that's,ep079
120,not cute their current living situation,ep079
123,we rent an adorable back house right now,ep079
126,that's a house in someone else's,ep079
129,backyard it's just a little too small,ep079
132,it's about 850 square feet we live here,ep079
135,with our dog dolly and we have four cats,ep079
138,Waldo Dexter Dylan and Donna she had two,ep079
141,cats and I had a dog and two cats when,ep079
144,we first met I said oh no I hope it,ep079
147,doesn't work out that's just too many,ep079
150,pets him stroking but it happened to get,ep079
153,more space for themselves and there are,ep079
156,five critters they're on the hunt for,ep079
159,their first home we were approved for a,ep079
162,"loan of up to $250,000 I really like",ep079
165,this one the swing on the porch I really,ep079
168,like a Craftsman style home but one,ep079
171,that's more on the modern side,ep079
174,especially on the inside too modern not,ep079
177,into it now I like it it looks like,ep079
180,you'd be a lot like wide open space I,ep079
183,like the open floor plan it just feels,ep079
186,like you have more room it's more,ep079
189,spacious I know,ep079
192,Alissa is not a big fan I feel like if,ep079
195,the kitchen is a mess I don't want to,ep079
198,see that from the living room it's so,ep079
201,cute look at the colors I would like a,ep079
204,bungalow style house built in the 50s or,ep079
207,60s or earlier lots of charm old wood,ep079
210,floors cute details look at all the,ep079
213,character,ep079
216,yeah I do like the charm I'd worry about,ep079
219,repairs yeah do that all I could I'm,ep079
222,going to have a place that doesn't need,ep079
225,any major renovations I don't think,ep079
228,either of us are very handy with that,ep079
231,stuff we can paint and whatnot but we,ep079
234,just want to move in location-wise they,ep079
237,want to be as close to the action as,ep079
240,possible I grew up in the suburbs and I,ep079
243,did not like it I would love to stay,ep079
246,closer to the city but I understand that,ep079
249,with our budget we have to be a little,ep079
252,flexible but I don't want to live,ep079
255,somewhere that I'll have a very long,ep079
258,commute ELISA would like a dedicated,ep079
261,yoga space and Paul needs his own office,ep079
264,I could have it to you by later today,ep079
267,Dylan watch how I work from home so it,ep079
270,designated space so the cats aren't,ep079
273,crawling all over that would be ideal on,ep079
276,the fridge sure they'd like a larger,ep079
279,kitchen with a gas stove and since they,ep079
282,have so many pets they want a house with,ep079
285,no carpet my real deal breaker though is,ep079
288,the cookie cutter nineties everything's,ep079
291,brown wood work I know I just can't,ep079
294,stand that I don't know why that was,ep079
297,ever a thing okay good girl good girl,ep079
300,dolly good our dog dolly needs a yard we,ep079
303,have a little tiny yard right now I'd,ep079
306,like to get her more space to run around,ep079
309,rounding out their wish list is a,ep079
312,two-car garage and a dedicated outdoor,ep079
315,space for the cats,ep079
318,we'd like a screened-in patio patio they,ep079
321,call it screened-in porch for the cat,ep079
324,we're so excited about buying a house,ep079
327,and also totally frightened I grew up,ep079
330,living in apartments in my immediate,ep079
333,family and I'm the first person to buy a,ep079
336,house and it's more exciting than scary,ep079
339,first up a modern farmhouse Ranch close,ep079
342,to downtown it's definitely not a,ep079
345,craftsman not much of a porch or,ep079
348,anything out front yeah it doesn't have,ep079
351,those bungalow touches that I like but,ep079
354,it's cute I don't see a garage here's,ep079
357,the house we're going to see today was,ep079
360,built in 1970 oh I like that,ep079
363,but there is no garage and we really,ep079
366,wanted that for the cat boxes well the,ep079
369,price is two hundred and thirty-five,ep079
372,thousand dollars that's in our budget,ep079
375,yeah working with first-time homebuyers,ep079
378,like Paul and ELISA is they're really,ep079
381,not aware of what's available in the,ep079
384,market so sometimes that's kind of a,ep079
387,culture shock for them to see what is,ep079
390,available and how much it costs versus,ep079
393,what they want kind of small but it's,ep079
396,nice I like the color of this room it's,ep079
399,like a light gray I match this wall,ep079
402,though right yeah matches my favorite,ep079
405,cat what do you think of the hardwood,ep079
408,floors are they hardwood they look like,ep079
411,vinyl plank,ep079
414,they don't fool me easy to clean and,ep079
417,these windows are fantastic the cats,ep079
420,would love them I really didn't like,ep079
423,that I don't love how open it is,ep079
426,if the front door was open you could,ep079
429,probably see my dirty dishes from across,ep079
432,the street I know this it doesn't like,ep079
435,the open concept but I think it being,ep079
438,open really makes it seem bigger than it,ep079
441,is like these countertops it's not,ep079
444,exactly what I had in mind for my,ep079
447,kitchen counters but it looks cool what,ep079
450,are you thinking these shelves here I,ep079
453,love them actually I think they're,ep079
456,really nice yeah I really like that yes,ep079
459,a gas stove just what you want that is,ep079
462,just that's really important now I,ep079
465,thought there's a separate eating area,ep079
468,right off the kitchen it's kind of tight,ep079
471,so this is just a two-person closet,ep079
474,there that closet is your laundry room,ep079
477,I thought it would be a pantry if it's,ep079
480,not a pantry where do we put our food,ep079
483,there isn't that much cabinet space here,ep079
486,you can also use those shelves over,ep079
489,there just having like cereal boxes and,ep079
492,just make sure you buy pretty packages,ep079
495,watch your step guys we need some new,ep079
498,stairs I love these big old trees yeah,ep079
501,the defense would definitely need work,ep079
504,and the neighbors are right there,ep079
507,picture it like a six-foot privacy fence,ep079
510,with these big old trees this would be a,ep079
513,really nice private backyard then we,ep079
516,could design our dream screened-in patio,ep079
519,all additional costs though,ep079
522,back inside they see the first bathroom,ep079
525,on the way to the bedrooms it's a little,ep079
528,small it's very small it's not big,ep079
531,enough for yoga I don't think it has,ep079
534,yeah this is no good we'll just get full,ep079
537,of fern,ep079
540,yeah with five pets and this is really,ep079
543,thick carpet no that's not usually a,ep079
546,complaint really you can balance on one,ep079
549,foot in here it could maybe work for an,ep079
552,office maybe without having the space,ep079
555,for the cat box itself would I have to,ep079
558,share that space with five pets it's,ep079
561,pretty inconvenient they check out,ep079
564,another bedroom and the master this is,ep079
567,the master bedroom,ep079
570,it's the biggest buy a little and an,ep079
573,ensuite bathroom oh it's nicely updated,ep079
576,like the first bathroom just like the,ep079
579,first bathroom I don't love it I don't,ep079
582,hate it it's okay,ep079
585,it's not a craftsman it's not a bungalow,ep079
588,but it is cute,ep079
591,my commute won't be so bad from here,ep079
594,about 20 minutes maybe a little bit more,ep079
597,with traffic it's quite a bit of work we,ep079
600,got to do outside a new fence and the,ep079
603,back steps I like that there's an office,ep079
606,space but it is pretty small I don't,ep079
609,know where we put the cat boxes and then,ep079
612,carpet can be throws we could build a,ep079
615,back patio and everything litter box in,ep079
618,the screened-in yes yeah I don't know,ep079
621,how much that's gonna cost,ep079
624,we don't want a lot of renovations so,ep079
627,their agent lines up another option but,ep079
630,in a location that might be outside,ep079
633,their idea of cool Robert where are we,ep079
636,this is Pflugerville,ep079
639,can we get one of those chocolate chip,ep079
642,cookies absolutely,ep079
645,Paul and Alisa love living in artsy,ep079
648,Austin's and are hoping to find a home,ep079
651,"here in their $250,000 budget",ep079
654,she likes quirky bungalows while he,ep079
657,prefers a craftsman with modern touches,ep079
660,I love a culture in the middle of the,ep079
663,day so far they've seen a modern,ep079
666,farmhouse close to downtown Alissa,ep079
669,thought charm in the kitchen and,ep079
672,potential in the backyard but Paul,ep079
675,didn't like that the house didn't have a,ep079
678,garage so today their agent has lined up,ep079
681,a place with the garage they're looking,ep079
684,for just outside their target area it's,ep079
687,a highway right there it's not a crass,ep079
690,name but might have some modern finishes,ep079
693,inside it is not my cute little bungalow,ep079
696,are y'all doing it yeah Robert where are,ep079
699,we this is blue gourville this is north,ep079
702,of central Austin it's an easy commute,ep079
705,you have the highway right here and it's,ep079
708,pretty fast now we can hear it yeah well,ep079
711,the little white noise never hurt,ep079
714,anybody,ep079
717,this is really in your budget its 239 5,ep079
720,it's perfect perfect let's go in and,ep079
723,take a look okay nice and bright in here,ep079
726,yeah I like the cathedral-like ceilings,ep079
729,yes I look like we'd have to do much,ep079
732,work too we can just move right in,ep079
735,I don't love the tiles easy to clean,ep079
738,with the pets,ep079
741,yeah good with pets they've updated the,ep079
744,kitchen it's a little bit bigger than,ep079
747,what we have now so that's good lack is,ep079
750,really sharp don't love these cabinets,ep079
753,but we could paint them is this gas it,ep079
756,is gas check out that oven it's a,ep079
759,convection oven I love that there's a,ep079
762,dining area over here and it's not in,ep079
765,the living space what do you think of,ep079
768,these floors Phil too much Brown for me,ep079
771,these tiles would have to go immediately,ep079
774,they're just a total eyesore,ep079
777,it's been upgraded marble countertops,ep079
780,I like those countertops trench think,ep079
783,huh here's the secondary bedroom carpets,ep079
786,to all the bedrooms some carpets they do,ep079
789,have carpet,ep079
792,I was thinking from my yoga space I was,ep079
795,hoping to have a room without carpet you,ep079
798,can always pull the carpet of it but,ep079
801,hardwood floors down that's more work to,ep079
804,do maybe I'm not this would make a great,ep079
807,office for me and this house has the,ep079
810,two-car garage so we don't have to make,ep079
813,one of these secondary bedrooms full of,ep079
816,litter boxes right let's go look at the,ep079
819,master bedroom,ep079
822,whoo so how do I it's a little bit,ep079
825,bigger than our bedroom now I like the,ep079
828,ceilings if you said a nice feel,ep079
831,bathrooms right off it I really like,ep079
834,these countertops,ep079
837,and this vanity is kind of cool it kind,ep079
840,of has an antiquey style with the knobs,ep079
843,and these details on the sides here,ep079
846,comes a shower,ep079
849,oh try it on ball yeah I think it's,ep079
852,definitely big enough what do you think,ep079
855,of those giant tiles it's really brown,ep079
858,tile here tell on the floor and then the,ep079
861,granite it's all kind of weird but it's,ep079
864,all done and it's new they head outside,ep079
867,to the yard this is not a screened-in,ep079
870,patio but I see there's this space so if,ep079
873,we wanted to build one one day a dolly,ep079
876,would really have plenty of room to run,ep079
879,around here it's all fenced in but that,ep079
882,house up on the hill over there it's,ep079
885,like they're looking right into our,ep079
888,house you can always plant trees it,ep079
891,would take some work I didn't really,ep079
894,like the kitchen,ep079
897,it wasn't the open concept that Paul,ep079
900,wanted but there was still a little bit,ep079
903,of opening so it was good compromise I,ep079
906,really like that there's the two-car,ep079
909,garage the cat litter boxes can go out,ep079
912,there well we might have to change out,ep079
915,one of the carpet,ep079
918,appropriate for yoga the space is good,ep079
921,then I really don't like that tile I,ep079
924,want to change it right away and take up,ep079
927,a tile floor it can't be an easy thing,ep079
930,how do you even do it,ep079
933,sledgehammer Jack and I'm done I'm not,ep079
936,doing that it's just so far and it's in,ep079
939,the middle of nowhere we really want to,ep079
942,be close to downtown so Robert comes,ep079
945,through with the place closer to,ep079
948,downtown but it might be a hard sell,ep079
951,give it a chance I've been telling you,ep079
954,new construction has its advantages,ep079
957,[Music],ep079
960,you only have a show in a week we're,ep079
963,just trying to clean it up Paul he,ep079
966,designs marching band formations for,ep079
969,local high schools and wife Alyssa are,ep079
972,ready to buy their first home in Austin,ep079
975,Texas for themselves and their five pets,ep079
978,with two hundred and fifty thousand,ep079
981,dollars to spend they've seen a,ep079
984,well-priced modern farmhouse near,ep079
987,downtown,ep079
990,he loved the updated touches and she,ep079
993,loved the charm but the house lacked a,ep079
996,garage then they saw a ranch just,ep079
999,outside of their target area the house,ep079
1002,had a two-car garage and spacious,ep079
1005,interior but Paul didn't like the,ep079
1008,renovations needed and Alyssa felt it,ep079
1011,was too far from central Austin today,ep079
1014,they're back near downtown at a home,ep079
1017,their agent things might fit their needs,ep079
1020,I've got a construction here Robert very,ep079
1023,noisy oh this is not a permanent,ep079
1026,situation just keep that in mind I'm not,ep079
1029,sure why Roberts showing us new,ep079
1032,construction I really wanted an old cute,ep079
1035,house with lots of character and I've,ep079
1038,always felt like new construction,ep079
1041,doesn't have character it's not a,ep079
1044,bungalow well it's about the size of a,ep079
1047,"bungalow it's just over 1,300 square",ep079
1050,feet,ep079
1053,give it a chance I've been telling you a,ep079
1056,new construction has its advantages and,ep079
1059,it's 242 thousand dollars listen budget,ep079
1062,that's up there but we could do that all,ep079
1065,right let's take a look at it oh this is,ep079
1068,nice there's nothing like that new house,ep079
1071,smell it is really nice but it's also,ep079
1074,very open if there was like a dirty,ep079
1077,plate on the counter you would see it as,ep079
1080,soon as you walked in you know we just,ep079
1083,have to wash the plate these floors are,ep079
1086,really nice are they've real wood,ep079
1089,this is engineered hardwood new kitchen,ep079
1092,is really nice to cook in look at that,ep079
1095,huge countertop you know it's not too,ep079
1098,much bigger than our kitchen now but it,ep079
1101,has a whole other chunk of counter,ep079
1104,counter space it's nice I love that,ep079
1107,backsplash a man just calls eyes I like,ep079
1110,the white cabinets and I like how tall,ep079
1113,they are but they don't have knobs or,ep079
1116,handles that's an easy fix you can hurt,ep079
1119,yourself Paul yeah call someone to do,ep079
1122,that Electric is gas of,ep079
1125,yes is not available in this,ep079
1128,neighborhood these new modern electric,ep079
1131,stoves are really responsive to,ep079
1134,temperature changes so you might find,ep079
1137,that you really like this stove I don't,ep079
1140,think I am going away to I'd really,ep079
1143,prefer gas let's go check out the master,ep079
1146,it is a carpeted master bedroom but it's,ep079
1149,new carpet it's really small in here we,ep079
1152,have windows over here we can't have the,ep079
1155,bit on the windowed wall well I don't,ep079
1158,think there's a room too small for,ep079
1161,newlyweds is there maybe this one yes,ep079
1164,let's check out the bathroom love the,ep079
1167,tile I like that it goes into the shower,ep079
1170,- this is good Robert I like this this,ep079
1173,room is the study so it doesn't count as,ep079
1176,one of the did not count as one of the,ep079
1179,three bedrooms huh nice extra space I,ep079
1182,like the French doors I love the French,ep079
1185,doors a bungalow touch that's why I love,ep079
1188,it it could be an office space for me or,ep079
1191,yoga room they move on to the second,ep079
1194,full bath it's a good size for a second,ep079
1197,bathroom yeah it's got a great tile,ep079
1200,bathtub too and that can be good for,ep079
1203,resale too because to a family they're,ep079
1206,going to want a bathtub for a child to,ep079
1209,take a bath in especially if it's a,ep079
1212,young child mm-hmm just like the other,ep079
1215,one it's white on white on white I like,ep079
1218,that it matches the other one now yeah,ep079
1221,except the floor is different the other,ep079
1224,one had that cool marble floor don't,ep079
1227,mind that the white on white on white,ep079
1230,it's a lot of white it's very,ep079
1233,overwhelming I like to be the whitest,ep079
1236,thing in the bathroom,ep079
1239,they see two guest rooms finally wood,ep079
1242,floor in the bedroom this is great,ep079
1245,that's a cool sheet room yeah I like,ep079
1248,that it's not just a box yeah this is a,ep079
1251,great room nice outdoor space that we,ep079
1254,were talking about stuff screened in but,ep079
1257,I know we're still in the City of Austin,ep079
1260,but it feels very suburban out here I,ep079
1263,can just see all the houses and the,ep079
1266,neighbors are really close they can see,ep079
1269,right into our yard you can build in,ep079
1272,privacy with bushes and trees I do like,ep079
1275,that we don't have to do any renovations,ep079
1278,we can move right in,ep079
1281,I'm surprised how much I like the new,ep079
1284,construction there are a lot of features,ep079
1287,like the tile in the master bathroom and,ep079
1290,the French doors in the study that I,ep079
1293,think are really cute has a hardwood,ep079
1296,forest in which we like I don't like the,ep079
1299,open concept it's so after seeing what,ep079
1302,Austin has to offer it won't be an easy,ep079
1305,choice for Paul and Alissa it may come,ep079
1308,down to location garage and the age of,ep079
1311,the home where are you leaning,ep079
1314,[Music],ep079
1317,come on Paul and Alyssa have seen how,ep079
1320,much house they can get in sought after,ep079
1323,Austin Texas for their budget of two,ep079
1326,hundred and fifty thousand dollars now,ep079
1329,it's time to decide what do you think of,ep079
1332,that 1970 modern farmhouse Christ at 235,ep079
1335,it is the most affordable it was really,ep079
1338,charming when you walked up and it had,ep079
1341,that red front door that was something I,ep079
1344,didn't like okay you can see right into,ep079
1347,the kitchen from the front door you do,ep079
1350,want an eat-in kitchen and it was kind,ep079
1353,of locked off so it wasn't all open I,ep079
1356,like that about it and that was one of,ep079
1359,my favorite backyards and then those,ep079
1362,giant beautiful old trees I just loved,ep079
1365,those but I don't want to be on the,ep079
1368,internet all day like figuring out how,ep079
1371,to build stairs and also there's no,ep079
1374,garage what do you think about that,ep079
1377,ranch in Pflugerville it was priced at,ep079
1380,239 five my commute would be like 45,ep079
1383,minutes it didn't have that Kent,ep079
1386,bungalow charm I was looking for it does,ep079
1389,have the rooms,ep079
1392,it's definitely room for office space,ep079
1395,the garage for the cat boxes and the,ep079
1398,kitchen was updated but it wasn't really,ep079
1401,my style I really liked that it had a,ep079
1404,gas range one room could be my yoga,ep079
1407,space right but you'd want to rip up the,ep079
1410,carpet I'm sure I don't really think,ep079
1413,that's ideal I just want to move in what,ep079
1416,do you think about the new construction,ep079
1419,priced pretty up there at 242 and it's,ep079
1422,the most expensive of all the words we,ep079
1425,saw I was really surprised by how much I,ep079
1428,liked it not every single bedroom was,ep079
1431,carpeted but I didn't like how open the,ep079
1434,kitchen is they just have to put things,ep079
1437,away you know that's easy to say now but,ep079
1440,sometimes you don't feel like scrubbing,ep079
1443,pots and pans it also was a gas range I,ep079
1446,really don't like that I really like to,ep079
1449,get your office space but now master,ep079
1452,bedroom was just really small where are,ep079
1455,you leaning,ep079
1458,that modern farmhouse had a lot of the,ep079
1461,things on my list but I think there are,ep079
1464,just too many projects I think that the,ep079
1467,new construction is gonna be the best,ep079
1470,choice for us yeah that's definitely my,ep079
1473,choice it's missing a lot of the charm,ep079
1476,and character I was hoping to find but I,ep079
1479,can add it myself,ep079
1482,in decorating and stuff so let's put in,ep079
1485,an offer let's give Robert a call it's,ep079
1488,been a month since we closed down the,ep079
1491,house and we moved in a week ago they,ep079
1494,paid the full asking price for the home,ep079
1497,two hundred and forty two thousand,ep079
1500,dollars there wasn't much pasture in the,ep079
1503,home so to bring a little bit of charm,ep079
1506,we put these cute cabinet knobs in the,ep079
1509,kitchen cabinets and once we brought in,ep079
1512,some of our rugs and everything it's a,ep079
1515,lot cuter,ep079
1518,this office space is really working out,ep079
1521,well I get to work in my desk or play,ep079
1524,some guitar my favorite space in the,ep079
1527,house is my yoga room I can shut the,ep079
1530,door and just me my met her in there I,ep079
1533,wasn't into the open concept but I don't,ep079
1536,mind it so much because we've been,ep079
1539,trying really hard to keep it neat and,ep079
1542,clean I'm getting used to the electric,ep079
1545,stove I still don't love it but I'm,ep079
1548,working on it you have a garage all the,ep079
1551,cat boxes are out there their cat tree,ep079
1554,and we have the cat door and they can,ep079
1557,come and go as they please and they,ep079
1560,actually seem to really like it,ep079
1563,come on I think she's gonna like these,ep079
1566,plants when they get bigger to when they,ep079
1569,block the neighbors,ep079
1572,I had a compromise because the neighbors,ep079
1575,are really close but we did have a,ep079
1578,little skater come in and put up some,ep079
1581,trees and some shrubs and I think it's,ep079
1584,gonna work out yeah this backyards gonna,ep079
1587,be really nice it's about time to mow it,ep079
1590,yeah we can we have to buy a mower yeah,ep079
1593,I think I think we can do that now,ep079
1596,person this house was a great thing for,ep079
1599,us now that we have a little bit more,ep079
1602,space we can have friends and family,ep079
1605,visit so Lots could happen girl,ep079
1608,[Music],ep079
12,[Music],ep080
15,seriously that this this is perfection,ep080
18,this Denver couple recently moved their,ep080
21,family to Atlanta Georgia and are hoping,ep080
24,to find a perfect house filled with,ep080
27,southern charm this is your southern,ep080
30,sitting room but they have a long wish,ep080
33,list and very different opinions,ep080
36,I think the budgets fine I think you're,ep080
39,crazy the yard is flat but there's no,ep080
42,room for horses this is not my bright,ep080
45,white kitchen that I was looking for,ep080
48,again we hope we can fix all this,ep080
51,can they get on the same page and find,ep080
54,the right fit for their family if you,ep080
57,can make the rest of the house look like,ep080
60,this we might have a deal,ep080
63,[Music],ep080
66,all righty I'm kicking your booty let's,ep080
69,do this I'm Tom I'm an attorney I work,ep080
72,for a financial consulting firm and,ep080
75,Melissa and digital media director I,ep080
78,didn't work in an advertising agency,ep080
81,we've been together for seven years and,ep080
84,married for four now yes I knew that and,ep080
87,I totally knew that,ep080
90,really we've been together seven years,ep080
93,in our house is just us our two-year-old,ep080
96,son Tommy a dog and a catch so now,ep080
99,you're but things we like to do you know,ep080
102,we spend a lot of time around horses at,ep080
105,horse events tom is playing polo or,ep080
108,doing something involved with polo often,ep080
111,okay I'll take this spyridon yep perfect,ep080
114,unless it does what Melissa wants she's,ep080
117,very independent she's very driven,ep080
120,that's what attracted me to her you know,ep080
123,you forgot funny beautiful smart tom is,ep080
126,very stoic he is incredibly,ep080
129,family-oriented and loyal and my dog,ep080
132,they've recently moved here to Atlantic,ep080
135,from Denver to be closer to family I,ep080
138,really like Atlanta it's a such a green,ep080
141,city there's trees everywhere you look,ep080
144,you have this big beautiful amazing,ep080
147,vibrant city but yet you kind of feel,ep080
150,like you're in a neighborhood everywhere,ep080
153,now they just have to get out of,ep080
156,temporary housing and into a home of,ep080
159,their own,ep080
162,they're looking in the suburbs of,ep080
165,Mableton and Sandy Springs about 20,ep080
168,minutes from downtown Atlanta that one's,ep080
171,pretty what do you think the price of,ep080
174,this is I think this is probably more my,ep080
177,budget range not yours my budget is,ep080
180,"600,000 to put more money into this home",ep080
183,so we aren't moving again I prefer more,ep080
186,"to be in the $400,000 range",ep080
189,I'm not against doing some rehab but if,ep080
192,we're going to be at that price point of,ep080
195,600 like Melissa wants it better be done,ep080
198,oh look that one has a lot of columns,ep080
201,right it's really pretty,ep080
204,I really like the Greek Revival style I,ep080
207,like the big two-story columns a grand,ep080
210,entrance,ep080
213,moving to the south I really want to be,ep080
216,in a plantation-style I like that,ep080
219,regal state look they both agree on at,ep080
222,least four bedrooms a safe flat yard for,ep080
225,their son Tommy to play in and a,ep080
228,screened-in porch we don't really have,ep080
231,bugs in Denver and I'm a little bit,ep080
234,freaked out about how that's gonna play,ep080
237,out here in Atlanta so I definitely want,ep080
240,a place where I can be outside enjoy the,ep080
243,outside away from my environment,ep080
246,we'd like to entertain me when I have a,ep080
249,lot of family and friends over so a lot,ep080
252,of entertaining spaces holiday dinners,ep080
255,big dining room that's really important,ep080
258,to us and I really would like a big,ep080
261,white kitchen but the dark just feels a,ep080
264,little bit depressing because I play,ep080
267,polo I want to be able to keep my horses,ep080
270,at home however he would be willing to,ep080
273,board his horses at the Polo Club if,ep080
276,they can't find a space for them in,ep080
279,their new home Tom's list also includes,ep080
282,a finished basement with a bar and a,ep080
285,home office with some privacy,ep080
288,as far as compromising I predict Tom,ep080
291,will be compromising the most sadly,ep080
294,there's no prediction you never,ep080
297,compromise today their real estate agent,ep080
300,Karen is starting the couple off in the,ep080
303,suburb of Mapleton to look at a house,ep080
306,that's listed with a price tag closer -,ep080
309,Melissa's budget so this is a,ep080
312,traditional home which is the majority,ep080
315,of homes in Atlanta or traditional I,ep080
318,mean I'm really not crazy about that,ep080
321,tiny front porch and I really wanted,ep080
324,columns Karen it's not something that,ep080
327,we've been drawn to but I think we can,ep080
330,look at it depending on you know the,ep080
333,details and the price of this house so,ep080
336,the price of this house is 589 I know,ep080
339,that's a little bit outside of your,ep080
342,budget but I think there's room for,ep080
345,negotiations,ep080
348,I think the budgets fine I think you're,ep080
351,crazy let's take a look okay,ep080
354,oh yeah whoa right when you walk in kind,ep080
357,of a tight entryway here okay well right,ep080
360,off the front here you've got this bonus,ep080
363,room this could work for my office all,ep080
366,right let's get going,ep080
369,hardwood floors and then okay definitely,ep080
372,more like it oh my gosh this is,ep080
375,beautiful I love this room look how tall,ep080
378,the ceilings are in here Wow this,ep080
381,fireplace is fantastic okay now check,ep080
384,this out oh my gosh I am obsessed with,ep080
387,this kitchen,ep080
390,it's my white cabinet and there's even,ep080
393,kind of like this little distressing,ep080
396,thing on here you really love that nice,ep080
399,lots of lots of counter space for,ep080
402,cooking are you gonna cook that would be,ep080
405,great occasionally I can absolutely see,ep080
408,our son playing on the floor there,ep080
411,making cookies having friends and family,ep080
414,over it's it's exactly what I was,ep080
417,looking for they passed by the formal,ep080
420,dining room on their way out to the,ep080
423,porch Oh,ep080
426,screened-in porch yeah it's probably one,ep080
429,of the biggest ones I've ever seen and,ep080
432,it's a must in Atlanta with the bugs I,ep080
435,cannot do the bug thing so absolutely,ep080
438,have to have this this is like an,ep080
441,additional room okay well we've got a,ep080
444,huge yard let's go take a look this is,ep080
447,about almost an acre of land which is,ep080
450,really great for Atlanta I'm a little,ep080
453,bit worried about that ravine though I,ep080
456,mean that could be pretty dangerous is,ep080
459,there's really not a lot of room for a,ep080
462,Sun to play and that may be kind of a,ep080
465,problem for him I still don't get it any,ep080
468,land for my horses almost an acre is,ep080
471,great but where am I gonna wear my horse,ep080
474,is gonna eat,ep080
477,back inside they head up to the second,ep080
480,floor and see three bedrooms and two,ep080
483,full baths before heading into the,ep080
486,master wow this is a really nice sized,ep080
489,vaulted ceilings lots of light yeah this,ep080
492,is I mean it's a good size separate,ep080
495,counter spaces but this is really dated,ep080
498,this is not good I agree I agree this is,ep080
501,a problem,ep080
504,[Music],ep080
507,this is a really nice big open space,ep080
510,here wet bar nice bar area it's not a,ep080
513,bar it's definitely a good setup to make,ep080
516,a cocktail which i think is the,ep080
519,definition of a bar no definition of,ep080
522,bars a bar and a barstool okay walking,ep080
525,through this house there are a lot of,ep080
528,notes as of right now there has to be a,ep080
531,lot of convincing to make this a yes,ep080
534,they take a peek at another bedroom,ep080
537,and a media room before heading back up,ep080
540,to the main floor,ep080
543,[Music],ep080
546,so what did you like I mean of course I,ep080
549,loved this kitchen huge yard I'm a,ep080
552,little worried about that slope that's,ep080
555,for sure but don't forget I mean that,ep080
558,screened-in porch that was absolutely,ep080
561,amazing,ep080
564,so the price point that we're at I would,ep080
567,have expected maybe some more land for,ep080
570,the place of the horses no bar in the,ep080
573,basement I know you're right I mean for,ep080
576,the budget I did think we'd be able to,ep080
579,kind of get everything on our list with,ep080
582,a hefty client wish list Garin is,ep080
585,enlisting the help of her colleague to,ep080
588,show the next house hoping she'll have,ep080
591,better luck so I know it's not a Greek,ep080
594,Revival or a plantation but it is a,ep080
597,super cute cape cod-style definitely not,ep080
600,kind of what we're looking for,ep080
603,[Music],ep080
606,one two Thom and Melissa recently moved,ep080
609,their family from Denver Colorado and,ep080
612,"with a budget of $600,000 they're",ep080
615,looking for the perfect home in the,ep080
618,Atlanta Georgia area so far they've seen,ep080
621,a traditional-style home in Mapleton,ep080
624,that checked a lot of Melissa's wish,ep080
627,list but it lacked southern charm and,ep080
630,they didn't think the yard was very flat,ep080
633,for their son to play it or big enough,ep080
636,to board Tom's polo horses so today with,ep080
639,their agent Karen unavailable her,ep080
642,colleague Cara is showing them a home in,ep080
645,the highly desirable Sandy Springs,ep080
648,suburb so I know it's not a Greek,ep080
651,Revival or a plantation but it is a,ep080
654,super cute cape cod-style definitely not,ep080
657,kind of what we're looking for,ep080
660,well you are really really close to,ep080
663,downtown and the neighborhood just can't,ep080
666,be beat now it does have six bedrooms,ep080
669,four bathrooms and it's on the market,ep080
672,for six hundred and fourteen thousand,ep080
675,okay well let's go stop yes would you,ep080
678,take a look budgets fine especially if,ep080
681,it has everything we're looking for I,ep080
684,don't think I am cheap I think I am,ep080
687,frugal there should be a reason why,ep080
690,we're spending money just not spending,ep080
693,money willy-nilly so now I know it's not,ep080
696,the entrance that you wanted however,ep080
699,there's a really great formal dining,ep080
702,room and I know that that was on your,ep080
705,list yeah I mean the dining room does,ep080
708,have some nice finishes the crown,ep080
711,molding the chair rails molding that's a,ep080
714,really great style and the great part is,ep080
717,that it's right off of your kitchen so,ep080
720,to really make entertaining easy it is,ep080
723,my nice boy kitchen although I will say,ep080
726,the cabinets are a little older than I,ep080
729,would like like the granite countertops,ep080
732,I mean it's great storage but yeah I'd,ep080
735,want to knock that all down I mean look,ep080
738,this is like a shorter cook station here,ep080
741,I don't know what that is I mean yeah,ep080
744,that's that's gonna have to we can get,ep080
747,you a little bell,ep080
750,so now let's check out your backyard it,ep080
753,is beautiful come on out oh wow for our,ep080
756,son he loves to be outside this would be,ep080
759,great for him,ep080
762,the yard is flat fenced in for Tommy but,ep080
765,there's no room for horses however it's,ep080
768,really private and quiet out here so,ep080
771,it'll feel like you're not even in,ep080
774,Atlanta it's beautiful and peaceful but,ep080
777,I'm really disappointed this house,ep080
780,doesn't have a screened-in porch,ep080
783,so welcome this is your southern sitting,ep080
786,room,ep080
789,what is it southern sitting room so it's,ep080
792,really bright warm room where you can,ep080
795,welcome your guests in here it really,ep080
798,cozy bring them some iced tea this is,ep080
801,gorgeous this is by far my favorite room,ep080
804,of the house has a crown molding the,ep080
807,shutters,ep080
810,you like yeah and I think you're really,ep080
813,gonna like how this flows into what,ep080
816,could be a really great spacious office,ep080
819,this is great I'll be able to get all my,ep080
822,work done in here and close the doors,ep080
825,and keep everyone out well it's a,ep080
828,finished basement plenty of room for,ep080
831,things is there a bar that is the,ep080
834,question well let's see where we're,ep080
837,gonna put one shall we,ep080
840,this is a really big space though and,ep080
843,would be a great playroom for Tommy as,ep080
846,well as a great space to put your,ep080
849,workout gear yeah that's true,ep080
852,they make their way up to the second,ep080
855,floor and take a look at two spare rooms,ep080
858,and a bedroom off the master that's,ep080
861,really great for Tommy yeah this is a,ep080
864,really great size actually much bigger,ep080
867,nobody has now so now here's your master,ep080
870,wow this is actually pretty small for a,ep080
873,master this is pretty underwhelming so,ep080
876,now this is gonna be your master,ep080
879,bathroom yeah this is tiny and yeah no,ep080
882,this is not great,ep080
885,today's seller is pretty motivated so I,ep080
888,think there's definitely some,ep080
891,negotiation to be had especially knowing,ep080
894,that there's gonna be some updates that,ep080
897,are needed for them to really make this,ep080
900,their forever home,ep080
903,[Music],ep080
906,well I mean I think that there's,ep080
909,definitely some opportunity here again,ep080
912,if it comes down to the right price,ep080
915,how's my nice bright white kitchen that,ep080
918,family room is great nice and cozy have,ep080
921,some concerns with the master bedroom,ep080
924,upstairs is not really an ensuite right,ep080
927,now there are six bedrooms we could,ep080
930,maybe knock down a wall and build out a,ep080
933,tree ensuite we've done projects before,ep080
936,then dollar signs dollar signs dollar,ep080
939,signs,ep080
942,keeping Tom's wish list in mind Karen's,ep080
945,found a house closer to his ideal budget,ep080
948,with plenty of yard space let's go look,ep080
951,at this place I mean I'm really,ep080
954,concerned about that busy road that were,ep080
957,on,ep080
960,[Music],ep080
963,should we a little penny in the person,ep080
966,setting luck,ep080
969,"you already won a $600,000 budget you",ep080
972,want me to throw money away working with,ep080
975,"a maximum budget of $600,000 though Tom",ep080
978,would like to spend significantly less,ep080
981,this couple is looking for a house in,ep080
984,the suburbs of Atlanta so far they've,ep080
987,seen a two-story traditional in Mableton,ep080
990,that had Melissa's bright white kitchen,ep080
993,then they saw a cape cod in Sandy,ep080
996,Springs that had a great backyard for,ep080
999,their son Tommy,ep080
1002,but both houses were closer to Melissa's,ep080
1005,budget and neither one had the space for,ep080
1008,Toms horses so today their agent Karen,ep080
1011,will be showing them another house in,ep080
1014,Mapleton hoping it will have exactly,ep080
1017,what Tom's looking for so this house is,ep080
1020,amazing,ep080
1023,it sits on three acres of land with this,ep080
1026,beautiful lake in the front and there's,ep080
1029,plenty room for the horses what's the,ep080
1032,budget here so this home is three,ep080
1035,hundred eighty seven thousand nine,ep080
1038,hundred well let's go look at this place,ep080
1041,dang I mean I'm really concerned about,ep080
1044,that busy road that we're on and while,ep080
1047,the lake is beautiful that could be kind,ep080
1050,of dangerous for Tommy right but we're,ep080
1053,gonna have to put fencing up for the,ep080
1056,horses we can fence off the road we can,ep080
1059,fence off the lake you know we had this,ep080
1062,great porch here it's at that southern,ep080
1065,charm that we have you can sit out here,ep080
1068,enjoy the evening I think I think we,ep080
1071,should take a look all right all right,ep080
1074,oh wow this is gorgeous I love this yeah,ep080
1077,a lot of light coming through the window,ep080
1080,good I love the dark hardwood floors the,ep080
1083,nice farmhouse trim look at the details,ep080
1086,of this built-ins I like the arch I like,ep080
1089,the crown molding it's a really nice,ep080
1092,classic style there's some nice little,ep080
1095,southern charm here just off the living,ep080
1098,space they see a guest room with an,ep080
1101,ensuite before heading into the kitchen,ep080
1104,walk in the kitchens to your right,ep080
1107,that's got a great view to the dining,ep080
1110,room as well as take a look this is a,ep080
1113,good sized kitchen this this is not my,ep080
1116,bright white kitchen that I was looking,ep080
1119,for it,ep080
1122,the tile countertops again we can fix,ep080
1125,all this I'm open to some small,ep080
1128,renovations but we have a two-year-old,ep080
1131,now things are different,ep080
1134,I just want to be settled and enjoy our,ep080
1137,home so the dining room is very,ep080
1140,expensive and it has crown moldings,ep080
1143,throughout and the hardwood floors that,ep080
1146,you love I mean you can go out to the,ep080
1149,patio view have barbecues out there a,ep080
1152,nice flow into the back into the kitchen,ep080
1155,and everything I mean I could probably,ep080
1158,make this work now over here it does,ep080
1161,have a wet bar I mean it's not my bar,ep080
1164,that I really want but it's nice that,ep080
1167,it's office out the dining room or,ep080
1170,entertaining you've never been here and,ep080
1173,this is a bonus room this could be a,ep080
1176,good place for Tommy to play we could,ep080
1179,keep his toys in here we can get the,ep080
1182,clutter down the fact that it doesn't,ep080
1185,have a basement is a little concerning,ep080
1188,but the back room is separate so I think,ep080
1191,we can use that back area for Tommy's,ep080
1194,area down the hall they take a look at,ep080
1197,two more bedrooms with a Jack and Jill,ep080
1200,bathroom before heading to the master,ep080
1203,retreat this is the master suite,ep080
1206,and it is spectacular wow this this is,ep080
1209,like it's brand-new it's almost like,ep080
1212,this is not the same house exactly but,ep080
1215,if you can make the rest of the house,ep080
1218,look like this we might have a deal I,ep080
1221,think it sounds like you're compromising,ep080
1224,I'm considering right here's a little,ep080
1227,secret we've got an office right off of,ep080
1230,the master specific for Tom this is good,ep080
1233,because I can keep the bedroom doors,ep080
1236,closed oh my calls and Karen this is,ep080
1239,gorgeous no money has to be spent here,ep080
1242,it's already done that is true this,ep080
1245,feels like a spa I love that it loves it,ep080
1248,is that the shower bag this is,ep080
1251,floor-to-ceiling tile,ep080
1254,oh are you imagine look at that this is,ep080
1257,already done anything seriously that,ep080
1260,this this is perfection,ep080
1263,[Music],ep080
1266,I mean the property is great we can do a,ep080
1269,lot with what I want to do the price,ep080
1272,can't beat the price from for my likings,ep080
1275,the second half of the house definitely,ep080
1278,was better we're gonna have to put quite,ep080
1281,a bit into this I mean the entire,ep080
1284,kitchen needs to be redone,ep080
1287,and it doesn't matter how much money you,ep080
1290,put into it we're still on that really,ep080
1293,busy road since none of the homes meet,ep080
1296,their entire wish list they have to,ep080
1299,decide what's most important a white,ep080
1302,kitchen a space for the horses or a,ep080
1305,large master suite what are you thinking,ep080
1308,what do you think,ep080
1311,[Music],ep080
1314,recent Denver transplants Thom and,ep080
1317,"Melissa have a $600,000 budget to buy a",ep080
1320,home in the Atlanta Georgia area they've,ep080
1323,seen several options and now it's time,ep080
1326,to choose so what do you think about the,ep080
1329,two-story traditional for five hundred,ep080
1332,and eighty nine thousand you know I,ep080
1335,think it can work had tons of space,ep080
1338,completely finished basement and of,ep080
1341,course my gorgeous white kitchen the,ep080
1344,screen and porch no bugs but that,ep080
1347,backyard I was a little worried about,ep080
1350,some of the slope there and in that,ep080
1353,ravine for that price range I still,ep080
1356,don't get it any land for my horses what,ep080
1359,do you think about the Cape Cod yeah,ep080
1362,that one was six hundred and fourteen,ep080
1365,thousand the flat backyard was amazing,ep080
1368,yeah had a great backyard but a place,ep080
1371,didn't have a screened-in porch sitting,ep080
1374,room mm-hmm had the finishes we were,ep080
1377,looking for the crown molding chair rail,ep080
1380,I mean we're gonna have to do some work,ep080
1383,though on that kitchen so what about the,ep080
1386,ranch three seven nine it's exactly,ep080
1389,southern porch I gotta pee on CD but I,ep080
1392,wasn't really surprised me it is one,ep080
1395,story which we're not crazy about the,ep080
1398,kitchen needs to be completely gutted in,ep080
1401,my opinion for the second half of the,ep080
1404,house was completely done but that busy,ep080
1407,busy street I mean I'm very concerned,ep080
1410,about that,ep080
1413,and this house didn't have a basement,ep080
1416,what are you thinking what do you think,ep080
1419,I think the two-story makes the most,ep080
1422,sense for us I agree it has a space for,ep080
1425,us it has the entire finished basement,ep080
1428,that you're looking for has my,ep080
1431,incredible dream kitchen I mean I think,ep080
1434,if I'm not gonna be have the horses on,ep080
1437,the property I think it this is the best,ep080
1440,best place for family all right I'm,ep080
1443,excited throw it on the floor well now I,ep080
1446,move a pile from one place to the next,ep080
1449,one it's my system just go it means like,ep080
1452,you're just putting stuff on the floor,ep080
1455,so we closed about three three weeks ago,ep080
1458,you've been here a week everything's a,ep080
1461,disaster but it's good is it good,ep080
1464,there's like nothing put away I can't,ep080
1467,find anything that's insane I mean like,ep080
1470,how did this even get here well I mean,ep080
1473,it's your system so I'm sure there was a,ep080
1476,reason for it so the list price of this,ep080
1479,house is 589 thousand I think after some,ep080
1482,negotiation it was five hundred and,ep080
1485,seventy two thousand I just I just had,ep080
1488,this feeling like when we walked in this,ep080
1491,house felt really homey and cozy I think,ep080
1494,this this room is amazing being outside,ep080
1497,no from your mom,ep080
1500,Tom compromise the most in this house as,ep080
1503,he does with most things you know it,ep080
1506,doesn't have all the things that I,ep080
1509,wanted but it hits most Lamarck we have,ep080
1512,my office so we have the for more than,ep080
1515,four bedrooms we have a finished,ep080
1518,basement I don't have the horses in the,ep080
1521,backyard but we are only 15 minutes away,ep080
1524,from the Polo Club I love the,ep080
1527,screened-in porch but my favorite room,ep080
1530,has to be the kitchen that is absolutely,ep080
1533,what I view is the heart of the home,ep080
1536,okay guys ready to eat,ep080
1539,yeah I envisioned our life here a lot,ep080
1542,more relaxed friends around having,ep080
1545,family around you know that's what I,ep080
1548,grew up with that's why we moved and,ep080
1551,that's everything to us,ep080
1554,angry excellent,ep080
12,this is great,ep081
15,Kansas couple Jason and Donna are,ep081
18,leaving behind the suburbs for a house,ep081
21,in the country and for Jason the more,ep081
24,land the better this is sitting on 21,ep081
27,acres Wow yeah you love that this is,ep081
30,beautiful but there is a giant desk trap,ep081
33,right there,ep081
36,deathtrap where another issue she wants,ep081
39,move-in ready this is fancy great,ep081
42,updating he's itching to take on a,ep081
45,fixer-upper there's a lot of stuff going,ep081
48,on in here,ep081
51,paneling cracks water dimension of,ep081
54,ceiling project I love it who will win,ep081
57,we can spend more of our time doing fun,ep081
60,things instead of remodeling I can,ep081
63,always find something else to remodel,ep081
66,[Music],ep081
69,I stay outside I'm Jason and I am an,ep081
72,electrical designer I'm Donna and I work,ep081
75,as a painting instructor at an art,ep081
78,studio we're both pretty creative he,ep081
81,builds things and I pretty much design,ep081
84,it so I'll draw something out and say,ep081
87,this is what I want and help build it up,ep081
90,for me,ep081
93,courses all right wait we've been,ep081
96,married for almost 10 years now our,ep081
99,family consists of two boys Sam and Brad,ep081
102,they're eight and six,ep081
105,Jason's job has taken the family all,ep081
108,across the Midwest but for the past six,ep081
111,years,ep081
114,they've called Kansas home Kansas City,ep081
117,has a great metropolitan area there's a,ep081
120,lot of arts and things to do this is,ep081
123,great nice to spend time outdoors with,ep081
126,the family we live in the suburbs so we,ep081
129,have all the amenities that we would,ep081
132,like as a family they've got a lot of,ep081
135,kid-friendly activities yeah we can ride,ep081
138,dirt bikes our home it's very new I want,ep081
141,too we like having an HOA and the fact,ep081
144,that they keep everything nice but we,ep081
147,would like to have a little bit more,ep081
150,space because our boys are getting older,ep081
153,racy cars and and building blocks have,ep081
156,now turned into more of a dirt bike and,ep081
159,Recreation recreational area so Jason,ep081
162,and Donna want to buy a four-bed,ep081
165,three-bath house in the countryside,ep081
168,communities of eastern Kansas and have,ep081
171,"set their budget at $500,000",ep081
174,there's definitely not enough space,ep081
177,outside there's not enough land growing,ep081
180,up mainly in Texas,ep081
183,we typically were on more land I want,ep081
186,something with minimum 20 acres that's,ep081
189,kind of a lot I don't know what we're,ep081
192,going to do with all that how about this,ep081
195,house lots of Windows,ep081
198,yeah we need a little bit more room,ep081
201,though not that much the biggest,ep081
204,challenge of our house hunt is her I,ep081
207,wouldn't say that I would say it could,ep081
210,be you looks like it's pretty updated we,ep081
213,could just move in not a lot of room for,ep081
216,any improvements that's great I'm,ep081
219,looking for a fixer-upper I want to be,ep081
222,able to teach the boys things that my,ep081
225,dad taught me growing up I'm looking for,ep081
228,something that,ep081
231,move-in ready I know you like a lot of,ep081
234,projects but I would like something that,ep081
237,we can just move into and enjoy each,ep081
240,other I really don't want a basement the,ep081
243,extra space would be good another issue,ep081
246,Jason likes the look of a farmhouse or a,ep081
249,ranch ranch started kind of boring it's,ep081
252,just a rectangle usually kind of plain,ep081
255,nice and simple as a craftsman type,ep081
258,column I think it's really pretty with,ep081
261,the different roof lines I would really,ep081
264,like an ornate craftsman with details I,ep081
267,went to design school for interior,ep081
270,design so I have some appreciation for,ep081
273,moldings that have some character and,ep081
276,maybe has some upgrades in the kitchen,ep081
279,and space for an island I like the,ep081
282,things to be light and clean not dark,ep081
285,and really looking I do not want high,ep081
288,ceilings they cost a lot to heat and,ep081
291,cool energy efficiency would you like,ep081
294,some big trees to climb that would make,ep081
297,trees I would love to find a treasure on,ep081
300,some property some outbuildings I do a,ep081
303,lot of woodworking we need space to do,ep081
306,all that fun stuff a pond to just be,ep081
309,able to irrigate crops or possibly a,ep081
312,garden and I think he's crazy it's,ep081
315,unsafe it's dirty and I'm not having it,ep081
318,see guys this is why I need my own girl,ep081
321,space I would really love something,ep081
324,unique like a separate art studio and,ep081
327,just get away from all the boy things,ep081
330,and do my hobby it's like painting so,ep081
333,the challenge is finding I guess all,ep081
336,that compromise in the area that we're,ep081
339,looking for first up a house for Jason,ep081
342,this is a 1940's farmhouse I really like,ep081
345,that it's a farm helps it's not the,ep081
348,craftsman that I wanted but it does have,ep081
351,some different roof lines and some,ep081
354,details so it's not boring I can deal,ep081
357,with that how many acres 20 acres for 30,ep081
360,acres that's great is that pond on the,ep081
363,property that pond is not on this,ep081
366,property,ep081
369,you're awesome that's fantastic I love,ep081
372,that I think this is a beautiful,ep081
375,property and the beauty of it all is,ep081
378,that it's listed at 475 that's great,ep081
381,what do you think Wow nice hardwood,ep081
384,floors everywhere nice living room space,ep081
387,I like the group,ep081
390,windows over here at listen a lot of,ep081
393,light there is a little bit of a vaulted,ep081
396,ceiling in this part of the house mix it,ep081
399,light and bright and spacious,ep081
402,not really let's go take a look at the,ep081
405,kitchen okay I think it's a fantastic,ep081
408,size I don't like the wood tone though,ep081
411,the color of the cabinets the appliances,ep081
414,definitely have to go these are old,ep081
417,there's no island I can definitely see,ep081
420,myself living here we could actually fix,ep081
423,it up and make it something that she,ep081
426,could really enjoy Wow this is also,ep081
429,something I didn't expect the built in,ep081
432,so has kind of a Crossman feel to it,ep081
435,really pretty built-in bench would you,ep081
438,keep this carpet here I know now,ep081
441,completely remove the carpet there are,ep081
444,some things going on here there's cracks,ep081
447,and the ceilings and the walls there's,ep081
450,water stains possibly roof leaks or,ep081
453,something it doesn't look like a few,ep081
456,things that are gonna need to be,ep081
459,addressed more projects so over here is,ep081
462,the sunroom my goodness there's so much,ep081
465,light with all the windows I could see,ep081
468,myself painting out here having my own,ep081
471,art space bedroom number one,ep081
474,not too bad for I guess a voice for kids,ep081
477,room kind of popcorn ceiling might need,ep081
480,to remove that it's not too bad I grew,ep081
483,up with that I see cracks on the wall,ep081
486,though it's wide here that we're correct,ep081
489,next bedroom there's a lot of stuff,ep081
492,going on in here,ep081
495,paneling cracks holes holes water damage,ep081
498,in the ceiling this is a bit much for me,ep081
501,Donna sees this is a lifelong renovation,ep081
504,but I see it as a lifelong family,ep081
507,commitment they pass a bathroom project,ep081
510,I love it as they head upstairs here to,ep081
513,the right is your bedroom with the full,ep081
516,bathroom and this is your master,ep081
519,attached then you have to come through,ep081
522,the master bedroom to get to the bedroom,ep081
525,it's kind of inconvenient maybe make a,ep081
528,door here to separate you we would have,ep081
531,to that's really weird and awkward more,ep081
534,building I can take the upstairs floor,ep081
537,plan and make it into something great,ep081
540,I'm really worried that all these,ep081
543,projects are gonna turn into a,ep081
546,never-ending,ep081
549,once you open a wall you never know what,ep081
552,you're gonna find your master bath huh,ep081
555,okay,ep081
558,if you were to move anything the raised,ep081
561,floor drainage and piping and everything,ep081
564,would have to be redone it would,ep081
567,probably be a lot of work there's a lot,ep081
570,of work it's the key word here they head,ep081
573,outside to look at the workshop wow this,ep081
576,is huge,ep081
579,can you see yourself doing a lot of,ep081
582,projects in here more than one for sure,ep081
585,boys I'm liking it a lot,ep081
588,[Music],ep081
591,I like the outside of it it has a little,ep081
594,bit of appeal and design doesn't have a,ep081
597,pond or a water source but I like,ep081
600,doesn't have a pond I mean you've got,ep081
603,your 20 acres you've got the outbuilding,ep081
606,I'm really concerned about all the,ep081
609,things that need to be done this is,ep081
612,basically the definition of not moving,ep081
615,ready I really like that there's more,ep081
618,than 10 projects yeah more than 10,ep081
621,whirring every room that you walk into,ep081
624,there's something that needs to be done,ep081
627,to please Donna they're going to see a,ep081
630,house that's been completely updated but,ep081
633,it comes at a price,ep081
636,"ouch that's about 10,000 our highest",ep081
639,that we want it to be,ep081
642,[Music],ep081
645,I love being able to be so close to a,ep081
648,place like this and free my boys to go,ep081
651,bike riding on the trails wanting out of,ep081
654,the burbs Jason and Donna are hunting,ep081
657,for a house with lots of land in the,ep081
660,eastern Kansas countryside,ep081
663,problem is while she wants an upgrade at,ep081
666,home he would love to get his hands,ep081
669,dirty I would really like a fixer-upper,ep081
672,so that I have a non-stop to-do list,ep081
675,"working with a budget of $500,000",ep081
678,they've seen a farmhouse on 20 acres of,ep081
681,land with plenty of projects to please,ep081
684,Jason's inner handyman but Donna wanted,ep081
687,it to be more move-in-ready so now their,ep081
690,agent has lined up a much more updated,ep081
693,house that she hopes they'll both like,ep081
696,it's been totally remodeled on the main,ep081
699,floor I think you'll really like this,ep081
702,yes it's five bedrooms three and a half,ep081
705,bathrooms we're sitting on 10 acres,ep081
708,definitely not the craftsman that I was,ep081
711,hoping but it is a ranch Jason right I,ep081
714,know Donna once a Craftsman style home,ep081
717,but with the amount of acreage that,ep081
720,they're looking for in this seller's,ep081
723,market that's gonna be really hard to,ep081
726,come by price is listed at 5:10 we want,ep081
729,it to be a little bit more than the,ep081
732,budget but I don't think you'll have to,ep081
735,do anything except move in this house is,ep081
738,over budget and 10 acres I was really,ep081
741,wanting 20 this house it better be,ep081
744,immaculate so this is great this is,ep081
747,amazing right there's a lot of space,ep081
750,here a lot of updates nice dining space,ep081
753,this is a big bright space house also,ep081
756,has lots of windows that's great,ep081
759,I love those fixtures that they've used,ep081
762,and the colors that they've done it,ep081
765,looks very nice and this is the kitchen,ep081
768,nice and open it doesn't have the island,ep081
771,that I want though you've got the space,ep081
774,here for the island the appliances are,ep081
777,nice and everything is new and updated I,ep081
780,really do like it we can spend more of,ep081
783,our time doing fun things instead of,ep081
786,remodeling nope right,ep081
789,MAGIX I'm not really loving the wood,ep081
792,tone cabinets that is something I would,ep081
795,want to change I'm actually liking it,ep081
798,looks really nice I really agree with,ep081
801,Jason on this one I like they check out,ep081
804,the backyard this is beautiful very very,ep081
807,pretty but there is a giant death trap,ep081
810,right there,ep081
813,death trap where the pond is are,ep081
816,literally right out your back door our,ep081
819,kids could just walk outside and fall in,ep081
822,no they wouldn't they would have to,ep081
825,cross the entire backyards of fallen she,ep081
828,could always put up a temporary fence,ep081
831,something that would keep the boys in,ep081
834,closer to the house and still allow,ep081
837,Jason the opportunity to have water on,ep081
840,the property I've got a great,ep081
843,outbuilding to show you I can see you,ep081
846,doing like your woodworking some auto,ep081
849,mechanics unlimited we can do pretty,ep081
852,much anything that we wanted project,ep081
855,wise in here they go back inside the,ep081
858,house to look at the master suite pretty,ep081
861,good space I like the big windows in,ep081
864,here I'm not so sure about this big,ep081
867,bench on the wall though Jason is that,ep081
870,something you think could be moved or it,ep081
873,could be relocated something for you to,ep081
876,do there's one project Jason just one,ep081
879,everything looks really awesome but I,ep081
882,can always find something else to,ep081
885,remodel my beauty products in here and,ep081
888,they go across the hall to look at one,ep081
891,of the kids bedrooms very nice size for,ep081
894,a secondary bedroom the closets with the,ep081
897,louver doors are a nice detail I really,ep081
900,like that and the light fixture again is,ep081
903,really nice looking and off this bedroom,ep081
906,you have a nice Jack and Jill bathroom,ep081
909,or maybe you'll call it a Brad and Sam,ep081
912,this is fancy great updating nice big,ep081
915,open space too in the bathroom I don't,ep081
918,think this is normal they passed through,ep081
921,the adjoining bedroom before heading,ep081
924,down to the basement,ep081
927,Wow it's pretty big we've got a little,ep081
930,light coming in from a window while,ep081
933,they're secluded down here I love the,ep081
936,idea of having a separate art space all,ep081
939,to myself is really exciting what do you,ep081
942,guys think about the house I really love,ep081
945,the big workshop that they have here I,ep081
948,really did want move-in-ready and this,ep081
951,is it there's hardly anything to do here,ep081
954,I really like that there is a water,ep081
957,source if the lake is stocked with fish,ep081
960,we could actually teach the boys how to,ep081
963,fish here on the property we could teach,ep081
966,them how to fish elsewhere I'm,ep081
969,definitely disappointed that there is,ep081
972,only 10 acres so now they're going to,ep081
975,see a house with twice as much land for,ep081
978,Jason this is a ranch-style house I,ep081
981,really like this,ep081
984,[Music],ep081
987,what do you like to do outside back,ep081
990,flipping off trees Jason and Donna want,ep081
993,to raise their sons out in the country,ep081
996,and are searching eastern Kansas for a,ep081
999,house with acreage they have a budget of,ep081
1002,"$500,000 but can't agree on what they",ep081
1005,want so far they've seen a dated,ep081
1008,farmhouse on 20 acres of land with,ep081
1011,enough projects to keep Jason busy for,ep081
1014,years,ep081
1017,then they saw an updated ranch exactly,ep081
1020,what Donna wants but it was on ten acres,ep081
1023,smaller than what Jason likes so now,ep081
1026,they're going to see a house on a much,ep081
1029,bigger lot this is a ranch-style house I,ep081
1032,really like this it's three bedrooms two,ep081
1035,bathrooms 104 well let's take a look,ep081
1038,because there's been some renovations,ep081
1041,and some addition so we're really,ep081
1044,"looking at more like 4,000 square feet",ep081
1047,so you might be able to find someplace,ep081
1050,to expand listed at 405 all right price,ep081
1053,is right in there yes I think you'll,ep081
1056,like the fact that this is sitting on 21,ep081
1059,acres Wow yeah you love that yes so,ep081
1062,there might be some opportunity for you,ep081
1065,to do some expansion in the home and I,ep081
1068,know how you guys like projects all,ep081
1071,right structuring built on I know Donna,ep081
1074,thinks that 20 acres plus is too much,ep081
1077,land for her but I think that we could,ep081
1080,use it for a lot of different activities,ep081
1083,that the family could enjoy in in the,ep081
1086,future what do you think about these,ep081
1089,hardwood floors,ep081
1092,nothing is nice it's light and bright I,ep081
1095,think it can be a little bit darker,ep081
1098,that'd be something you could do Jason,ep081
1101,no project number one got a beautiful,ep081
1104,fireplace,ep081
1107,place it has some detail which I like so,ep081
1110,that's nice let's go take a look at the,ep081
1113,rest of house Wow here's your kitchen,ep081
1116,and your eatin dining area kind of small,ep081
1119,dining room I really wanted a large,ep081
1122,kitchen with an island you can't fit one,ep081
1125,but it's a little tight in the middle I,ep081
1128,would love if the cabinets were white,ep081
1131,and it would be light and bright maybe,ep081
1134,we could actually just stain them or it,ep081
1137,could be moving ready they move on to an,ep081
1140,addition that's off the kitchen I would,ep081
1143,kind of call this maybe like the family,ep081
1146,room okay great what do you think about,ep081
1149,this higher ceiling in this room don't,ep081
1152,really like it they're not really,ep081
1155,energy-efficient and I think it's really,ep081
1158,wasted space only my husband would not,ep081
1161,like vaulted ceilings he's crazy it's,ep081
1164,only a few dollars extra per month and,ep081
1167,it's so much lighter and brighter maybe,ep081
1170,do something with the wall you want to,ep081
1173,open it up a little bit up a little,ep081
1176,right that's nice and pretty good shape,ep081
1179,is this the main bathroom this is your a,ep081
1182,full bath on this end of the hall okay I,ep081
1185,hate that there is no dedicated master,ep081
1188,bathroom we would be sharing with the,ep081
1191,guests and the kids then that would be,ep081
1194,correct,ep081
1197,yeah this would definitely need to be,ep081
1200,renovated so this is the master bedroom,ep081
1203,of the home mm-hmm I don't know if this,ep081
1206,is a good size I don't think all of our,ep081
1209,furniture would even fit in here I mean,ep081
1212,we have our 21 acres here right maybe if,ep081
1215,you could see yourself you know bumping,ep081
1218,the walls out to add on you know a,ep081
1221,master bathroom the costs are starting,ep081
1224,to add up though we'd have to see what,ep081
1227,we can do they go down the hall to look,ep081
1230,at two more bedrooms it has the carpet,ep081
1233,in here yeah we would have to pull that,ep081
1236,out add that to the list of projects,ep081
1239,Rhonda must have been thinking about me,ep081
1242,when she found this house I could see a,ep081
1245,lot of renovations turn into a lot of,ep081
1248,family time so this is the basement I,ep081
1251,really don't know what we would do down,ep081
1254,here I would rather be outside do you,ep081
1257,think you maybe you would use this as,ep081
1260,your art studio there's not a lot of,ep081
1263,natural light though which I really,ep081
1266,would like next they head outside wow I,ep081
1269,love the deck I see that there was,ep081
1272,Meadows yeah I was about to say that I,ep081
1275,not a big fan of all the hills that's,ep081
1278,not really even I kind of like it I'm,ep081
1281,not a big fan of the pond the boys and,ep081
1284,the dog would possibly be in there,ep081
1287,I disagree so there are some,ep081
1290,outbuildings on the property,ep081
1293,what would you guys use these buildings,ep081
1296,for workshop we could probably convert,ep081
1299,this over into it looks like it has,ep081
1302,power that's great,ep081
1305,maybe storage really house for the boys,ep081
1308,[Applause],ep081
1311,[Music],ep081
1314,I like the land a lot we're gonna be,ep081
1317,able to do a lot with it the size of the,ep081
1320,house is pretty good I don't like that,ep081
1323,the kitchen is really small and it,ep081
1326,doesn't have a very good workable island,ep081
1329,the outbuildings the the barn we could,ep081
1332,possibly do a workshop it doesn't have,ep081
1335,an art space though for a dedicated,ep081
1338,painting area for me only the basement,ep081
1341,and there's not a lot of natural light,ep081
1344,down there,ep081
1347,I mean with 21 acres you could probably,ep081
1350,build something very easily half there,ep081
1353,and like on the projects Mariano,ep081
1356,now it's time to decide what's more,ep081
1359,important choosing a house that's,ep081
1362,move-in ready has space for an art,ep081
1365,studio or has a lot of land have you,ep081
1368,thought any more about which house,ep081
1371,you're considering,ep081
1374,[Music],ep081
1377,"working with a budget of $500,000 Jason",ep081
1380,and Donna have been searching the,ep081
1383,country areas of eastern Kansas for a,ep081
1386,house with a lot of land having seen,ep081
1389,several homes they're meeting up with,ep081
1392,their agent Rhonda to decide which one,ep081
1395,is right for their family tell me about,ep081
1398,the 1940s farmhouse priced at 475 the,ep081
1401,1940s farmhouse was more towards the,ep081
1404,Craftsman style that I was looking for,ep081
1407,and I'm so happy that that one does not,ep081
1410,have a pond on it but the water source,ep081
1413,is something that I really want the,ep081
1416,workshop was very big I had a nice,ep081
1419,sunroom that I could use for an art,ep081
1422,studio in the future you know there'll,ep081
1425,be lots of projects at that house it's,ep081
1428,not moving ready you would have your,ep081
1431,work cut out for you I'm not sure if I,ep081
1434,want to deal with all that it would take,ep081
1437,a lot of time what about the ranch that,ep081
1440,was on ten acres priced at five ten but,ep081
1443,move-in ready for you Donna with move-in,ep081
1446,ready comes over budget it did have a,ep081
1449,really nice workshop for projects that,ep081
1452,don't really exist the main areas of the,ep081
1455,house had a lot of natural light with,ep081
1458,all of the windows a basement it was a,ep081
1461,good amount of space for me to do art,ep081
1464,down there the ten acres we could use a,ep081
1467,little bit more had a giant pond right,ep081
1470,out the back door,ep081
1473,it did and that's just not safe for the,ep081
1476,kids at all they do know how to swim,ep081
1479,still what would you think of the ranch,ep081
1482,with over 20 acres and it was priced,ep081
1485,right at 405 it had an awesome workshop,ep081
1488,the kitchen was a little small and it,ep081
1491,was very dated the land though was,ep081
1494,really nice the water source with the,ep081
1497,pond my art studio was missing except,ep081
1500,for the basement there was no light down,ep081
1503,there that house had a great family room,ep081
1506,that was a nice room and had a lot of,ep081
1509,windows and a lot of light we've,ep081
1512,probably had to add an addition for the,ep081
1515,master bedroom it had a really small,ep081
1518,master we'd be able to tackle it and,ep081
1521,keep it within budget I mean lots of,ep081
1524,projects also,ep081
1527,[Music],ep081
1530,the farmhouse yes it needed a lot of,ep081
1533,work but the farmhouse had nice interest,ep081
1536,in details that I really liked it has a,ep081
1539,space for my art studio away from the,ep081
1542,boys and everyone I think that would be,ep081
1545,fantastic and there's no pond we bought,ep081
1548,the house three weeks ago and a week ago,ep081
1551,we started moving our things in and we,ep081
1554,started remodeling the house was listed,ep081
1557,at four hundred and seventy five,ep081
1560,thousand and with Rhonda's help we,ep081
1563,actually got the house at four hundred,ep081
1566,and thirty five thousand I'm so glad,ep081
1569,Donna was on board with taking on,ep081
1572,renovations and projects and we are,ep081
1575,looking like we want no mold since we're,ep081
1578,doing renovations I put the kitchen on,ep081
1581,the list and decided to do it first,ep081
1584,we've painted the cabinets white since I,ep081
1587,didn't like the golden oak that it was,ep081
1590,before we're also getting a new gas,ep081
1593,range of built-in wall convection oven,ep081
1596,with any surprises that have come up,ep081
1599,we've been able to handle it ourselves,ep081
1602,I'm really lucky to have the sunroom to,ep081
1605,paint in it has a lot of windows and,ep081
1608,natural light getting it ready for paint,ep081
1611,looking awesome my favorite space would,ep081
1614,have to be the workshop we're gonna be,ep081
1617,able to spend a lot of quality time and,ep081
1620,be able to teach our kids this house far,ep081
1623,exceeds my expectations the workshop art,ep081
1626,space and plenty of space for the future,ep081
1629,and activities cool,ep081

126,why she's a great physician Ruben has,ep082
129,the most electric personality not only,ep082
132,is he fun-loving but he has like the,ep082
135,Ricky Martin look I think that's why I'm,ep082
138,so in love with him anything we do we do,ep082
141,with our daughter family time is a very,ep082
144,important especially with Saira and just,ep082
147,enjoy some good quality time and just,ep082
150,take Sara wherever we can,ep082
153,did you like the tomatoes are they sweet,ep082
156,we're currently renting in Corona,ep082
159,California and now with Molly done with,ep082
162,residency it's time for us to settle,ep082
165,down,ep082
168,we'd like to purchase a home in Anaheim,ep082
171,Hills California it's central to where I,ep082
174,work and Molony works it's 30 minutes,ep082
177,from the beach about an hour from the,ep082
180,mountains and also it's close to family,ep082
183,we've been searching for a home for,ep082
186,three years and it has been a long,ep082
189,drawn-out exhausting process that's,ep082
192,because the couple is far apart on their,ep082
195,wish list starting with the budget my,ep082
198,budget would be preferably near 1,ep082
201,million dollars my budget is 1.5 I grew,ep082
204,up in Orange County there is no way that,ep082
207,in a million dollars we're gonna find,ep082
210,the space that we want we'd prefer at,ep082
213,least four bedrooms and three baths what,ep082
216,do you feel this house I know something,ep082
219,about the layout yeah,ep082
222,the style of home that I want is a,ep082
225,ranch-style preferably single-story yet,ep082
228,I want it to have a little bit of a,ep082
231,Spanish / Mediterranean Flair Ruben is,ep082
234,looking for a contemporary style home,ep082
237,and isn't a fan of single stories I do,ep082
240,prefer two-story home because it's nice,ep082
243,to get away back in our bedroom on,ep082
246,second floor it's a two-story two story,ep082
249,which I like is that two straight it,ep082
252,just looks like windows let's see what's,ep082
255,inside check out yeah call it porky,ep082
258,neurotic one thing that's really,ep082
261,important to me is I want our doorway or,ep082
264,entryway facing east my grandmother,ep082
267,always had said that it's very good luck,ep082
270,if your door opens to the east I do,ep082
273,carry a compass with me sometimes the,ep082
276,agents will tell you oh the door faces,ep082
279,east and I have corrected them like no,ep082
282,it does not,ep082
285,oh I like that - laughs,ep082
288,for actually so much,ep082
291,wish list is to at least have an open,ep082
294,floor plan since we enjoy spending time,ep082
297,at home and cooking and entertaining,ep082
300,I want a dramatic entryway I want to,ep082
303,walk in and I want to have like high,ep082
306,ceilings another thing that's very,ep082
309,important is we're looking for a view,ep082
312,because I want to open up my bedroom,ep082
315,windows and see like of the entire,ep082
318,skyline,ep082
321,and I have to have a Sex in the City,ep082
324,style closet it doesn't have to look,ep082
327,like that when I find it but it will,ep082
330,become like that they prefer a,ep082
333,move-in-ready home with a big white,ep082
336,kitchen the kitchen looks nice not,ep082
339,actually that big ya head of the island,ep082
342,though would you that's what you wanted,ep082
345,isn't it I need a huge kitchen because I,ep082
348,want a huge center island and I want a,ep082
351,lot of space to move this is a nice pool,ep082
354,I like it I don't want a pool I would,ep082
357,love to have a pool because Cyril loves,ep082
360,to swim oh I do not want to pull just,ep082
363,the sheer like danger aspect of it that,ep082
366,makes me a little nervous and upkeep,ep082
369,there's no way I'm cleaning a pool sorry,ep082
372,very fun yeah yeah we can all wait to,ep082
375,purchase our first home it's been a long,ep082
378,time waiting we work we work very hard,ep082
381,to get where we are at and now we've,ep082
384,saved up enough money to purchase a,ep082
387,beautiful home first up their agent and,ep082
390,family friend AJ is showing them a place,ep082
393,that's more Molony style so guys this is,ep082
396,a ranch-style home 5 bedroom 4 bathroom,ep082
399,"little over 4,000 square feet",ep082
402,oh wow and listed at 1.3 million I've,ep082
405,been showing them homes for years it's a,ep082
408,very difficult scenario they both love,ep082
411,totally different things you know look,ep082
414,at this archway that's completely like a,ep082
417,Spanish yeah the tile roof I always,ep082
420,wanted a ranch-style home because I like,ep082
423,the fact that all the square footage is,ep082
426,on one floor a 2-story home is important,ep082
429,to me because I do like having the,ep082
432,ability to separate the day-to-day,ep082
435,living area versus where we sleep,ep082
438,compass yes I have to make sure the door,ep082
441,faces east all right if face is directly,ep082
444,east this is good already okay let me,ep082
447,get the door for you,ep082
450,Wow this is a dramatic entryway Wow foot,ep082
453,ceilings yes gorgeous this used to make,ep082
456,a little bit more moderate home that's,ep082
459,why the ceilings are this high they've,ep082
462,built the master bedroom upstairs so you,ep082
465,like a second-story and we get the,ep082
468,ranch-style and that's a great,ep082
471,compromise perfect what's up with the,ep082
474,mirrors I like them yeah no I'm vain but,ep082
477,not that vain this is a formal dining,ep082
480,room,ep082
483,yes skylight yeah that's right I love,ep082
486,the natural light coming down I really,ep082
489,like that I like that because we could,ep082
492,look at ourselves these aren't as bad,ep082
495,because they aren't tinted well look at,ep082
498,the island that is a wonderful Island,ep082
501,the Alliance's are great okay but the,ep082
504,color we got to change all this,ep082
507,you're gonna refinish the cabinet dated,ep082
510,Oh what about the countertops I I think,ep082
513,I like it it's great we're gonna talk to,ep082
516,Jenni the color the space is wonderful,ep082
519,well the kitchen was beautiful it's got,ep082
522,a good foundation however the color that,ep082
525,is not what I would put in my home oh,ep082
528,wow,ep082
531,high ceilings look at that the thing,ep082
534,that you always wanted I owe the pool I,ep082
537,don't know about the pool my daughter's,ep082
540,4 and although she's able to swim I'm,ep082
543,just afraid cuz you just never know,ep082
546,that's like I deal breaker you know this,ep082
549,put a fence around the pool for kids if,ep082
552,that's your major concern and we'll put,ep082
555,a sensor on the door we've been at a,ep082
558,little difference of opinion I should,ep082
561,say I like pool my wife does not like a,ep082
564,pool but I think you'd be a great way to,ep082
567,bring the family together they walk,ep082
570,through a den with a wet bar Oh what's,ep082
573,this this used to be a master bedroom,ep082
576,don't turn this into a game room there's,ep082
579,a pool table come with us this used to,ep082
582,be a master bathroom okay what we got to,ep082
585,keep this no,ep082
588,down the hall they see three bedrooms,ep082
591,before heading upstairs to the master,ep082
594,suite Wow look how spacious this of it,ep082
597,is huge it's not the patio outside yeah,ep082
600,that's a death oh wow that is,ep082
603,breathtaking,ep082
606,this is beautiful alright let's look at,ep082
609,the closet yeah yeah there's another,ep082
612,closet this is bigger but it's right by,ep082
615,the bathroom but you can have this one,ep082
618,I'd rather have that one you can put,ep082
621,your shoes up there I do have plenty of,ep082
624,shoes he does have funny rows Oh what do,ep082
627,you think about me,ep082
630,bathrooms big what is up with the carpet,ep082
633,very icky it's got the space and the,ep082
636,light but we have to get it it's on the,ep082
639,higher end of our budget the house price,ep082
642,so we do how to keep that in mind the,ep082
645,renovation costs are gonna be pretty,ep082
648,high I would say you know I'm a bit,ep082
651,concerned because that's much higher,ep082
654,than I was hoping to pay so what do you,ep082
657,guys think of those it's a beautiful,ep082
660,house high ceilings the natural light,ep082
663,the view is breathtaking,ep082
666,Aleya it seems like a great compromise,ep082
669,and it does face east so yeah it is it's,ep082
672,directly the house is also at the upper,ep082
675,end of our budget there is a lot of work,ep082
678,so we're gonna have to put money in and,ep082
681,then the pool I'm just afraid because,ep082
684,saira so now their agents lined up a,ep082
687,place without a pool for Molony but it,ep082
690,comes with a compromise ah the door face,ep082
693,west,ep082
696,[Music],ep082
699,do you want to pool for our new house,ep082
702,yeah oh don't you think it'd be great to,ep082
705,have a pool with a budget between one,ep082
708,and 1.5 million power couple Molony and,ep082
711,Ruben want to lay down roots in Anaheim,ep082
714,Hills California so far they've seen a,ep082
717,one and a half story ranch-style place,ep082
720,Melanie's preference it had the pool he,ep082
723,wants but that's a deal-breaker for her,ep082
726,today they're seeing another ranch-style,ep082
729,house this is nice it looks like it's,ep082
732,one story hi Jay today I'm going to show,ep082
735,you a four bedroom two and a half,ep082
738,bathroom home which is a single-story,ep082
741,ranch-style home this house is a ranch,ep082
744,in style I would like a two-story home,ep082
747,because I like the separation between,ep082
750,day-to-day living space as well as where,ep082
753,we go to bed that's a key component for,ep082
756,"me 2,500 square feet listed only at 995",ep082
759,thousand dollars I do like that let's go,ep082
762,take a look at the house right oh we,ep082
765,have to check if the door is facing east,ep082
768,ah the door faced West yeah but let's,ep082
771,check it out inside and go from there,ep082
774,[Music],ep082
777,that dramatic entryway the ceilings are,ep082
780,a little bit low yeah it's all in here,ep082
783,but Oh see look when you walk into this,ep082
786,part of the room I like this the ceiling,ep082
789,is great,ep082
792,I like the beam it gives a lot of light,ep082
795,the windows are great the living room is,ep082
798,quite large and open I like the layout,ep082
801,yeah this has a lot of character and it,ep082
804,actually has a ranch-style feel I do,ep082
807,wish we had the separation though let's,ep082
810,take a peek at the yard oh it spans the,ep082
813,entire length of the property the,ep082
816,backyard had no view and that was a bit,ep082
819,of a turn-off oh there's no pool,ep082
822,no pool remember we can always get a,ep082
825,kiddy pool well for me or for Saira for,ep082
828,both of you,ep082
831,Wow look at the kitchen I like the,ep082
834,cabinets but there's no center island,ep082
837,and I don't like the cabinetry here,ep082
840,because it breaks up the family room in,ep082
843,the kitchen the kitchen was very small,ep082
846,it did not have any room for an island I,ep082
849,would have to do a lot of renovating to,ep082
852,add an island oh but I like this I like,ep082
855,the doors as a good indoor/outdoor feel,ep082
858,okay I like this room it's perfect if,ep082
861,I'm cooking in the kitchen she could be,ep082
864,playing here I do like this the molding,ep082
867,it's got good detail you know so let's,ep082
870,go look at the master bedroom now oh wow,ep082
873,look this room I like this it's a it's a,ep082
876,little small,ep082
879,the master is small but I think the,ep082
882,French doors make it appear like there's,ep082
885,a good indoor/outdoor see yeah look at,ep082
888,the bathroom the closets are a little,ep082
891,bit small,ep082
894,there's no walk-in closet AJ no what's,ep082
897,up with the shower no we're gonna have,ep082
900,to renovate this we would have to step,ep082
903,to this the master bath it had a step,ep082
906,into the bathtub which was very odd they,ep082
909,see another bathroom and the last three,ep082
912,bedrooms,ep082
915,oh this is nice I like this feeling feel,ep082
918,like this perfect for Saira yeah,ep082
921,[Music],ep082
924,so what do you think of the house guys I,ep082
927,think overall it's a really nice house,ep082
930,the price point it's great it's,ep082
933,single-story doesn't have a pool yeah,ep082
936,that's not yeah on the positive and what,ep082
939,I'm looking for the ceilings are good,ep082
942,the entryway is workable the issue is,ep082
945,the door doesn't face the eastern,ep082
948,entrance there weren't very specific,ep082
951,things they want to view and is facing,ep082
954,home at the same time with no pool so,ep082
957,it's kinda difficult for me to find a,ep082
960,place that they're like and since the,ep082
963,home also wasn't the two-story Rubin,ep082
966,wants their agents now trying one to his,ep082
969,taste and it might even be workable for,ep082
972,Molony its southeast,ep082
975,it has eased in it,ep082
978,[Music],ep082
981,[Music],ep082
984,Reuben and Melanie are looking for a,ep082
987,large family home in Anaheim Hills,ep082
990,California with a budget range of 1,ep082
993,million for Reuben and up to 1.5 million,ep082
996,for Molony they've seen a one and a half,ep082
999,story ranch that had a separate master,ep082
1002,for him and face East for her but it had,ep082
1005,a pool which is a deal-breaker for,ep082
1008,Molony next they saw another ranch that,ep082
1011,didn't have a pool but Reuben wasn't a,ep082
1014,fan of the one-story layout so today,ep082
1017,they're seeing a two-story for Reuben,ep082
1020,it's 5 bedroom 4 bathroom home and it is,ep082
1023,"little over 3,800 square feet they've",ep082
1026,reduced it to 1 million three hundred,ep082
1029,"and $15,000",ep082
1032,I like that that's a good price oh no,ep082
1035,it's on the higher end of our budget it,ep082
1038,is a very contemporary home I wanted two,ep082
1041,stories so I do like the fact that this,ep082
1044,home does offer let's go take a look,ep082
1047,inside let me check the direction,ep082
1050,because it has to be facing east okay oh,ep082
1053,it's south east,ep082
1056,it has a used in it it doesn't face,ep082
1059,directly east but I'm trying to have an,ep082
1062,open mind,ep082
1065,especially for my husband come on in,ep082
1068,guys look at those okay it's a little,ep082
1071,ditzy we I do like that I do like this,ep082
1074,like entryway is this the main family,ep082
1077,room yeah I I do like this size of it I,ep082
1080,don't like these stairs that's a safety,ep082
1083,hazard especially for Saira out on her a,ep082
1086,trip and get hurt let's look at the,ep082
1089,kitchen,ep082
1092,oh I like the center island and it's,ep082
1095,very open,ep082
1098,yeah it's a it's a good size lots of,ep082
1101,storage place look at the cabin perfect,ep082
1104,but we would need to update refinish,ep082
1107,them though,ep082
1110,oh wow look at this view,ep082
1113,but the backyard very tiny oh it's,ep082
1116,cramped and there's no swimming pool,ep082
1119,okay so this again the stairs with,ep082
1122,thyroid,ep082
1125,I don't think Saira house you're gonna,ep082
1128,play right a bike back here you have to,ep082
1131,remodel the backyard because it has to,ep082
1134,be kid-friendly for Saira that's all,ep082
1137,gonna cost money so Reuben is really,ep082
1140,conservative when it comes to the budget,ep082
1143,I'm not conservative I'm just being,ep082
1146,responsible I'm also seeing a lot of,ep082
1149,dollar signs that we're gonna have to,ep082
1152,spend to renovate the house to our,ep082
1155,liking and on top of that the home is,ep082
1158,already on the higher end of our budget,ep082
1161,they head upstairs to the master bedroom,ep082
1164,oh wow the master oh this is a nice,ep082
1167,bathroom I like the door thing Wow very,ep082
1170,nice Stein very big and it spots out -,ep082
1173,oh it's perfect in the shower it's great,ep082
1176,I like it,ep082
1179,oh but I love the actual where the,ep082
1182,bedroom is this is great look at that,ep082
1185,view and look at the light in here this,ep082
1188,is nothing waking up and drinking coffee,ep082
1191,every morning this is perfect we have,ep082
1194,the crown molding ceilings could be,ep082
1197,higher though yeah a little low that,ep082
1200,fireplace that is nice,ep082
1203,it's a Creekside bedroom okay where's,ep082
1206,the closet Wow look at this closet I,ep082
1209,would probably need the entire closet,ep082
1212,and we can blowin margin we're got a,ep082
1215,deal your negotiator so okay yeah this,ep082
1218,is I feel like I'm gonna be with losing,ep082
1221,that battle they also see four guest,ep082
1224,bedrooms it's a really good-size room,ep082
1227,yeah I like the little nook this it,ep082
1230,could be Saira's room,ep082
1233,so what do you guys think of the house,ep082
1236,it does have that dramatic entryway we,ep082
1239,could put a chandelier down it's got a,ep082
1242,high ceiling a lot of natural light,ep082
1245,makes it open the view I love the view,ep082
1248,yeah the view is to die for,ep082
1251,and the kitchen who is a good-sized,ep082
1254,kitchen I did like it yeah as the island,ep082
1257,that you wanted very large and that,ep082
1260,master bedroom oh that is beautiful too,ep082
1263,that closet,ep082
1266,yeah I mean and the bathroom the only,ep082
1269,thing is the backyards a little cramped,ep082
1272,and it doesn't have a pool and I really,ep082
1275,want well but I'm okay with that,ep082
1278,actually and you know the whole east,ep082
1281,facing door it's got southies,ep082
1284,overall I do like this house yeah but,ep082
1287,we've keep in mind that we do want to do,ep082
1290,a renovation and that's gonna cost a,ep082
1293,pretty penny and the houses are already,ep082
1296,on the high end of what I'm willing to,ep082
1299,spend at least we can't work around that,ep082
1302,now after three years of hunting they're,ep082
1305,ready to decide and it all comes down to,ep082
1308,an east-facing door no pool and a second,ep082
1311,story this is it this is the house yeah,ep082
1314,call AJ,ep082
1317,[Music],ep082
1320,with a budget of up to 1.5 million,ep082
1323,dollars Ruben and Molony have been,ep082
1326,looking for three years to find a family,ep082
1329,home in Anaheim Hills California now,ep082
1332,they're finally ready to decide their,ep082
1335,first option is a one and a half story,ep082
1338,Spanish ranch priced at one point three,ep082
1341,three million,ep082
1344,I like the ranch style they do have that,ep082
1347,second story just for the master I think,ep082
1350,it's a great compromise for us this is,ep082
1353,the only one out of the three of them,ep082
1356,that face directly to the east,ep082
1359,the view was killer yeah the entryway,ep082
1362,was dramatic kitchen was large and that,ep082
1365,Island but we'd have to do work and to,ep082
1368,the pool I like the pool we just need to,ep082
1371,take precaution the other home Rizal was,ep082
1374,the ranch and that was in the budget,ep082
1377,that you love yeah I love the frightly,ep082
1380,the best thing is it didn't have a pool,ep082
1383,unfortunately is that Chuy I wasn't the,ep082
1386,big fan the ceilings weren't high it was,ep082
1389,in a very dramatic actuate the door did,ep082
1392,not face East and a kitchen that was,ep082
1395,very small yeah there's no island but,ep082
1398,the master was also small oh the master,ep082
1401,bath that's step-down shower we would,ep082
1404,definitely have to gut that yeah there,ep082
1407,next option is a two-story contemporary,ep082
1410,priced at one point three one five,ep082
1413,million,ep082
1416,I like the two-story I did like the,ep082
1419,entryway enjoy romatic,ep082
1422,didn't have a pool I liked and the door,ep082
1425,did not face East in the kitchen I,ep082
1428,wasn't really feeling no we have to do a,ep082
1431,lot of renovations,ep082
1434,the ranch with the addition what do you,ep082
1437,think about that we can do so much with,ep082
1440,that it is on the higher end but look,ep082
1443,I'll tell you something I really like,ep082
1446,the house I know we we'd have to put in,ep082
1449,some work but that's the home that we,ep082
1452,wouldn't grow Alice and the door faces,ep082
1455,directly east yeah you know it's a,ep082
1458,positive blessing This Is It this is the,ep082
1461,house yep,ep082
1464,call AJ what is underneath there the,ep082
1467,listing price was 1.3 30 we settled with,ep082
1470,1.3 we're really looking forward to,ep082
1473,renovating and it'll take a couple,ep082
1476,months but once we move in we're gonna,ep082
1479,be pretty happy so what I really want to,ep082
1482,do the first thing has changed the,ep082
1485,flooring we want like the whole wood,ep082
1488,look I love the island but I'm gonna,ep082
1491,change the countertop and let me finish,ep082
1494,the cabinet's I know she wants to keep,ep082
1497,the mirrors we're keeping the mirrors,ep082
1500,I'm getting rid of the interior I am,ep082
1503,hoping that they break they may break,ep082
1506,but I get to design the bathroom and the,ep082
1509,office things out of 4200 square feet Oh,ep082
1512,compromise I compromise on the pool yeah,ep082
1515,so from a safety perspective we can be,ep082
1518,proactive and put the proper safety,ep082
1521,measures in place there's your stuff,ep082
1524,let's go the minute we stepped into this,ep082
1527,home I was like this set a minister a,ep082
1530,long tiring process but well worth it,ep082

99,his girlfriend Ashley and best friend,ep083
102,Chaz who also do a podcast with him are,ep083
105,going to live in the house and pay rent,ep083
108,which will cover some of them ears,ep083
111,mortgage so he's bringing them along to,ep083
114,advise communication I would describe a,ep083
117,mirror as a pretty easygoing guy my,ep083
120,nickname is chill god I'm excited I'm,ep083
123,chilling I'm upset I'm chilling this,ep083
126,house search would end probably the,ep083
129,first house and it would be like an as,ep083
132,is type situation where we would have to,ep083
135,kind of just work with it mom since he,ep083
138,is not picky oh we are a little bit more,ep083
141,picky that's true,ep083
144,Ashley had her way it probably be a lot,ep083
147,of space I have to have my own space or,ep083
150,else I will go nuts yeah and I would,ep083
153,drive them nuts yes so Amir's looking,ep083
156,for a spacious 4 bed 3 bath home and the,ep083
159,"$200,000 range I do like the features",ep083
162,it's a gorgeous house I prefer a,ep083
165,ranch-style house because I don't like,ep083
168,going upstairs that is a pet peeve of,ep083
171,mine I'm not so much a fan of the ranch,ep083
174,ashley prefers the coziness of a cottage,ep083
177,or a bungalow,ep083
180,I definitely love lots of windows lots,ep083
183,of natural light I like light colors a,ep083
186,front porch would be great I do like to,ep083
189,go outside and kind of breathe unnatural,ep083
192,air,ep083
195,sounds like a co-working space see,ep083
198,that's what I'm talking about,ep083
201,they'll also need a separate room to,ep083
204,record their podcasts yeah this is,ep083
207,perfect something that's open and people,ep083
210,can move around going to entertain huge,ep083
213,is very important yes we have a lot of,ep083
216,friends and family we have to be able to,ep083
219,entertain tez also wants to the garage,ep083
222,because he has a plug-in car I'm,ep083
225,thinking about putting like a little,ep083
228,garden like maybe in this corner some,ep083
231,plans anything we have to be in the city,ep083
234,I'm more so location location location,ep083
237,so I mean it's pretty extreme he wants,ep083
240,he wants access to recreation yes to,ep083
243,school and work yes to entertainment yes,ep083
246,so Chaz needs to be close to downtown oh,ep083
249,we could finish it look I went in mind,ep083
252,fixing up a house I can put a nail in,ep083
255,the wall among everything but some paint,ep083
258,on the walls you know,ep083

696,budget but it's totally updated we don't,ep083
699,have to do anything I know that they,ep083
702,were all pitching in but at the end of,ep083
705,the day I'm the one that's on the hook,ep083
708,for this house it has a roof so it you,ep083
711,know if it's raining or anything you,ep083
714,know I put my garden in this backyard,ep083
717,this is a great backyard back inside,ep083
720,they head to the first bedroom I like,ep083
723,the carpet inside that's pretty good,ep083
726,Muniz kind of small it's a little small,ep083
729,but I mean it's functional maybe podcast,ep083
732,room possibly that's a good point,ep083
735,this would be great for a guest here is,ep083
738,the second bedroom on the first level oh,ep083
741,wow this is nice it's a little it's a,ep083
744,little smaller than the other one is,ep083
747,really small it sound like a shared,ep083
750,bathroom so this bathroom would be,ep083
753,considered a jack-and-jill bathroom I,ep083
756,mean it's okay it's pretty basic and it,ep083
759,looks like it leads into an even smaller,ep083
762,bedroom this is really tiny this is like,ep083
765,an office thing this kid not yeah this,ep083
768,can't be a bedroom bedroom it is,ep083
771,considered a bedroom and it's the third,ep083
774,bedroom on this level you know maybe the,ep083
777,person has that room can also have an,ep083
780,office as well each as you can have both,ep083
783,bedrooms yeah I like nothing okay Amir I,ep083
786,know you weren't too excited about the,ep083
789,stairs not at all but when you get to,ep083
792,the top of the stairs what you think,ep083
795,not one of the rooms perfect this is a,ep083
798,really good space at this price point,ep083
801,this is what you get a move-in-ready,ep083
804,home yeah we definitely have to think,ep083
807,about it I mean the house is great the,ep083
810,location is great the living room dining,ep083
813,room it's a nice even flow of what the,ep083
816,house absolutely loved this house it's,ep083
819,move-in ready the kitchen's great,ep083
822,everything is upgraded in the upstairs,ep083
825,it's like a totally different house I,ep083
828,mean the downstairs though for me the,ep083
831,bedrooms kind of small it really tight,ep083
834,that's gonna be hard for me,ep083
837,that is true and it is kind of over our,ep083
840,budget way over budget by the way so now,ep083
843,Aamir's agent is taking them to see,ep083
846,something with a price tag that's easier,ep083
849,to swallow can't really beat the,ep083
852,location and I'm excited about that,ep083
855,[Music],ep083
858,yep you definitely need that practice,ep083
861,Atlanta Georgia engineer an avid,ep083
864,podcaster Amir is ready to buy his first,ep083
867,home his girlfriend Ashley and best,ep083
870,friend Chad will be moving into the new,ep083
873,house to share the cost so they're along,ep083
876,for the hunt they've seen a ranch that,ep083
879,"was well under his $200,000 budget but",ep083
882,although Amir likes the open field,ep083
885,it isn't close to downtown for Chaz and,ep083
888,Ashley would preferred not to have to,ep083
891,renovate the basement they also saw a,ep083
894,move-in-ready bungalow that Ashley likes,ep083
897,and it's in the heart of the city,ep083
900,ideal for Chaz but a mirror worries,ep083
903,about the hefty price tag can't really,ep083
906,beat the location I'm excited about that,ep083
909,it's very cottage tight first impression,ep083
912,of the house I like it nice little curb,ep083
915,appeal and it's a very spacious deck oh,ep083
918,so as soon as I walk in the door I see,ep083
921,stairs that's one thing I don't want I,ep083
924,love the fireplace the high ceilings the,ep083
927,big windows,ep083

1149,there are a larger space so that we all,ep083
1152,can cook and use it it would totally,ep083
1155,need to be gutted at this point can we,ep083
1158,afford that absolutely not okay I don't,ep083
1161,see how we're gonna be able to afford,ep083
1164,this and do renovations that we need,ep083
1167,with multiple options on the table,ep083
1170,a mirror we'll have to prioritize,ep083
1173,between his need to stay within budget,ep083
1176,Ashley's love of move-in-ready and Chas,ep083
1179,wanting to be close to downtown this is,ep083
1182,a special episode big decision we've,ep083
1185,been looking at some houses huge,ep083
1188,"decision with a budget of $200,000",ep083
1191,podcaster Amir has been searching,ep083
1194,Atlanta Georgia for his first home with,ep083
1197,the help of girlfriend Ashley and best,ep083
1200,friend Chaz he's ready to make a,ep083
1203,decision so big decision we've been,ep083
1206,looking at some houses huge decision how,ep083
1209,did you guys feel about the 1955 ranch,ep083
1212,one hundred and eighty-five thousand,ep083
1215,dollar house that kitchen was renovated,ep083
1218,it was really open and big it didn't,ep083
1221,have a really nice master a basement was,ep083
1224,crazy but it was very private you could,ep083
1227,have your own little kingdom down there,ep083
1230,I mean Kingdom that dungeon under budget,ep083
1233,of course but within renovations to,ep083
1236,their basement waits and once you know,ep083
1239,the location wasn't too close but I,ep083
1242,think we could have made it worse,ep083
1245,I am locational location was what was,ep083
1248,close around there I have no idea,ep083
1251,I really love the 1925 style craftsman I,ep083
1254,think that one is my favorite,ep083
1257,and all I'm keep thinking about is,ep083
1260,"$240,000 kitchen his legs have the",ep083
1263,stainless steel is great and there's a,ep083
1266,great backyard location it's not bad I,ep083
1269,mean I know we are a little bit over the,ep083
1272,budget wait overt advise it okay there,ep083
1275,was absolutely nothing that we needed,ep083
1278,two hundred and forty thousand I mean,ep083
1281,that's a lot you guys at the end of the,ep083
1284,day I have to take on this,ep083
1287,responsibility I'm kind of nervous about,ep083
1290,it how do you guys feel about that,ep083
1293,bungalow,ep083
1296,"it's $215,000 it's a little bit over our",ep083
1299,budget that was it was okay it has a,ep083
1302,nice curb appeal I'll give it that,ep083
1305,it was very cute looking right into the,ep083
1308,neighborhood is great and all the rooms,ep083
1311,are equally sized I don't like the,ep083
1314,upstairs I mean the kitchen wasn't,ep083
1317,upgraded it was very outdated it was it,ep083
1320,was white old white cabinets I say the,ep083
1323,two storey bungalow okay no you didn't,ep083
1326,like the kitchen no but we can renovate,ep083
1329,it mm-hmm and then sass and location,ep083
1332,beautiful and it does have everything,ep083
1335,that we need was for a space alright so,ep083
1338,Kay we told tabatha we got it yes pistil,ep083
1341,all the way down amazing we can pick it,ep083
1344,up or something,ep083
1347,two three,ep083
1350,so moving the bottle we can go so far,ep083
1353,we've changed out some fixtures done,ep083
1356,some really good cleaning and try to,ep083
1359,find a place for everything I think,ep083
1362,today I didn't get my ranch but we did,ep083
1365,kind of fall under budget a little bit,ep083
1368,the listing price was two hundred and,ep083
1371,fifteen thousand dollars and we got it,ep083
1374,"for 100 95,000 so I'm really happy with",ep083
1377,that,ep083
1380,that's kitchen stuff yeah just getting a,ep083
1383,little unpacked but I like about the,ep083
1386,home is that it just makes sense for,ep083
1389,everybody we all get our own space no,ep083
1392,privacy we can be close to each other,ep083
1395,but I also stay out of each other's way,ep083
1398,which is perfect finally got your own,ep083
1401,space you excited yeah you know I'm more,ep083
1404,excited when we get this kitchen,ep083
1407,renovated definitely compromise on that,ep083
1410,ugly kitchen so we do plan on doing,ep083
1413,renovations in the future hopefully that,ep083
1416,will happen sooner than later but for,ep083
1419,now I can I can work around it it feels,ep083
1422,great to be living in our own for the,ep083
1425,first time and just starting our new,ep083
1428,life the house-hunting process was very,ep083
1431,challenging it's free of us it was kind,ep083
1434,of hard meeting all those requirements,ep083
1437,we're very thankful that we found this,ep083
1440,house and it's over now we can just move,ep083
1443,in yeah I am very nervous about stepping,ep083
1446,on my own and he's a lot of,ep083
1449,responsibility it's my first house but,ep083
1452,you know I'm happy to go through the,ep083

93,million-dollar view in the tiny house,ep084
96,right Wow look at this beautiful a known,ep084
99,fee fee for about nine years I'm trying,ep084
102,to help Fifi find the best possible,ep084
105,arrangement for her situation sometimes,ep084
108,I feel fee fees all over the place and,ep084
111,she might call me one day with an idea,ep084
114,and the next day something totally,ep084
117,different she needs to focus are you,ep084
120,sure you want to do this yeah my mind is,ep084
123,set on something like that's it it's,ep084
126,happening all right,ep084
129,this whole tiny thing is definitely,ep084
132,happening I'm going tiny for sure,ep084
135,definite jailbreakers and the tiny house,ep084
138,for me would be it has to be 275 square,ep084
141,feet or smaller that's like my walk-in,ep084
144,closet I'm afraid of heights,ep084
147,so ladders Heights like that it's just,ep084
150,the big now in my life I mean you do,ep084
153,realize sometimes they're high ceilings,ep084
156,where there's a love there are these,ep084
159,little things and they're called fairs,ep084
162,the same thing it's not she's got issues,ep084
165,when it comes to style Fifi wants,ep084
168,something beachy yet modern clean fine,ep084
171,lines gray with a bit of glitz my ideal,ep084
174,kitchen must have white cabinets with,ep084
177,just a little bit of sparkle a little,ep084
180,bit of shag a little bit of fluff,ep084
183,it's Fifi's world some people tell me,ep084
186,I'm a diva but I think just a little bit,ep084
189,of a diva not too much give me the three,ep084
192,most important items that you want on,ep084
195,this property,ep084
198,has to have a washer/dryer I am NOT,ep084
201,lugging my stuff to the laundromat I had,ep084
204,to do that and it drove me crazy and I,ep084
207,will never do that again,ep084
210,tub bubbles yes bubbles definitely,ep084
213,bubbles standard toilet small appliances,ep084
216,small bathroom vanity I don't foresee,ep084
219,myself needing a full-size vanity that,ep084
222,just doesn't make sense to me,ep084
225,don't want wood interior like that has,ep084
228,to have drywall it's actually more than,ep084
231,three items but it's okay my friends and,ep084
234,family think I've lost my mind and,ep084
237,there's no way I could possibly live in,ep084
240,a tiny house I'll show them fefe is,ep084
243,working with tiny house builder and,ep084
246,expert bob pleurisy Oh we'll be showing,ep084
249,her several different types of tiny,ep084
252,options he builds amazing tiny houses,ep084
255,like his style I just love everything he,ep084
258,does so it's a no-brainer,ep084
261,first up Bob showing Fifi one of his,ep084
264,tiny mobile models that has a lot of the,ep084
267,items on her wish list,ep084
270,this is the largest house that we build,ep084
273,this house is actually 400 square feet,ep084
276,on the first floor I love it it's the,ep084
279,perfect beach cottage I can see it in,ep084
282,North Carolina the colors the porch the,ep084
285,roofline I love it how much is it this,ep084
288,house costs ninety five thousand Oh,ep084
291,fifteen grand over your budget do we,ep084
294,even bother taking a look at it yes it's,ep084
297,beautiful it's perfect this is very,ep084
300,customizable this house has a lot of,ep084
303,upgrades we can work to get that price,ep084
306,down I honestly think this is a waste of,ep084
309,"time to go into this house is $15,000",ep084
312,over her budget oh this is fancy,ep084
315,"my $85,000 it better be how tall are the",ep084
318,ceilings the ceilings are about 11 and a,ep084
321,half feet tall,ep084
324,I love the drywall it's perfect,ep084
327,I really want a tiny house with a,ep084
330,fireplace this is perfect where would I,ep084
333,work though can you work on this this,ep084
336,fine countertop this is nice this is,ep084
339,actually all Carrara marble that's for,ep084
342,the 95 thousand what my dream countertop,ep084
345,you can get that budget down if we,ep084
348,eliminate the countertop food for,ep084
351,thought,ep084
354,little tiny drawers here never seen,ep084
357,these before those are so cute,ep084
360,I love those these are actually backlit,ep084
363,with lighting that's pretty cool how,ep084
366,much is that that's a couple hundred,ep084
369,dollars I don't need them okay I'm gonna,ep084
372,make a progress bar I see that these are,ep084
375,white and full-sized appliances do they,ep084
378,come in stainless and maybe smaller,ep084
381,would that be any cheaper we can make,ep084
384,them smaller but then we're just gonna,ep084
387,increase the price or if not make it the,ep084
390,same by doing stainless you do have a,ep084
393,washer and dryer behind you so that's,ep084
396,kind of cool I like that,ep084
399,oh I see a bathtub but the vanity is a,ep084
402,little too large,ep084
405,what do you mean tiny want a small,ep084
408,vanity I don't understand how you're,ep084
411,gonna get any smaller than that him the,ep084
414,tub is perfect standard toilet and some,ep084
417,storage,ep084
420,could use your space back there ooh,ep084
423,pockets are my guys I sit there and,ep084

519,[Applause],ep084
522,I'm excited about the tiny house I know,ep084
525,you are that's why I'm here,ep084
528,entrepreneur Fifi has left corporate,ep084
531,"America behind sold her 1,800",ep084
534,square-foot house and is going tiny in,ep084
537,Shallotte North Carolina her friend Paul,ep084
540,is along to keep her focused and rein in,ep084
543,her lengthy wish list so far tiny house,ep084
546,expert Bob Clarissa has shown her a 400,ep084
549,square foot option that's her modern,ep084
552,beachy style well it's got all the bells,ep084
555,and whistles she could ask for it's well,ep084
558,"over her $80,000 budget and she's",ep084
561,skeptical of the lofts ladder Bob now,ep084
564,wants her to see a smaller option on,ep084
567,wheels that's more within her budget the,ep084
570,cabinetry the exterior siding it has a,ep084
573,lot of character I'm not too crazy about,ep084
576,it I don't love the metal at the bottom,ep084
579,it doesn't go with the beach cottage yo,ep084
582,but can it be painted we can change the,ep084
585,exterior color keep in mind this house,ep084
588,was built custom so any changes that,ep084
591,we're gonna make to the home they're,ep084
594,gonna be additional costs okay so what's,ep084
597,the price price of this house is fifty,ep084
600,nine thousand oh wow that's good how big,ep084
603,is it,ep084
606,196 square feet that's perfect oh,ep084
609,there's a lot of wood I like this,ep084
612,my style is glam glitz and I'm not,ep084
615,really seeing it in this tiny house it,ep084
618,definitely feels like a pine box we,ep084
621,could always put drywall on top yeah all,ep084
624,right that would work this bench has a,ep084
627,table that sits kind of over it and then,ep084
630,you have this whole area for your,ep084
633,workspace it really makes the kitchen,ep084
636,and workspace kind of work together very,ep084
639,clever design yes it is clever I do love,ep084
642,the stainless oven it's a perfect size,ep084
645,what is this this is a tri fuel,ep084
648,refrigerator,ep084
651,it runs on propane it can also run on,ep084
654,120 and 12 volt electric so literally,ep084
657,you can never go warm with your food but,ep084
660,it's also ugly and it's not stainless I,ep084
663,think this is a great tiny house might,ep084
666,not have everything to fefe looking for,ep084
669,it but no house is perfect and the price,ep084
672,is right you can swap these panels out,ep084
675,very in,ep084
678,expensively two stainless Haga and we,ep084
681,still under budget so that's doable,ep084
684,oh look at this little tiny vanity,ep084
687,you're gonna like this but we can't fit,ep084
690,I like this this is perfect,ep084
693,you could really multitask in this,ep084
696,bathroom like go to the bathroom brush,ep084
699,your teeth and shower at the same time,ep084
702,no tub and net oh I don't think that'll,ep084
705,work there's a nice rain head shower so,ep084
708,it's not like the shower heads right in,ep084
711,your face give it a shot there's no door,ep084
714,here so I'm just gonna walk away you,ep084
717,know is there no bathroom door well you,ep084
720,have a curtain I'm for the bathroom oh,ep084
723,the bathroom is a curtain as well,ep084
726,there's no door I don't know about those,ep084
729,guys is this a closet actually the,ep084
732,original owners their children actually,ep084
735,slept in here I know they're actually,ep084
738,quite spacious or I could just pull it,ep084
741,all out and make it a closet storage,ep084
744,format now you're being creative you can,ep084
747,sleep here want her to go tiny,ep084
750,there you go this is a lot of tiny as,ep084
753,you're gonna get I see two lofts and no,ep084
756,way to get to them oh you didn't want a,ep084
759,ladder trim less you know I don't want,ep084
762,to just forward where are you going it,ep084
765,was like some same ninja like since,ep084
768,you're up there samurai how does it look,ep084
771,there's a lot of space this could work,ep084
774,you're just gonna have to get creative,ep084
777,or we can just get a set of stairs I,ep084
780,like that I like that idea this whole no,ep084
783,I'm not doing that,ep084
786,[Music],ep084
789,so are you feeling well I'm not too,ep084
792,crazy about the size of the bathroom,ep084
795,there's no bathtub in there it's very,ep084
798,woody but there's no ladder and it's a,ep084
801,plus for you it is it is the table was,ep084
804,great for office space and we're under,ep084
807,budget here so I'm with the extra money,ep084
810,that you might be able to make some of,ep084
813,these changes to tailor it to what,ep084
816,you're looking for but it's only 200,ep084
819,square feet so there's only so much you,ep084
822,could do so just keep that in mind I,ep084
825,don't know Bob is taking Fifi to see a,ep084
828,house that's more her style but you may,ep084
831,still have to compromise this is a big,ep084
834,now,ep084
837,[Music],ep084
840,oh look at that you and Cheney things I,ep084
843,like Sparkle has bling,ep084
846,I like crystal I like Pam with the help,ep084
849,of her friend Paul self-proclaimed diva,ep084
852,Fifi is going tiny in Shallotte North,ep084
855,"Carolina with $80,000 to spend tiny",ep084
858,house builder and expert Bob Clarissa,ep084
861,has shown her a home that is ideal but,ep084
864,she's not a fan of the bathroom vanity,ep084
867,and most importantly the place is out of,ep084
870,her price range next was an under budget,ep084
873,farmhouse style option although it's not,ep084
876,her modern Beach look she has the money,ep084
879,to make changes however the lofts were,ep084
882,not accessible without the biggest no on,ep084
885,her list a ladder,ep084
888,since ladders are a concern Bob is,ep084
891,taking her to one of his customizable,ep084
894,models on wheels that comes with a full,ep084
897,set of stairs it's a hundred and ninety,ep084
900,square feet on the first floor and then,ep084
903,you have two individual lofts that are,ep084
906,both 70 square feet okay the coolest,ep084
909,thing is that this house starts off at,ep084
912,57 5 Wow that's under your budget it is,ep084
915,still not quite the beach cottage I was,ep084
918,looking for though relax I'm just the,ep084
921,books by the vinyl cover the outside,ep084
924,really doesn't represent what's inside,ep084
927,let me show you oh it's pretty like it I,ep084
930,love it I see drywall I see stairs I,ep084
933,love the dark floors keep in mind this,ep084
936,unit does have a lot of upgrades you can,ep084
939,pick what kind of color tops whether you,ep084
942,want stairs or a ladder really it's just,ep084
945,gonna depend we're just you have to see,ep084
948,what you like and find out what that,ep084
951,price is gonna be what are you thinking,ep084
954,the cabinet color I'm not crazy about,ep084
957,them I prefer white and you know like,ep084
960,glam hardware Krystal hardware something,ep084
963,sparkly okay so white cabinets are a,ep084
966,standard color selection so there's no,ep084
969,price for upgrade there I am happy about,ep084
972,the oven you know I mean I'm single I,ep084
975,don't need a full-size so I love this,ep084
978,this is a big now you're getting stairs,ep084
981,so the only reason,ep084
984,ladders so that you can access this loft,ep084
987,for storage what about another staircase,ep084
990,we can do that but we would be blocking,ep084
993,the entrance into the bathroom is that a,ep084
996,deal-breaker with the ladder it would,ep084
999,just be a little space I won't use if,ep084
1002,you don't need it just hang it here and,ep084
1005,leave it our way let's try it louder is,ep084
1008,gone find it a little weird cuz I don't,ep084
1011,see much of a difference between the,ep084
1014,stairs and the ladder but to Isha spawn,ep084
1017,okay vanity is a little too large and it,ep084
1020,has an RV toilet I want standard one,ep084
1023,whether you choose an RV toilet or a,ep084
1026,regular toilet it's all within the,ep084
1029,budget okay oh there's no tub I only see,ep084
1032,a shower there both within the base,ep084
1035,price the tub is actually a foot longer,ep084
1038,so you'll actually have a wider bathroom,ep084
1041,oh that's good I love it,ep084
1044,I don't see a washer or a fridge the,ep084
1047,washing machine fits right underneath,ep084
1050,here and then also the refrigerator can,ep084
1053,fit right here this is a living room,ep084
1056,kind of office this could be everything,ep084
1059,you want to this yeah that's it this is,ep084
1062,huge this is like I can touch all the,ep084
1065,wall this is your office this is your,ep084
1068,couch this is your bed I work from home,ep084
1071,I need somewhere to store me pack it's,ep084
1074,not a living in office,ep084
1077,okay what about fireplace how about one,ep084
1080,of those that hang on the wall how much,ep084
1083,is that gonna cost,ep084
1086,those fireplaces it run a couple hundred,ep084
1089,dollars so over here is the master loft,ep084
1092,let's check,ep084
1095,oh no you don't sleep standing up do you,ep084
1098,no but you do have to move around like,ep084
1101,you know you do have to factor in that,ep084
1104,there will be a mattress there as well,ep084
1107,and I don't know what do you think I do,ep084
1110,like the floors the stairs I also like,ep084
1113,that there's drywall in there but it's,ep084
1116,not the beach cottage exterior do not,ep084
1119,like the kitchen the color and there's,ep084
1122,no office space water we could customize,ep084
1125,right you know I do think we're gonna,ep084
1128,have to customize a lot of things on,ep084
1131,this house and I definitely think that,ep084
1134,we could stay within the budget on a,ep084
1137,scale of one to ten I would say this,ep084
1140,tiny house is about a five or six with,ep084
1143,several very different tiny options to,ep084
1146,choose from it's time for Fifi to make a,ep084
1149,decision I think I know,ep084
1152,[Music],ep084
1155,I think it gets to this me too I might,ep084
1158,go tiny then I just Park it there with,ep084
1161,"an $80,000 budget online business owner",ep084
1164,fee fee is going tiny in the coastal,ep084
1167,city of Shallotte North Carolina after,ep084
1170,seeing many choices it's time for Fifi,ep084
1173,to decide which house she will call home,ep084
1176,there's a tiny decision it's a big,ep084
1179,decision,ep084
1182,first was a 400 square foot customizable,ep084
1185,"model listed for $95,000 I love the",ep084
1188,beach cottage way over your budget I,ep084
1191,know but I had the first foot bedroom I,ep084
1194,like the floors,ep084
1197,though I was looking for dark I actually,ep084
1200,do like the ones in there countertops,ep084
1203,were amazing but I do think there would,ep084
1206,be a lot of wasted space because I'm not,ep084
1209,going up that thing good thing with the,ep084
1212,steps to the thing a 196 square foot,ep084
1215,farmhouse was fifty nine thousand,ep084
1218,dollars then wooden one the pine box on,ep084
1221,wheels,ep084
1224,yeah a lot of nice detail up in there,ep084
1227,but that's just not my style it's under,ep084
1230,you Bundys it is drywall over this wood,ep084
1233,I just don't know how it gets it a lot,ep084
1236,it's easy actually you did last was a,ep084
1239,330 square foot tiny model that at,ep084
1242,"$57,500 could be customized it was",ep084
1245,modern I didn't like that I had to,ep084
1248,drywall I wasn't crazy about the kitchen,ep084
1251,cabinets they weren't necessarily white,ep084
1254,I didn't love the countertops the,ep084
1257,bathroom was an okay size at a ladder,ep084
1260,but I had stairs yeah just do I need,ep084
1263,"$2,000 under your budget which is great",ep084
1266,it is maybe we can make these changes,ep084
1269,and still find what you're looking for,ep084
1272,what is it gonna be to Sita,ep084
1275,[Music],ep084
1278,I think I know you think I think I'm,ep084
1281,gonna go with the modern blue one,ep084
1284,Bob said it was customizable so I think,ep084
1287,you know few minor changes can totally,ep084
1290,see myself in there I'm happy for you,ep084
1293,Thanks I've been in my tiny house now,ep084

1302,dishwasher and beach cottage exterior,ep084
1305,but I still had a fun color door and,ep084
1308,it's totally modern on the inside so I'm,ep084
1311,happy I love a counter granite got my,ep084

168,here and maybe have an apartment for a,ep085
171,while until we found a house but,ep085
174,unfortunately none were available and,ep085
177,the only thing we could find is this,ep085
180,extended stay hotel which is just one,ep085
183,tiny room it's been five weeks too long,ep085
186,that we've been here we don't have a lot,ep085
189,of time we've already started the kids,ep085
192,in school we're staying in this small,ep085
195,hotel and it's kind of like where should,ep085
198,we live with every house that we pick I,ep085
201,I tend to look for some kind of an,ep085
204,upgrade now that we are here in Cape,ep085
207,Girardeau I know exactly what I want and,ep085
210,I'm not gonna stop until I find it this,ep085
213,is kind of brainstorm as to what you,ep085
216,guys are thinking helping them on their,ep085
219,searches broker Elaine Edgar for me the,ep085
222,price range throughout six hundred,ep085
225,"thousand my budget is $900,000 I think",ep085
228,we're gonna we're gonna need it to spend,ep085
231,to get everything that we want I want to,ep085
234,find an older ranch-style house that,ep085
237,someone has already gone in and done all,ep085
240,the upgrades to and we can just move,ep085
243,right in I really love modern,ep085
246,contemporary very discrete lines ideal,ep085
249,it for me is like a two-story I would,ep085
252,like to have a basement no one ever goes,ep085
255,in the basement we've never had a,ep085
258,walkout even if we have a walkout,ep085
261,basement half the time I'm ducking,ep085
264,through the whole basement because I'm,ep085
267,like with tall ceilings you're okay,ep085
270,"maybe probably 5,000 square foot and",ep085
273,above house two thousand two to three,ep085
276,thousand yeah instead of having a bigger,ep085
279,house maybe we find a house with more,ep085
282,land like at least an acre or two acres,ep085
285,what are you gonna do with that land we,ep085
288,love nature I don't love nature one,ep085
291,request that I know is gonna sound super,ep085
294,weird I really want to have two separate,ep085
297,kitchens in Asia it's very common to,ep085
300,have a wet kitchen and a dry kitchen so,ep085
303,it's basically two different areas where,ep085
306,like all the dirty kind of cooking,ep085
309,is in a like a little enclosed kitchen,ep085
312,area and all the like dry cooking you,ep085
315,know baking is kind of done more out in,ep085
318,the open,ep085
321,pool would be great I would love to have,ep085
324,to laundry rooms really - washer and,ep085
327,dryers really just you know like some,ep085
330,way to separate the laundry from the,ep085
333,pool you know with all the all the,ep085
336,chlorine and everything a home office,ep085
339,and short commute for Nuri,ep085
342,and a location close to neighbors in,ep085
345,town for rah hey round out their list we,ep085
348,know that we're making this not easy for,ep085
351,you which is a bit of a challenge huge,ep085
354,challenge of trying to find what I want,ep085
357,versus what Murray wants I think I I'm,ep085
360,gonna owe her some kind of a spa day,ep085
363,when this is all done first up a,ep085
366,single-story ranch farm house for rah,ep085
369,hay but with the acreage Murray wants,ep085
372,Wow look at all this land it's so open,ep085
375,so private yeah I don't know this is,ep085
378,like ten minutes from work I mean this,ep085
381,place is way too far out I didn't want,ep085
384,to live on a farm,ep085
387,it is not modern at all oh wow I love,ep085
390,the porch it's not a pond over there Wow,ep085
393,Elaine this house is really nice this,ep085
396,range farmhouse it has four bedrooms,ep085
399,three and a half baths comes with five,ep085

453,bedrooms and bathroom I want to show you,ep085
456,the laundry room like the door oh yes,ep085
459,very neat but there's no sink no counter,ep085
462,space they really should have made the,ep085
465,laundry room a lot bigger with a sink,ep085
468,and some counter space especially since,ep085
471,there's no second laundry room Neri,ep085
474,here's your space wow this is a really,ep085
477,nice offer,ep085
480,okay I love the view good close the door,ep085

504,do love the wood in here though I don't,ep085

540,see the walkout basement I just don't,ep085
543,see it walking out to a swimming pool we,ep085

555,swimming in the pond if you're not,ep085

564,plumbing all of the infrastructure is,ep085
567,there the hookups are there that might,ep085
570,be something fun down the road maybe but,ep085
573,I think we were thinking too on the on,ep085
576,the same floor okay well of course you,ep085
579,could do another,ep085
582,down here cuz you wanted this to longer,ep085

612,lot of time down here I love the gym I,ep085
615,love the front porch this stocks up,ep085
618,really well with what I'm looking for it,ep085
621,is a ranch I love the master bath with,ep085
624,the fireplace that that is a really,ep085
627,really cool touch it's got a walkout,ep085
630,basement but no swimming pool and I,ep085
633,don't have my second kitchen or my,ep085
636,second laundry room and I don't want any,ep085
639,kind of renovation or project to have to,ep085
642,add one 10 minutes um it work but it's,ep085
645,probably 10 minutes to get to the,ep085
648,neighbor's house too,ep085
651,it's like 5 acres it's about four and a,ep085
654,half acres too much the price of this,ep085
657,house is way over the limit that I,ep085
660,wanted to go to the exterior style I'm,ep085
663,not really feeling it it's not,ep085
666,contemporary I wanted to story it's just,ep085
669,not really my style at all now they're,ep085
672,heading to a place that's more Nury,ep085
675,style that's two-story that's what I'm,ep085
678,talking about,ep085
681,well I mean it's a nice cute town people,ep085
684,are really nice Murray and raha are,ep085
687,moving to Cape Girardeau Missouri they,ep085
690,want a large family home but he prefer,ep085
693,"to keep the budget at $600,000 while",ep085
696,"she's willing to push it up to 900,000",ep085
699,so far they've seen a move-in-ready,ep085
702,ranch farmhouse exactly what raha wants,ep085
705,she was concerned by the isolated,ep085
708,location but Nuri loved the acreage he,ep085
711,didn't love the price though and he'd,ep085
714,really prefer a two-story so now they're,ep085
717,seeing a home that's closer to neighbors,ep085
720,for rah Hey but that's also still close,ep085
723,to his job well look at the house,ep085
726,that's two-story that's what I'm talking,ep085
729,about it's not my ranch oh my gosh what,ep085
732,why are there stairs right in front of,ep085
735,the door I like it look how grand it is,ep085
738,oh I just this is exactly what I don't,ep085
741,want this house is two-story which is,ep085
744,what I'm looking for this house is a,ep085
747,traditional two-story home it fits on,ep085
750,almost an acre there's four bedrooms and,ep085
753,five baths the asking price for this,ep085
756,"house is 600 $19,900 oh wow into the",ep085
759,kitchen Oh like this no this is nice,ep085
762,no this none of this I like it the black,ep085
765,marble I think there's a nice contrast I,ep085
768,like the kitchen the black countertops,ep085
771,are hideous I really like light white,ep085
774,quartz clean countertops could you see,ep085
777,yourself making this kitchen into what,ep085
780,you want there's definitely potential I,ep085
783,like the fact that there's two sinks in,ep085
786,this kitchen so I could do the whole,ep085
789,wet/dry kitchen oh that catwalk you have,ep085
792,to love that catwalk kind of gives a,ep085
795,majestic feel you know no I'm not,ep085
798,looking for a catwalk in my house this,ep085
801,room's making my eyes hurt let me show,ep085
804,you something step into this sunroom Wow,ep085
807,yeah I love this space this is by far so,ep085
810,far my favorite part of the house okay,ep085
813,so step out here to this great patio,ep085
816,area this is very nice except I don't,ep085
819,see a pool Elaine and there's really no,ep085
822,space back there to even install a pool,ep085
825,so that is a huge negative there's a,ep085
828,basketball court honey do you think that,ep085
831,the basketball court I would not be,ep085
834,willing to give up for a pool that would,ep085
837,be one major compromise we would have to,ep085
840,make they head back inside through a,ep085
843,side door what's this is your this is,ep085
846,your laundry room it's not a laundry,ep085
849,room this is like a laundry closet,ep085
852,please tell me Elena there's another,ep085
855,laundry room in this house there is not,ep085
858,another laundry room in this house this,ep085
861,is it this is it your office nuri I do,ep085
864,love the fireplace and I see there's,ep085
867,like a built-in bookcase but there's no,ep085
870,door and here is the master bedroom,ep085
873,it's got a lot of space you have great,ep085
876,built-ins a walk-in closet Wow Lane this,ep085
879,is huge then they head upstairs to the,ep085
882,left is the first of the upstairs,ep085
885,bedrooms then across the catwalk are two,ep085
888,more this is actually a really nice,ep085
891,space here is a really neat,ep085
894,jack-and-jill because they can have,ep085
897,their own that is perfect no more,ep085
900,morning fights the kids would love this,ep085
903,and then of course this would be the,ep085
906,other bedroom very nice size and the two,ep085
909,windows well I absolutely love the,ep085
912,sunroom that's my favorite room in the,ep085
915,house,ep085
918,I love having two stories that's a,ep085
921,really nice aspect the Jack and Jill,ep085
924,that would be completely ideal I love,ep085
927,the price of the house the kitchen,ep085
930,doesn't really have the wet-dry kitchen,ep085
933,but at least it's got the two sinks I,ep085
936,was really kind of looking forward to,ep085
939,having a pool it's definitely not my,ep085
942,ranch since rahi is pushing hard for a,ep085
945,single-story ranch their brokers lined,ep085
948,up another option honey look I love it,ep085
951,[Music],ep085
954,I found some pictures of this house,ep085
957,raaah hey and Nuri are hunting for a,ep085
960,house in Cape Girardeau Missouri he,ep085
963,"wants to spend $600,000 but she's",ep085
966,"leaning toward 900,000 so far they've",ep085
969,seen a pricey move-in-ready ranch,ep085
972,farmhouse for raw hay and a much less,ep085
975,expensive two-story home for Nuri,ep085
978,but neither had Rajas pool now they're,ep085
981,heading to another option look I love it,ep085
984,this is my ranch this one is close to,ep085
987,town and neighbors for rah hey but it's,ep085
990,a full 25 minutes - nerese job this is a,ep085
993,way entryway that I am talking about as,ep085
996,you can see it's a ranch house it has,ep085
999,four bedrooms five and a half baths this,ep085
1002,house is listed at 929 thousand let's,ep085
1005,see if we can work out let's go ahead,ep085
1008,and step in here into the main this is,ep085
1011,nice I like the openness the kitchen,ep085
1014,flows into this room they have the,ep085
1017,island that I like - I really really,ep085
1020,like the countertops,ep085
1023,I love the farmhouse sink Oh what is,ep085
1026,this step in there tell me what you,ep085
1029,think,ep085
1032,Wow okay this is nice but this is kind,ep085
1035,of the second kitchen that you mentioned,ep085
1038,not really a kitchen there's no sink or,ep085
1041,like countertop stove but I don't know,ep085
1044,hey guys let's step on out here and take,ep085
1047,a look at part of the outdoor space,ep085
1050,rah hey what do you see here this is,ep085
1053,fabulous honey this is a pool that I,ep085
1056,have been dreaming about this property,ep085
1059,actually is 1.3 acres this is way more,ep085
1062,land than I want I kind of like this,ep085
1065,amount of land I think this is a good,ep085
1068,size they head back in and see one of,ep085
1071,the bedrooms on the main level,ep085
1074,interesting I think could work for,ep085
1077,Kamal's bet I think he would actually,ep085
1080,really like that they look in on the,ep085
1083,main floor laundry you make a lot of,ep085
1086,dirty clothes I need a lot of space in,ep085
1089,fact two of them really and then head to,ep085
1092,the master bedroom Wow,ep085
1095,oh very nice lots of windows I like that,ep085
1098,come on in here why is this showstopper,ep085
1101,right here really nice very big you,ep085
1104,would have your own sink area I would,ep085
1107,have my own oh my gosh this is my dream,ep085
1110,closet look at all these drawers honey,ep085
1113,if you have something on the top or a,ep085
1116,second shelf would you be able to get it,ep085
1119,no but you could that's what you're,ep085
1122,there for honey,ep085
1125,but what we need I think it's way too,ep085
1128,much and it's three hundred,ep085
1131,thousand-plus above my limit I'm not,ep085
1134,okay with that at all,ep085
1137,they make their way down to the finished,ep085
1140,basement even though you see a nice open,ep085
1143,concept here there are two other,ep085
1146,bedrooms and two full baths I really,ep085
1149,don't like the idea of having one of our,ep085
1152,kids down here by themselves that,ep085
1155,doesn't make me feel very safe they look,ep085
1158,in on two bedrooms then check out some,ep085
1161,additional bonus room what are we gonna,ep085
1164,do with this space honey potentially use,ep085
1167,this as an office maybe oh my goodness,ep085
1170,my second laundry room this is perfect,ep085
1173,for the pool staff I don't know too much,ep085
1176,too much we don't need all this,ep085
1179,[Music],ep085
1182,I love the doorway I love the grand,ep085
1185,entrance I love all the land acre and a,ep085
1188,half I think it's perfect it's a little,ep085
1191,too much land for me but I love the pool,ep085
1194,I love that this house has two laundry,ep085
1197,rooms that's exactly what I'm looking,ep085
1200,for,ep085
1203,the master bathroom in that closet I've,ep085
1206,never seen such a closet that's a dream,ep085
1209,I don't like that there are two bedrooms,ep085
1212,in the basement it's not modern this,ep085
1215,house is at least 25 minutes from work,ep085
1218,that's too far the bottom line is the,ep085
1221,price the cost of this house is,ep085
1224,ridiculous,ep085
1227,it's even above my wife's limit so now,ep085
1230,it's time to decide will they prioritize,ep085
1233,Rajas ranch-style and pool or Nuri's,ep085
1236,lower budget not an easy decision,ep085
1239,no raha and nuri have between 600 and,ep085
1242,900 thousand dollars to spend on a new,ep085
1245,family home now it's time to decide,ep085
1248,let's make a decision so the farmhouse,ep085
1251,seven hundred ninety nine thousand what,ep085
1254,are you thinking I absolutely love the,ep085
1257,porch that offers Wow I really like it,ep085
1260,that bathtub with the fireplace yeah,ep085
1263,that was a nice touch yeah but honey,ep085
1266,there's no swimming pool it's like 10,ep085
1269,minutes from work it's 10 minutes from,ep085
1272,our next-door neighbor with as much,ep085
1275,travel as you do if anything happens to,ep085
1278,the kids we would be like 20 minutes,ep085
1281,from the closest anything that two-story,ep085
1284,traditional at six hundred nineteen,ep085
1287,thousand nine it's the least expensive,ep085
1290,house yes which gives us all kinds of,ep085
1293,room to make it exactly what we would,ep085
1296,want that sunroom that was my favorite,ep085
1299,room in the house and it was really,ep085
1302,close to the neighbors and I like that,ep085
1305,you have a honey that office or lack,ep085
1308,thereof to the side for me it was more,ep085
1311,like a library we'd have to do a major,ep085
1314,major renovation we are left with the,ep085
1317,ranch listed for nine hundred and twenty,ep085
1320,nine thousand dollars that pool is,ep085
1323,amazing and it's my ranch even though,ep085
1326,the kitchen doesn't have like a wet and,ep085
1329,dry kitchen it is a really great space,ep085
1332,it is not my two-story style at all that,ep085
1335,one has two bedrooms who on the main,ep085
1338,floor and two in the basement which,ep085
1341,would mean one of our kids would be in,ep085
1344,the basement by themselves but it was,ep085
1347,really close to the neighbors and I like,ep085
1350,that I mean that's over both of our,ep085
1353,budgets it's not an easy decision no,ep085
1356,[Music],ep085
1359,even though it's the most expensive I,ep085
1362,think definitely the ranch home I would,ep085
1365,feel the most comfortable in that home I,ep085
1368,want you guys to be somewhere where you,ep085
1371,feel safe and you're close to anything,ep085
1374,that you need,ep085
1377,so did we make a decision are we gonna,ep085
1380,go with the ranch yes honey,ep085
1383,there we go we did it,ep085
1386,we bought our house yes we did it's done,ep085
1389,I absolutely love this house,ep085
1392,the house was listed for nine hundred,ep085
1395,and twenty nine thousand but with the,ep085
1398,lanes help we were able to purchase it,ep085
1401,for eight hundred fifty thousand eight,ep085
1404,hundred fifty thousand is a significant,ep085
1407,amount over but you know it's seen how,ep085
1410,happy my family is I think I can get,ep085
1413,over that I didn't exactly get the,ep085
1416,wet-dry kitchen that I saw in Asia,ep085
1419,however with the two separate spaces,ep085
1422,that it does have I'm definitely not,ep085
1425,planning to do any kind of renovation,ep085
1428,one of the compromises I had to make was,ep085
1431,two of the four bedrooms in this house,ep085
1434,are in the basement which means my,ep085
1437,daughter's in the basement which really,ep085
1440,was not ideal which she loves this face,ep085
1443,she's made it her own we got the keys to,ep085
1446,this house exactly one month ago we are,ep085
1449,moved in and the kids are in school it's,ep085
1452,been awesome getting out of the hotel,ep085
1455,room although it was great family,ep085
1458,bonding time in the hotel what I found,ep085
1461,is that in the basement I've been able,ep085
1464,to convert one of those rooms into my,ep085
1467,office now I actually have a room where,ep085
1470,I can close the door and be able to do,ep085
1473,conference calls because we move so,ep085
1476,often it's kind of difficult to make a,ep085
1479,place feel like home but for us every,ep085
1482,time we move we feel like this could be,ep085
1485,our last and this is most definitely,ep085
1488,home,ep085
12,you want to try driving the boat fill,ep086
15,Megan and their little boy Mitch are,ep086
18,trading the suburbs of New Jersey for,ep086
21,the beach paradise of Belize we have,ep086
24,been planning and saving for this for a,ep086
27,decade at least and we also sold off all,ep086
30,of our possessions so we're all in with,ep086
33,police megan can't wait to buy their,ep086
36,dream house oh wow this is huge but bill,ep086
39,might be too cautious to make their,ep086
42,dream come true to get what you want,ep086
45,we're gonna have to I'm just showing it,ep086
48,to you okay I love the location you say,ep086
51,location I see street noise we didn't,ep086
54,come here to play it safe Phil we don't,ep086
57,have jobs I'm just hesitant to throw all,ep086
60,our money into one property we need to,ep086
63,go big or go home,ep086
66,[Music],ep086
69,we're here about are you working I was,ep086
72,in college in Philadelphia and I met,ep086
75,Phil we got big suitcases we started,ep086
78,dating that summer can you get that one,ep086
81,for me and we've been married now about,ep086
84,seven years hello how are you we always,ep086
87,wanted to move abroad and we started,ep086
90,traveling and researching places and one,ep086
93,of the places that we visited was,ep086
96,placencia we definitely want to check,ep086
99,out the area there local restaurants we,ep086
102,kept coming back to it because we liked,ep086
105,the vibe and we liked the expat,ep086
108,community here we definitely want to,ep086
111,live more simply I don't want Mitch just,ep086
114,in front of a screen all the time,ep086
117,more the life that we had when we were,ep086
120,children it's the perfect time Mitch is,ep086
123,still young and he'll adapt really well,ep086
126,it dumps out perfect we're both leaving,ep086
129,careers and coming down here without any,ep086
132,employment line Bob good welcome to,ep086
135,believe absolutely the biggest challenge,ep086
138,is finding a way to generate enough,ep086
141,income to continue to stay here essentia,ep086
144,beliefs is a 17 mile peninsula the,ep086
147,Caribbean ocean on one side the lagoon,ep086
150,on the other side it started out as a,ep086
153,fishing village but has now been,ep086
156,converted more to tourism because of the,ep086
159,nice beaches that we have we have,ep086
162,fishing scuba diving the streets are,ep086
165,kind of paved but not it doesn't feel,ep086
168,like a tourist destination and it's just,ep086
171,super friendly in recent years plus NC,ep086
174,it's really boomed and it's become even,ep086
177,more of a tourist destination so that's,ep086
180,why we want to try to find rental,ep086
183,properties or a property that's,ep086
186,relatively cheap that'll allow us to,ep086
189,film and get some income that way,ep086
192,ideally we want a property with an,ep086
195,existing business or rental units that,ep086
198,we could live on-site and make a little,ep086
201,bit of money with the property it has to,ep086
204,be in the village or really close five,ep086
207,ideally probably three or four bedrooms,ep086
210,so if I found like a single family with,ep086
213,room to,ep086
216,build a few cabanas with that work that,ep086
219,definitely could work depending on where,ep086
222,it falls in our budget ok and what,ep086
225,budget are you in well our budget is,ep086
228,what about three hundred thousand really,ep086
231,don't want to go much higher than that,ep086
234,okay my biggest challenge is the,ep086
237,property it's not out there so we either,ep086
240,have to go smaller or away from the,ep086
243,village or go a little over budget my,ep086
246,strategy for picking this house just,ep086
249,outside the village a little bit almost,ep086
252,a waterview in every room got the three,ep086
255,rental units and has plenty of space,ep086
258,that they can add to they did a really,ep086
261,nice job with landscaping two buildings,ep086
264,okay it's a four-bedroom three-bathroom,ep086
267,and there's plenty of room to add more,ep086
270,cabanas for more rental income so how,ep086
273,much is it it's 350 yikes that's over,ep086
276,budget,ep086
279,yikes yeah to get what you want we're,ep086
282,gonna have to I'm just showing it to you,ep086
285,okay you know I'm excited for you to see,ep086
288,it why don't we go in and just take a,ep086
291,look at it and see all the positives I,ep086
294,have an issue with the price three,ep086
297,hundred fifty thousand is just too far,ep086
300,over our budget and I'm not really,ep086
303,willing to go there this is a two,ep086
306,bedroom very modern finishes oh yeah,ep086
309,very modern take a look at the bedroom,ep086
312,oh yeah this is a good sized bedroom too,ep086
315,a little small but yeah very nice so,ep086
318,this would be more for you know rentals,ep086
321,guests they have gas stove decent-sized,ep086
324,fridge yes this is so cute Meghan I,ep086
327,disagree on the fact that she feels this,ep086
330,house is perfect for us and I just think,ep086
333,this house is way too much price and,ep086
336,this property is fair for what you get,ep086
339,check out the view that's amazing it,ep086
342,doesn't get no prettier than this great,ep086
345,breeze up here this is the main owners,ep086
348,living room Wow again like so,ep086
351,cool and modern the bedroom this is the,ep086
354,master nice,ep086
357,is there a second bedroom there's not,ep086
360,but it can be added yeah so behind this,ep086
363,is what I call a breakfast nook this is,ep086
366,so cute this could even be closed in for,ep086
369,a bedroom,ep086
372,the upstairs without a legitimate full,ep086
375,second bedroom for Mitch I'm not sure,ep086
378,that's something you know we're gonna be,ep086
381,able to fix sunsets are all out here,ep086
384,than the kitchen it's got everything you,ep086
387,need,ep086
390,and then the next studio cabana I love,ep086
393,that it's a three Plex so there's the,ep086
396,rental potential we have the screen,ep086
399,porch beautiful views again right yeah,ep086
402,so this is a studio Cabana oh wow it's,ep086
405,really nice yeah full kitchen it's teeny,ep086
408,but it's got everything you need the,ep086
411,bathroom in bedrooms back here that's a,ep086
414,very nice bathroom it's great for a,ep086
417,rental yeah overall I really like it I,ep086
420,love all the cute quirky details the,ep086
423,ceilings I love the huge fenced in yard,ep086
426,I think Mitch would be really happy out,ep086
429,here and I think like the rentals could,ep086
432,be a good business for us and I could,ep086
435,see living here I'll give you all that,ep086
438,but you know the price point you're,ep086
441,"350,000 that's way over our budget and",ep086
444,we're still talking no second bedroom,ep086
447,for Mitch so if we try to address those,ep086
450,things you know our costs are even,ep086
453,higher do you have a single-family home,ep086
456,that we could look at me that's under,ep086
459,our budget next Dave makes Phil happy,ep086
462,with a house that's way under budget,ep086
465,this one is 160 ah I like it good job,ep086
468,David,ep086
471,Megan wishes it was closer to town,ep086
474,I hate the location as property but she,ep086
477,has to admit I didn't want to like this,ep086
480,house as much as I liked it no board,ep086
483,it's gonna be really nice to be with,ep086
486,Mitch a lot more,ep086
489,he wasn't try driving the boat he's,ep086
492,going to learn how to fish with the,ep086
495,other kids in the village and he's gonna,ep086
498,learn how to climb coconut trees yeah,ep086
501,buddy you want to go in the water too we,ep086
504,want a different lifestyle for us for,ep086
507,Mitch we definitely want to spend more,ep086
510,time outside and live more simply you're,ep086
513,right on the water,ep086
516,not having him worry about whether he,ep086
519,has the the latest sneakers the newest,ep086
522,clothes or the newest video game Mitch,ep086
525,can grow up here have a lot of close,ep086
528,friends okay well since he is so,ep086
531,different than the lifestyle that were,ep086
534,used to more relaxed and laid-back no,ep086
537,one is keeping up with the Joneses but,ep086
540,changing everything comes at a price,ep086
543,Phil's apprehensive about this move he,ep086
546,would have liked to stay and save a,ep086
549,couple more years she doesn't grasp the,ep086
552,consequences of what exceeding the,ep086
555,budget would do work down here without,ep086
558,any jobs and our plan B is moving back,ep086
561,to New Jersey the first place has,ep086
564,ridiculous views that's amazing it,ep086
567,doesn't get no prettier than this and,ep086
570,Macon fell in love with it I loved all,ep086
573,the cute quirky details I think Mitch,ep086
576,would be really happy out here but not,ep086
579,if Mitch wants his own bedroom is there,ep086
582,a second bedroom there's not no this,ep086
585,property was over our budget I want to,ep086
588,go in the other direction I love that,ep086
591,it's a three Plex again so there's the,ep086
594,income-generating rental potential bill,ep086
597,and Meghan are just not quite in sync,ep086
600,with what they want,ep086
603,my strategy is this show fill with,ep086
606,single family well under budget and Maya,ep086
609,Beach yeah it's a real safe neighborhood,ep086
612,we're in the Maya Beach subdivision it's,ep086
615,lovely up here but like that was a far,ep086
618,Drive it we stopped with the bumps and,ep086
621,all that the speed bumps but it's really,ep086
624,ten minutes from the village 15 minutes,ep086
627,from the village okay that's too bad no,ep086
630,no you got a lot of car right right it's,ep086
633,a two-bedroom one-bathroom and it's on a,ep086
636,canal so the canal will wrap around and,ep086
639,lead you to the ocean by boat very nice,ep086
642,this is a single-family home this isn't,ep086
645,rental property right okay there's a,ep086
648,single-family home how much is this one,ep086
651,this one for you Phil there's 160 ah I,ep086
654,like it good job David so you want to go,ep086
657,see it sure all right let's go in very,ep086
660,nice nice swinging yeah I like the,ep086
663,hammocks the living room is here,ep086
666,mahogany very nice nice hardwood floors,ep086
669,yeah yeah that's a nice space it is,ep086
672,little kitchen sitting area yeah let's,ep086
675,look at the kitchen,ep086
678,mahogany it's small but it's got,ep086
681,everything you need it's got a decent,ep086
684,amount of counter space yeah there's,ep086
687,plenty of room in here,ep086
690,then eating okay looks out onto the,ep086
693,property yeah in bathroom oh that's so,ep086
696,this is the wood I considered the master,ep086
699,bedroom it's nice,ep086
702,Mitch's room right next door oh it's a,ep086
705,good size kid's bedroom,ep086
708,absolutely I'm loving the ceilings,ep086
711,throughout this house yes ceilings are,ep086
714,very nice I didn't want to like this,ep086
717,house as much as I like it because it's,ep086
720,not in the village I hate,ep086
723,that I love this property it was really,ep086
726,cute it had a really nice bedroom for,ep086
729,Mitch but I hate the location I want to,ep086
732,be in the village I don't want to feel,ep086
735,secluded I love this property so far,ep086
738,under budget it gives us a ton of,ep086
741,options I think this could work so lush,ep086
744,here and the Lots pretty big the boat,ep086
747,slip does come with it so this is part,ep086
750,of the property very nice I didn't want,ep086
753,to get a car or golf cart but maybe we,ep086
756,could get a boat it's possible it's,ep086
759,under budget we can do anything and then,ep086
762,over here in front of the boat slip we,ep086
765,could even add a cabana or something for,ep086
768,some rental income there's definitely,ep086
771,space yeah clothes in the house it's a,ep086
774,good size lot it's beautiful ceilings,ep086
777,throughout there's good space for Mitch,ep086
780,I love being on the canal back here but,ep086
783,it doesn't have any units to rent you,ep086
786,know there's no income generating,ep086
789,potential here I mean unless we're gonna,ep086
792,put a lot of time and money and work,ep086
795,into in closing the bottom or building a,ep086
798,Cabana so I just I don't think you're,ep086
801,looking at the whole picture and I think,ep086
804,we're so far under budget got some,ep086
807,wiggle room to play with I think we,ep086
810,could make it work,ep086
813,next Dave brings them back into the,ep086
816,village this has two rental incomes but,ep086
819,Phil hates the price 325 thanks,ep086
822,are you nervous just a little bit Phil,ep086
825,Megan and their little boy Mitch are,ep086
828,trading suburban New Jersey for the,ep086
831,beach oasis of placencia please see how,ep086
834,high we get up but with no jobs and no,ep086
837,income they're worried about how to make,ep086
840,their dream a reality,ep086
843,might be coming down here maybe a year,ep086
846,too too early and I'd like to have saved,ep086
849,a little more money before coming down,ep086
852,here there wasn't ever gonna be a,ep086
855,perfect time for Phil and we would have,ep086
858,been 68 I had to kind of push him to,ep086
861,make the leap I'm impulsive and Phil is,ep086
864,mr. Jackson figures Megan wants to go,ep086
867,for broke and find a large house with,ep086
870,rental potential while Phil is scared of,ep086
873,blowing all their savings right off the,ep086
876,bat she doesn't really grasp the,ep086
879,consequences of exceeding the budget our,ep086
882,goal is really just to try to find a way,ep086
885,you know Mitch can grow up here if we,ep086
888,can't find a property that really works,ep086
891,for us we might not be able to stay here,ep086
894,the first place has amazing views you,ep086
897,know that's amazing,ep086
900,doesn't get no prettier than this I love,ep086
903,all the cute quirky details the ceilings,ep086
906,I love the huge fenced in yard I think,ep086
909,Mitch would be really happy out here but,ep086
912,Mitch won't have his own bedroom is,ep086
915,there a second bedroom there's not know,ep086
918,the Maya beach house is way under budget,ep086
921,this one is 160 ah I like it yeah good,ep086
924,job David but that was a far Drive it's,ep086
927,10 minutes from the village quite a car,ep086
930,right right I don't want to feel,ep086
933,secluded I chose this house because,ep086
936,Megan wanted to be in the village and,ep086
939,this has two rental income so they can,ep086
942,live in wine yeah so got the grocery,ep086
945,store right here restaurant across the,ep086
948,street lagoon right there it's right in,ep086
951,the middle of everything in the village,ep086
954,top floor 2-bedroom 1-bath middle floor,ep086
957,2-bedroom 1-bath downstairs is a studio,ep086
960,with a bath three kitchens three,ep086
963,bathrooms five bedrooms it's 325 Thanks,ep086
966,it's a little over budget but why don't,ep086
969,we just go look at it and see yeah okay,ep086
972,the property does come fully furnished,ep086
975,the owners done a lot of work to it it's,ep086
978,a good size for two people it'd be,ep086
981,perfect for renters coming to stay on,ep086
984,vacation let's go to the second floor,ep086
987,recently been painted on large balcony,ep086
990,okay this is nice,ep086
993,check out this kitchen oh wow this is,ep086
996,huge,ep086
999,that is big it will make a great rental,ep086
1002,they're spacious the kitchens are huge,ep086
1005,it's just a very big house it might be a,ep086
1008,bigger investment than I'm willing to do,ep086
1011,right now one of the bedrooms is right,ep086
1014,here okay,ep086
1017,24 different hardwoods here and as I,ep086
1020,mentioned downstairs all the furniture,ep086

1026,yeah guys here's a second bedroom,ep086
1029,decent size oh yeah that's a good size,ep086
1032,goes to a patio outside so a lot of,ep086
1035,outdoor space right around the bedroom,ep086
1038,let's see the third floor it's nice,ep086
1041,right yeah the house has a lot of decks,ep086
1044,but there's not a ton of yard so Mitch,ep086
1047,doesn't have a lot of places to play,ep086
1050,outside check out the kitchen,ep086
1053,Wow another huge kitchen six burner,ep086
1056,stove Haga new cabinets this is your,ep086

1065,for you all to live here then rent the,ep086
1068,two bottom floors out I do hear some,ep086
1071,noise outside you are in the village so,ep086
1074,we're gonna have some noise being right,ep086
1077,on the street could be dangerous for,ep086
1080,Mitch there are a lot of cars going past,ep086
1083,it could be a recipe for disaster,ep086
1086,Phil might be trying to recreate what we,ep086
1089,had back in the States as far as quiet,ep086
1092,and a big yard and that's not really,ep086
1095,what village life is about and we're,ep086
1098,looking to change our way of life this,ep086
1101,is the master bedroom on the third floor,ep086
1104,yeah yeah but I really like these,ep086
1107,that's cool the neat feature right it's,ep086
1110,so cool,ep086
1113,another large deck take a look you're,ep086
1116,kind of in the trees it has a lot of,ep086
1119,space,ep086
1122,I like the income potential of it it's a,ep086
1125,lot of house I love the location it's,ep086
1128,perfect for me right now village yes I,ep086
1131,mean you say location but I see street,ep086
1134,noise you know 50 feet away it's well,ep086
1137,over budget we probably have to go a,ep086
1140,little bit smaller it's not that much,ep086
1143,over budget it's got the character I won,ep086
1146,an income potential and I really like,ep086
1149,the location it's right here in the,ep086
1152,thick of things it is all right we'll,ep086
1155,see,ep086
1158,[Music],ep086
1161,you're not thinking long game here we,ep086
1164,don't have jobs I'm just hesitant to,ep086
1167,throw all our money into one property we,ep086
1170,didn't come here to play it safe Phil,ep086
1173,all right let's go buddy Phil Meghan and,ep086
1176,their son Mitch have sold everything and,ep086
1179,are moving from Lynwood New Jersey to,ep086
1182,the coastal village of placencia Belize,ep086
1185,we sold all of our assets so you know,ep086
1188,we're all in with police phil is worried,ep086
1191,about spending all of their nest egg I'd,ep086
1194,rather spend less and I'm seed money,ep086
1197,might be something that would be helpful,ep086
1200,well Meghan wants to seize the day we,ep086
1203,need to go big or go home I'm worried,ep086
1206,that begging can be a bit of a dreamer,ep086
1209,and we had the crocodile Creek cabanas,ep086
1212,checked out the view it doesn't get no,ep086
1215,prettier than this I love all the cute,ep086
1218,quirky details and the rentals could be,ep086
1221,a good business for us I could see us,ep086
1224,living here by price point that's way,ep086
1227,over our budget and we're still talking,ep086
1230,no second bedroom for Mitch so if we try,ep086
1233,to impress those things now our costs,ep086
1236,are even higher and then we had the Maya,ep086
1239,beach house Wow very nice yeah I didn't,ep086
1242,want to like this house as much as I,ep086
1245,liked it because it's not in the village,ep086
1248,but it doesn't have any units to rent,ep086
1251,you know there's no income generating,ep086
1254,potential here unless we're gonna put a,ep086
1257,lot of time and money and work into in,ep086
1260,closing the bottom or building a cabana,ep086
1263,and I think we're so far under budget,ep086
1266,got some wiggle room to play with,ep086
1269,driffold Gardens is huge,ep086
1272,that is big it will make a great rental,ep086
1275,and walking into the other floors and I,ep086
1278,think that their spacious the kitchens,ep086
1281,are huge,ep086
1284,all the furniture comes with the,ep086
1287,property and this would be perfect for,ep086
1290,you all to live here and rent the two,ep086
1293,bottom floors out I do hear some noise,ep086
1296,outside you are in the village could be,ep086
1299,dangerous for Mitch there are a lot of,ep086
1302,cars going past you could be a recipe,ep086
1305,for disaster so we're over budget but,ep086
1308,not by much,ep086
1311,I love the location I mean you say,ep086
1314,location but I see street noise,ep086
1317,the crocodile Creek cabanas it was just,ep086
1320,so far over budget and it was a big,ep086
1323,problem 18 alrightso crocodile Creek is,ep086
1326,gone,ep086
1329,that leaves us drift with Gardens and,ep086
1332,the Mighty Beanz house I know you love,ep086
1335,"the price tag on Maya Beach $160,000",ep086
1338,gives us lots of extra money to figure,ep086
1341,things out it was a really nice house if,ep086
1344,it were in the village and it had a,ep086
1347,rental property under it we should go,ep086
1350,with driftwood Gardens it's huge,ep086
1353,and it's right in the village it's got,ep086
1356,great income potential don't twenty five,ep086
1359,thousand over our budget,ep086
1362,but you heard how the way see that,ep086
1365,string was but we could start making,ep086
1368,money right away with the maya beach,ep086
1371,house we're so far under budget we could,ep086
1374,buy this house have a place for us to,ep086
1377,live and then we have all this extra,ep086
1380,money you know to potentially start a,ep086
1383,business buy another property at all,ep086
1386,cabanas to that property,ep086
1389,you're not thinking long game here we,ep086
1392,don't have jobs I'm just hesitant to,ep086
1395,throw all our money into one property we,ep086
1398,didn't come here to play it safe Phil,ep086
1401,it's not time to pinch pennies you got a,ep086
1404,go-for-broke and like we got to make,ep086
1407,this happen all right I see your point,ep086
1410,you're you're making a making a lot of,ep086
1413,good points I I think we probably could,ep086
1416,make some money with this you'd be happy,ep086
1419,there that's the direction you should go,ep086
1422,well I'm really glad you came around to,ep086

1479,to be able to live simply enjoy,ep086
1482,ourselves and this to see us to do that,ep086

30,island his girlfriend Heather is also,ep087
33,his agent and knows the perfect home for,ep087
36,fall will be hard to find it is four,ep087
39,hundred and twenty five thousand dollar,ep087
42,budget so you've got your chef's kitchen,ep087
45,I wouldn't call it a chef's kitchen,ep087
48,really these trees are beautiful and,ep087
51,they also drop leaves that I have to,ep087
54,wake up and since she's moving into the,ep087
57,home too,ep087
60,she also has her own list of wonts,ep087
63,there's only one sink here that doesn't,ep087
66,make much sense as plenty of space for,ep087
69,two these stairs are just as you walk in,ep087
72,and there's a lot of them will they find,ep087
75,a home that makes them both happy I like,ep087
78,the look of the countertops but they're,ep087
81,not granite they're not are they yeah,ep087
84,you're gonna have to just replace all,ep087
87,the appliances in here I don't want to,ep087
90,[Music],ep087
93,this is fresh from the from our tower,ep087
96,garden yeah I grew this my name is Paul,ep087
99,I'm a certified registered nurse,ep087
102,anesthetist we were in the ER and got an,ep087

126,real estate agent this is south lagoon,ep087
129,area I and then they are also wanting to,ep087
132,look at The Cove area which are two,ep087
135,great choices we met in 2010 we hit it,ep087
138,off from the start I gave you my number,ep087
141,and I waited four days before calling,ep087
144,her and it drove over a while crazy what,ep087
147,I call her I knew I was going to it was,ep087
150,my plan both Paul and Heather have lived,ep087
153,in Panama City Florida for several years,ep087
156,Panama City is beautiful,ep087
159,the beaches are so close your feet,ep087
162,squeak and the white puffy sand and the,ep087
165,color of the turquoise water beautiful,ep087
168,sunset night the reason why we're buying,ep087
171,this house now I've been here since 2004,ep087
174,I think I need to be on the water now,ep087
177,that they're moving in together,ep087
180,they'll need enough space for his two,ep087
183,children and her two children from a,ep087
186,previous relationship ultimately if his,ep087
189,decision but I have an opinion how about,ep087
192,I don't like the yellow door not really,ep087
195,until you wanted unique I like the,ep087
198,Craftsman style house it's unique the,ep087
201,Builder can put his artistry into it,ep087
204,look at the stone work around that nice,ep087
207,dent in the hardwood floors yeah very,ep087
210,nice definitely want those hardwood,ep087
213,floors but I'm gonna be looking more on,ep087
216,the water so I may not be able to get,ep087
219,that I like the granite and look the,ep087
222,pendants over the pendant lights over,ep087
225,the countertop if there's one of the,ep087
228,independence I like a hearty ranch-style,ep087
231,no two stories I,ep087
234,house to be wide open and airy I would,ep087
237,love an open concept to Paul also wants,ep087
240,at least three bedrooms and two,ep087
243,bathrooms as well as crown molding and,ep087
246,since he's a chef the kitchen is a top,ep087
249,priority I love my chef's kitchen a,ep087
252,chef's kitchen is a functional kitchen,ep087
255,an island stainless steel appliances I,ep087
258,would like some granite countertops I,ep087
261,want the kitchen to be pretty the,ep087
264,function is not as important for me but,ep087
267,it's now looking I want a good backyard,ep087
270,for outdoor living a big yard means more,ep087
273,work for me I would like a smaller yard,ep087
276,and not too many trees outdoor cooking,ep087
279,space is a must I love a good front,ep087
282,porch for a southern home I don't know,ep087
285,if they can find a wraparound and yes I,ep087
288,may live in Florida but I want a,ep087
291,fireplace and a real wood-burning,ep087
294,fireplace a pool would be great but it's,ep087
297,not a deal-breaker if I don't have a,ep087
300,pool that looks good,ep087
303,I don't see the water though looking for,ep087
306,some water waterfront is very important,ep087
309,to me I don't have a boat right now but,ep087
312,I am going to get one it's a,ep087
315,deal-breaker for me if I find a house,ep087
318,that does not have a boat dock my budget,ep087
321,is four hundred thousand,ep087
324,I'd be willing to spend four hundred and,ep087
327,twenty five thousand that's the realtor,ep087
330,I'll have to let him know but we can't,ep087
333,always find exactly what he wants he may,ep087
336,have to compromise because within your,ep087
339,budget,ep087
342,you may not get your chef's kitchen and,ep087
345,grandeur you may have to do some,ep087
348,settling,ep087
351,first up a ranch-style home right on a,ep087
354,canal I noticed right away that it's not,ep087
357,a craftsman-style house no it's a,ep087
360,full-on ranch Paul's going to have to,ep087
363,compromise on his desire of a craftsman,ep087
366,there are not many craftsmen here in,ep087
369,Florida but we can find some charm and,ep087
372,some small details that might be inside,ep087
375,a home it is a three bed two and a half,ep087
378,"bath 2,500 square feet and best of all",ep087
381,"it's under budget at $350,000",ep087
384,I like that okay I also noticed this,ep087
387,Craftsman style door looks really nice,ep087
390,yeah it's unique I notice right away the,ep087
393,gigantic place is your fireplace looks,ep087
396,like a wood-burning fireplace - yes,ep087
399,it'll be perfect at Christmastime yeah I,ep087
402,also noticed that there's no hardwood,ep087
405,floors yeah but this is actually very,ep087
408,nice tile and think Florida living on,ep087
411,the water tile might be more beneficial,ep087
414,mmm cool speaking of on the water you,ep087
417,can see right through the whole house,ep087
420,and there's the right canal yeah very,ep087
423,nice check out this wide-open kitchen,ep087
426,wow that's pretty nice house stainless,ep087
429,steel appliances yeah except for this,ep087
432,stove in the microwave I've got plenty,ep087
435,of cabinet space right lots of cabinet,ep087
438,space for all my trinkets and this,ep087
441,island is huge which is very nice it is,ep087
444,I like the look of the countertops but,ep087
447,they're not granite they're not are they,ep087
450,the kitchen is very spacious it's got,ep087
453,nice lighting it's got a huge island,ep087
456,which I like there's another fireplace,ep087
459,in this living room I know you're,ep087
462,excited well some built-ins here too and,ep087
465,I noticed right away that the ceilings,ep087
468,appear to be higher which I like I like,ep087
471,that open space feeling yeah but it's,ep087
474,just because we walked down a couple of,ep087
477,stairs yeah and I don't like stairs but,ep087
480,I guess three will be okay you'll,ep087
483,tolerate three stairs okay okay so,ep087
486,bedrooms back here as well as the,ep087
489,laundry okay they see two guest bedrooms,ep087
492,and a guest bath before seeing the,ep087
495,master okay so here's the master and,ep087
498,check out you've got double doors right,ep087
501,here leading right out to the back I,ep087
504,like the French doors yeah nice got your,ep087
507,crown cut the crown molding okay I wish,ep087
510,it was a little bit bigger but yeah,ep087
513,let's see the bathroom there's only one,ep087
516,sink here that doesn't make much sense,ep087
519,as plenty of space for two yeah I wish,ep087
522,that we've been there shower toilet you,ep087
525,know it's kind of disappointing the,ep087
528,guest bath is better than the master,ep087
531,bathroom it's true all right so let's go,ep087
534,see you outside okay your outdoor living,ep087
537,space oh wow look at the canal and the,ep087
540,boathouse,ep087
543,yeah that's there for you you've got a,ep087
546,screened-in porch and a hot tub maybe,ep087
549,out here put in your grill for your,ep087
552,outdoor cooking space well we could the,ep087
555,problem is these boards look kind of,ep087
558,rotten actually yeah but your waterfront,ep087
561,and it's 350 thousand true you've got a,ep087
564,huge double lot on the corner with 300,ep087
567,plus feet of waterfront look at all this,ep087
570,yard I didn't want too much of a yard to,ep087
573,maintain yeah but these trees are,ep087
576,beautiful and they also drop leaves that,ep087
579,I have to rake up the number-one,ep087
582,priority in this house hunt was the,ep087
585,outdoor living space and I thought it,ep087
588,was exactly what he was looking for I,ep087
591,have to keep him grounded and realistic,ep087
594,[Music],ep087
597,so tell me some pots that kitchen isn't,ep087
600,so bad I love the islands got a lot of,ep087
603,cabinet space which I really need and it,ep087
606,had to a wood-burning fireplaces that,ep087
609,you love but this yard is so big is,ep087
612,gonna be so much to maintain as your,ep087
615,girlfriend I don't like that master,ep087
618,suite but as your Realtor I had to show,ep087
621,it to you because it's a great bargain,ep087
624,and under budget,ep087
627,though heather has a house with a more,ep087
630,manageable yard for Paul but there's a,ep087
633,catch it's a little above budget at,ep087
636,"450,000",ep087
639,450 is a little bit much for me,ep087
642,[Music],ep087
645,sunset dinner on the beach this is life,ep087
648,Oh with the help of his agent and,ep087
651,girlfriend Heather is determined to find,ep087
654,a home in Panama City Florida where they,ep087
657,can both be happy they hope to find a,ep087
660,waterfront home with a chef's kitchen,ep087
663,and enough space for their blended,ep087
666,family a tough ask within Paul's four,ep087
669,hundred and twenty five thousand dollar,ep087
672,budget finding the true Craftsman style,ep087
675,home that Paul wants has also proven,ep087
678,difficult so far they saw a ranch-style,ep087
681,home on the water,ep087
684,with a large kitchen and some of the,ep087
687,craftsman character Paul wants but the,ep087
690,master suite left a lot to be desired,ep087
693,and the yard would require a lot of,ep087
696,maintenance so now Heather is found a,ep087
699,contemporary style home with an outdoor,ep087
702,space that's sure to impress Paul I love,ep087
705,the sound of the wind through the pines,ep087
708,its very nature s yes there's a,ep087
711,wraparound porch that you like yeah I,ep087
714,got a concrete but it's still a,ep087
717,wraparound I'm very excited about that,ep087
720,"so this one is a 3-bed 2bath 2,000",ep087
723,square feet but it's a little above,ep087
726,"budget 450,000 it's slightly above",ep087
729,budget which I'm not too happy about or,ep087
732,50s a little bit much for me okay so I,ep087
735,noticed right away that these stairs so,ep087
738,just as you walk in there's a lot of,ep087
741,them yes well there's cathedral ceilings,ep087
744,it feels very open in here yeah that's,ep087
747,true and you've got your hardwood floors,ep087
750,I think they're laminate but maybe it's,ep087
753,hardwood yeah I noticed that they,ep087
756,optimized this view with all these,ep087
759,windows absolutely a hundred and eighty,ep087
762,degrees worth of waterfront right here,ep087
765,Wow I feel like I'm on my own little,ep087
768,island I really love walking in the door,ep087
771,and seeing the dock from the door the,ep087
774,view is spectacular they have a,ep087
777,fireplace,ep087
780,- it's not wood-burning but at least,ep087
783,there is one yes why don't we go outside,ep087
786,and check out the view it's why we're,ep087
789,here,ep087
792,[Applause],ep087
795,now that's what I'm talking about oh I,ep087
798,love it,ep087
801,I could see grilling right over here I,ep087
804,could see a boat out on the dock over,ep087
807,there yeah there's a hundred and fifty,ep087
810,five feet of waterfront here awesome oh,ep087
813,and I can shower right here,ep087
816,Oh the neighbors will appreciate that,ep087
819,back inside they see the kitchen there's,ep087
822,no island here for you no island no,ep087
825,stainless steel not exactly a chef's,ep087
828,kitchen there's a good amount of cabinet,ep087
831,space though a lot of for all my little,ep087
834,trinkets you've got countertops look,ep087
837,nice but they're not granite also the,ep087
840,stove top is an electric stovetop,ep087
843,I really prefer induction or gas yeah,ep087
846,you're gonna have to just replace all,ep087
849,the appliances I'm here I don't want to,ep087
852,and here is your master bedroom room is,ep087
855,pretty big yeah well I do like to tray,ep087
858,ceilings that's Craftsman style ish got,ep087
861,your master bath right over there they,ep087
864,really love their white and thing,ep087
867,his-and-her sinks yeah I do like the big,ep087
870,tub there to be nice yeah they see the,ep087
873,walk-in closet and laundry room on the,ep087
876,way to a guest bedroom so we've got,ep087
879,bedroom number two or three,ep087
882,it's a decent size room I like the,ep087
885,sliding glass door that opens up to the,ep087
888,patio out there yeah and guess ah okay,ep087
891,and let's head up and see the third,ep087
894,bedroom,ep087
897,lots of stairs mm-hmm but up here you've,ep087
900,got your third bedroom yeah it feels,ep087
903,more like a loft to me just because,ep087
906,there's no door and the section missing,ep087
909,out of the wall it is an open concept,ep087
912,isn't it it's very open the closets make,ep087
915,this a third bedroom oh okay still kind,ep087
918,of strange in my opinion a bedroom has,ep087
921,doors and you're supposed to have some,ep087
924,privacy there it's essentially a lot,ep087
927,overall what are you thinking overall I,ep087
930,love the view I love being on the water,ep087
933,I love that deck that's beautiful yeah,ep087
936,I'm not crazy about the kitchen I don't,ep087
939,like how you open the door and there the,ep087
942,stairs but I like out my fireplace you,ep087
945,got your fire okay that's your open,ep087
948,concept it's very nice that way this,ep087
951,house only has two bedrooms and a loft,ep087
954,the loft is a big - I thought it was,ep087
957,three bedrooms you can really,ep087
960,accommodate all the kids here though,ep087
963,Heather finds a home that has more room,ep087
966,for the kids but do you think about the,ep087
969,house kind of disappointed that it's not,ep087
972,a craftsman-style house,ep087
975,[Music],ep087
978,love this speech Paul has a maximum,ep087
981,budget of 425 thousand dollars to find a,ep087
984,home with waterfront access for himself,ep087
987,and his girlfriend / agent Heather in,ep087
990,Panama City Florida so far they've seen,ep087
993,a house with great indoor space but an,ep087
996,outdoor area that fell short and another,ep087
999,with great outdoor amenities but the,ep087
1002,layout didn't work for their blended,ep087
1005,family we have here the four-bed,ep087
1008,"three-bath 2,100 square feet and there's",ep087
1011,plenty of room for the kids what do you,ep087
1014,think about the house kind of,ep087
1017,disappointed it's not a craftsman-style,ep087
1020,house like I really wanted I know Paul,ep087
1023,would love to find a craftsman but he,ep087
1026,may just have to settle for a few,ep087
1029,craftsman details and I'm gonna rule,ep087
1032,this point in because there's no,ep087
1035,wraparound porch and I just wanted to,ep087
1038,let you know it's 425 all right I do,ep087
1041,like the Craftsman style door hardwood,ep087
1044,door like that but it has stairs and I,ep087
1047,wasn't looking for that oh you like the,ep087
1050,stairs yeah and I wanted hardwood floors,ep087
1053,would have been ideal for me I mean this,ep087
1056,tile looks actually pretty nice but my,ep087
1059,preference is hardwood flooring it's got,ep087
1062,an interesting design so you've got a,ep087
1065,living room this is actually quite a big,ep087
1068,room when I soap in windows to the,ep087
1071,outside I like that mm-hmm,ep087
1074,there's no crown molding here yeah the,ep087
1077,crown molding to me adds to the charm of,ep087
1080,the house it's got a classic look okay,ep087
1083,looks like we've got our dining room,ep087
1086,right over here it almost looks like,ep087
1089,they wanted to open it but yet not open,ep087
1092,it with these there was definitely an,ep087
1095,attempt to update it what's the,ep087
1098,dining-room lamp Hey,ep087
1101,it's dangling almost all the way to the,ep087
1104,floor well come on in here so you've got,ep087
1107,your chef's kitchen I wouldn't call it a,ep087
1110,chef's kitchen really you've got your,ep087
1113,stainless-steel appliances here I have,ep087
1116,pots that are higher than this,ep087
1119,there's a nice island here and there's,ep087
1122,granite countertop this could be the,ep087
1125,family room look the fireplace it feels,ep087
1128,a little tight in here though just,ep087
1131,because this there's that second-story,ep087
1134,but this this is why I brought you so,ep087
1137,why don't we check it out okay here,ep087
1140,you've got a screen porch for this great,ep087
1143,Florida living oh yes this is nice but I,ep087
1146,want to go out there and check out the,ep087
1149,rest of the yard oh wow look at the pool,ep087
1152,this is Florida right here I love it,ep087
1155,yeah in a nice little space right here,ep087
1158,where I could do some grilling okay I,ep087
1161,want to check out the dock to look at,ep087
1164,that canal that's a lot of space right,ep087
1167,on the water you have a hundred and,ep087
1170,twenty-five feet waterfront,ep087
1173,I see why is 425 now the view alone is,ep087
1176,worth 40 points absolutely they head,ep087
1179,back inside to see a guest bedroom then,ep087
1182,go upstairs to see two more guest,ep087
1185,bedrooms and a guest bathroom oh this is,ep087
1188,a really nice bathroom this kind of,ep087
1191,reminds me of the Craftsman style that I,ep087
1194,wanted oh yeah shaving is amazing and,ep087
1197,you've got nice countertops two sinks,ep087
1200,for the kids no crown holding even your,ep087
1203,right so this is the master bedroom,ep087
1206,yeah look there's some crown molding up,ep087
1209,there there is technically you're right,ep087
1212,though and what's this closet Oh so,ep087
1215,reaching close instead of a walk-in well,ep087
1218,at least there's his and hers but,ep087
1221,there's another one in the bathroom okay,ep087
1224,I think it's cute in here you love it I,ep087
1227,like the black and white well and I like,ep087
1230,the new tile in here too in this shower,ep087
1233,looks real nice it's a big spacious,ep087
1236,shower two sinks no two thumbs up it's a,ep087
1239,little unsymmetrical here with the round,ep087
1242,and the square and the two lights there,ep087
1245,and the four lights here you can have,ep087
1248,this one under the spotlight yeah yeah,ep087
1251,that'll work,ep087
1254,what did you think overall well I did,ep087
1257,like that it is move-in-ready it's not,ep087
1260,craftsman like I wanted the kitchen I,ep087
1263,could see it needs updating yeah but,ep087
1266,that view is amazing,ep087
1269,I love the outdoor space I love the,ep087
1272,bathrooms upstairs but I'm not happy,ep087
1275,with there being an upstairs and it,ep087
1278,doesn't have that wraparound porch I was,ep087
1281,kind of looking for - and there's the,ep087
1284,fireplace that you like there is a,ep087
1287,fireplace you're right so there's some,ep087
1290,things to think about here after seeing,ep087
1293,several options Paul and Heather will,ep087
1296,have to decide what's most important to,ep087
1299,them a chef's kitchen a low-maintenance,ep087
1302,yard or enough space for the entire,ep087
1305,family I think I know it's one year the,ep087
1308,Pope,ep087
1311,[Music],ep087
1314,this is our magic place,ep087
1317,Paul is ready to choose a waterfront,ep087
1320,home for him and his girlfriend slash,ep087
1323,agent Heather they've looked at several,ep087
1326,options around his 425 thousand dollar,ep087
1329,budget and now it's time to make a,ep087
1332,decision so let's talk about the canal,ep087
1335,double lot for 350 great kitchen in,ep087
1338,there it was fairly close to a chef's,ep087
1341,kitchen it had two fireplaces had a huge,ep087
1344,yard Pro nice big yard yeah gone too,ep087
1347,much to maintain but the inside has your,ep087
1350,crown moldings you want if that's some,ep087
1353,Craftsman style all right so let's talk,ep087
1356,about the White House for 450 yeah I,ep087
1359,loved walking into the sunset on that,ep087
1362,dock it was spectacular,ep087
1365,it had that open concept that we wanted,ep087
1368,yeah had a fireplace and a walk-around,ep087
1371,porch I didn't like that there was no,ep087
1374,stainless steel in the kitchen yeah and,ep087
1377,it really wasn't much of a chef's,ep087
1380,kitchen that loft I thought that third,ep087
1383,bedroom would work and it's just not,ep087
1386,going to let's talk about the pool house,ep087
1389,for 425,ep087
1392,it wasn't Craftsman style that I really,ep087
1395,liked no but the door was unique it,ep087
1398,wasn't open-concept all the rooms seemed,ep087
1401,to be closed off in there and it does,ep087
1404,have stairs outdoor living space is,ep087
1407,perfect they could imagine cooking out,ep087
1410,by the pool the kitchen it's gonna need,ep087
1413,to be updated there are four bedrooms,ep087
1416,there and that works well can,ep087
1419,accommodate the whole family I think I,ep087
1422,know which one you're gonna pick,ep087
1425,[Music],ep087
1428,well a few think it's the poolhouse,ep087
1431,you're right that was the right one at,ep087
1434,outdoor living space it was the whole,ep087
1437,package it was amazing I think we should,ep087
1440,put it in an offer,ep087
1443,all right I'll get on that looks perfect,ep087
1446,it might be a little to the left,ep087
1449,okay we've only been in the house about,ep087
1452,a day it feels great,ep087
1455,the house was listed at 425 I ended up,ep087
1458,paying for 14 I compromised on not,ep087
1461,having a true craftsman house doesn't,ep087
1464,have the open concept that I really,ep087
1467,wanted but the house overall really,ep087
1470,works for us sure you put that right,ep087
1473,over on the counter over there I'm gonna,ep087
1476,get that kitchen up to the best chef's,ep087
1479,kitchen I can I have not cooked in the,ep087
1482,kitchen yet if I could cook outside,ep087
1485,every day I just do that you want to eat,ep087
1488,yes just like y'all want you to like,ep087
1491,that okay here you go,ep087
1494,he's a fantastic cook cook inside or,ep087
1497,outside will eat anywhere feels great I,ep087
1500,love the outdoors,ep087
1503,we already enjoyed the pool and started,ep087
1506,grilling already and we're gonna do some,ep087
1509,paddleboarding later on today and we're,ep087
1512,loving it this home represents a happy,ep087
1515,place and I sanctuary that we can all,ep087
1518,live enjoy the inside and out this can,ep087
1521,be our forever home right on the water,ep087
12,looks like a barn in the living room I,ep088
15,could put the animals in here,ep088
18,New Jersey native Chrissy is trying to,ep088
21,convince husband Matt to buy a house,ep088
24,with plenty of land for an animal,ep088
27,sanctuary I don't know if there's enough,ep088
30,space for pigs or goats and I like that,ep088
33,and while she's open to renovation it's,ep088
36,not open-concept Lauren but you can,ep088
39,perhaps remove this wall all right do,ep088
42,that bob was coming he wants,ep088
45,move-in-ready but there's one project,ep088
48,he's willing to take on perfect spot for,ep088
51,a year and all and with each house,ep088
54,having its quirks there's a planter,ep088
57,behind the sink,ep088
60,whoa taste the rainbow who will win oh,ep088
63,it is just the furthest thing for my,ep088
66,style,ep088
69,all right aside from what Negative Nancy,ep088
72,is talking about over here,ep088
75,I actually kind of like the kitchen,ep088
78,[Music],ep088
81,I'm Chrissy and I own two health,ep088
84,wellness businesses I'm Matt and I'm a,ep088
87,pipe fitter I have two kids from a,ep088
90,previous marriage one boy and one girl,ep088
93,and we have a dog named Lulu and two,ep088
96,rabbits hey bud we first met about ten,ep088
99,years ago,ep088
102,that's a funny story his uncle and my,ep088
105,dad used to work together mm-hmm,ep088
108,and they became friends and Matt was,ep088
111,actually at my first wedding as a guest,ep088
114,and then he was the star of the second,ep088
117,wedding I was at both Chrissy's weddings,ep088
120,weird we've been married a little over a,ep088
123,year now shut up I am a lot different,ep088
126,than her I don't worry about anything,ep088
129,never has a plan no plans I on the other,ep088
132,hand type a but at the end of the day we,ep088
135,have a good time you really want to,ep088
138,leave this town my parents live here so,ep088
141,we'll always be here Somerville is a two,ep088
144,square mile town everybody knows,ep088
147,everybody we have a really great,ep088
150,downtown area which we can ride our,ep088
153,bikes to so it's a really great little,ep088
156,town to live in we just sold our home,ep088
159,recently this was the right time to sell,ep088
162,because we were over flowing our closets,ep088
165,our basement we had no more storage if,ep088
168,we wanted to expand our family we needed,ep088
171,to move morning dirt we moved in here,ep088
174,with my parents and my grandmother,ep088
177,because we sold our house way quicker,ep088
180,than we thought which was awesome but,ep088
183,then we had no place to go and now we're,ep088
186,here while we are on our house on I,ep088
189,prefer a cape cod or craftsman-style,ep088
192,homes because I just feel like they're,ep088
195,very homey but also I feel that I like,ep088
198,the separation of the bedrooms being on,ep088
201,one floor living space on the second,ep088
204,floor I think you should have a ranch,ep088
207,house I agree,ep088
210,going up and down steps they're,ep088
213,dangerous you slip you got socks the,ep088
216,only reason he wants ranch is because,ep088
219,the steps,ep088
222,when you gotta work on yeah I want a big,ep088
225,renovation so that it's exactly as we,ep088
228,want it I'm the visionary in the,ep088
231,relationship so I could see with some,ep088
234,hard work and some time what it could be,ep088
237,I may be allergic to sweating what they,ep088
240,can't agree on is hardwood floors in an,ep088
243,open kitchen that's light and bright,ep088
246,bathrooms the secret to a happy,ep088
249,prosperous marriage is separate,ep088
252,bathrooms I don't have to pull long,ep088
255,blonde hair out of the sink separate,ep088
258,bathrooms this way they go three,ep088
261,bathrooms and a urinal nice call,ep088
264,what guy doesn't want here no I know a,ep088
267,lot of men that don't have urinals yeah,ep088
270,but I'm gonna have one I'll clean it,ep088
273,Matt wants to stay in Somerville,ep088
276,but Chrissy would rather live in one of,ep088
279,the neighboring towns that are in the,ep088
282,country I want at least an acre two,ep088
285,acres would be ideal so that I can have,ep088
288,a Farm Sanctuary not just for dogs but,ep088
291,for all animals so pigs cows horses I'm,ep088
294,not looking for a lot of land to hinder,ep088
297,my wife's addiction to adopting animals,ep088
300,you have animals I do I like to see them,ep088
303,I don't like to feed them I don't like a,ep088
306,pickup after room they need four,ep088
309,bedrooms and a separate office for,ep088
312,Chrissie we're looking like around the,ep088
315,450 450 would be I am the CFO in this,ep088
318,family so I say we can go up to 500 she,ep088
321,has to cut the check not me but I'm the,ep088
324,CEO of this joint and I still would like,ep088
327,the 450 range I don't want you paying,ep088
330,rent here I think the hardest part of,ep088
333,our home search is going to be finding,ep088
336,something that we can both compromise on,ep088
339,at the end of the day I know it's gonna,ep088
342,happen so I'm really not worried about,ep088
345,it,ep088
348,and I am first up a house in the nearby,ep088
351,town of Somerset I think it's like a,ep088
354,cottage Cape Cod the house is not a,ep088
357,ranch that's gonna be a downfall for me,ep088
360,hey guys this is a 1978 cottage-style,ep088
363,home and there are two full acres of,ep088
366,land for animals the list price is four,ep088
369,hundred and seventy nine thousand nine,ep088
372,hundred dollars all right it's in my,ep088
375,budget not mine I'm compromising on yo,ep088
378,do you have marriage,ep088
381,oh yes beauty beauty so this would be,ep088
384,your formal living room but looks like a,ep088
387,barn in the living room I could put the,ep088
390,animals in the living room,ep088
393,what do you guys think about the space,ep088
396,it's a little small for a living space,ep088
399,okay but the high ceilings make us feel,ep088
402,bigger follow me into the kitchen all,ep088
405,right there's a nice pass-through that's,ep088
408,awesome it's really cool I like this it,ep088
411,reminds me of like a 50s diner a lot of,ep088
414,cabinet space are just great however you,ep088
417,ready for it,ep088
420,what's happening she's gonna paint the,ep088
423,cabinets white bingo there's nothing,ep088
426,wrong with them what about the space oh,ep088
429,you like them fine yeah whatever it's,ep088
432,just not one of them all right right off,ep088
435,your kitchen is this really cool,ep088
438,entertaining space right deck great for,ep088
441,entertaining so let's talk about the,ep088
444,yard so you got a lot of it it's a good,ep088
447,size we would definitely have to put a,ep088
450,fence up definitely a fence up if you,ep088
453,want animals okay well good thing we,ep088
456,don't want animals and then we won't,ep088
459,have to put a fence up the backyard is,ep088
462,big which I love,ep088
465,plenty of space for animals for the kids,ep088
468,and the dogs to run around this is your,ep088
471,first floor mean bath Wow is it a,ep088
474,bathroom or is it a restroom,ep088
477,I've been corrected okay clawfoot tub,ep088
480,cool cool cool but no shower you see,ep088
483,what they have hooked up right now is a,ep088
486,it is an extensive showerhead that's,ep088
489,great to shower my animals yes Chanel,ep088
492,the tile is classic so yeah could work,ep088
495,with it the perfect spot for a year and,ep088
498,all ah they look at two small bedrooms,ep088
501,maybe a home office if there's no,ep088
504,designated office space somewhere in the,ep088
507,house then yes where are the other,ep088
510,bedrooms the other bedrooms are on the,ep088
513,second level I don't like being on a,ep088
516,separate floor from the kids because I,ep088
519,can't hear them in the middle of the,ep088
522,night so it just makes everybody's life,ep088
525,easier if we're on the same floor check,ep088
528,this out look how cool this is this is,ep088
531,cool she's like you could see everything,ep088
534,yeah this would be your master bedroom,ep088
537,it's so wood all small for a master ok,ep088
540,so this is a master bath,ep088
543,definitely a renovation I really don't,ep088
546,want it of course that doesn't mind it,ep088
549,my wife wants to repaint and do all this,ep088
552,that and the other thing it doesn't need,ep088
555,it just leave it alone so this is a,ep088
558,second floor bedroom which I think will,ep088
561,be really cool for a kid's room we got,ep088
564,some purple and gold it's very eggplant,ep088
567,that's very cosmetic right you're right,ep088
570,very cosmetic yeah it does actually have,ep088
573,an ensuite oh wow it's got everything,ep088
576,you need this could actually kind of be,ep088
579,my bathroom right now goes the urinal,ep088
582,could go here opossum I'm okay with not,ep088
585,saying yes I'll take it okay you think,ep088

621,I love the land lots of space for,ep088
624,animals I don't like that it has a lot,ep088
627,of land but you know that I know that,ep088
630,the bonus space upstairs that was,ep088
633,probably my favorite part of the house,ep088
636,pretty cool I like the kitchen,ep088
639,I don't love that the bedrooms aren't,ep088
642,all on the same floor okay I like the,ep088
645,house okay,ep088
648,I was just hoping that you could maybe,ep088
651,show us a little something along the,ep088

675,and Matt are looking for a spacious,ep088
678,family home to share with her kids in,ep088
681,Somerville New Jersey but Matt is,ep088
684,reluctant to go with her desire to have,ep088
687,acreage for their growing list of pets,ep088
690,"armed with a budget of $500,000 they've",ep088
693,seen a cottage in Somerset on two acres,ep088
696,perfect for Chrissy but they felt it was,ep088
699,small and the bedrooms weren't on the,ep088
702,same floor today they're back in,ep088
705,Somerville look it's a ranch yeah it's,ep088
708,not a Cape Codder craftsman hey how are,ep088

714,hello checkerboards this is a 1957 ranch,ep088
717,also has a finished basement and outside,ep088
720,you have almost a half of an egg oh,ep088
723,that's it all right all right,ep088
726,"this home is listed at $399,900 I like",ep088
729,that it looks like it needs a lot of,ep088
732,work which is awesome I love it I don't,ep088
735,love it what's come on this would be,ep088
738,your kitchen area Wow if you're talking,ep088
741,about renovation lots of space to do,ep088
744,whatever you want it is a great space oh,ep088
747,wow there's a planter behind the sink,ep088
750,yeah can we talk about that for a moment,ep088
753,there's dirt I'm not really sure I I,ep088
756,think maybe flowers you think flowers,ep088
759,for the kitchen to brighten up your,ep088
762,wife's day she's bright enough this is,ep088
765,your dining room living room combination,ep088
768,it's not open-concept Lauren but you can,ep088
771,perhaps remove this wall all right but,ep088
774,the wall can be removed so follow me out,ep088
777,here it's a nice feature to have a deck,ep088
780,you know for entertaining I like the,ep088
783,size of the backyard you got a decent,ep088
786,amount of space there is a rabbit hutch,ep088
789,which I noticed right however I can't,ep088
792,have pigs or goods,ep088
795,and our cows I know this is really,ep088
798,disappointing for Chrissy finding a home,ep088
801,that has everything that she and Matt,ep088
804,want for their family,ep088
807,that has that acre to two acres it's,ep088
810,really going to be difficult this is a,ep088
813,lot of panel is what it is this is,ep088
816,actually I think a perfect area for you,ep088
819,to have your office Crissy well that I,ep088
822,like they look at two bedrooms on their,ep088
825,way to the first bathroom,ep088
828,did you see the gold on the sink I did,ep088
831,gold theme again when you come in here,ep088

849,a master is there a master bath there is,ep088
852,a master bath whoo whoa taste the,ep088
855,rainbow look at the space in here you,ep088
858,can create whatever you want yeah you,ep088
861,could take out that wall and make the,ep088
864,shower bigger maybe it would open up the,ep088
867,space yep she would want to do the,ep088
870,updates and she would want to do the,ep088
873,renovations and do I trust my wife yes,ep088

885,lower level I think you're gonna really,ep088
888,like it Wow,ep088
891,this is an awesome added space I'm,ep088
894,loving this over here this is your own,ep088
897,personal web bar it's dated but I like,ep088
900,it definitely a lot of potential down,ep088
903,here and a really great space they check,ep088
906,out a guest bedroom in the basement this,ep088
909,is unexpected so this is pretty cool,ep088
912,this is the full bath on the lower level,ep088
915,so it's a little more updated yeah then,ep088
918,the ones upstairs and this is Matt's,ep088
921,bathroom you're right it is and you know,ep088
924,what goes in here I never at all I love,ep088
927,that it's a huge project cool yeah not,ep088
930,so much the huge project it's under,ep088
933,budget which is awesome plenty of money,ep088
936,for rent oh that's the issue I love that,ep088
939,there's an office space,ep088
942,the biggest disappointment for me was,ep088
945,the yard which was not a disappointment,ep088
948,for me right the whole downstairs I,ep088
951,thought was great plenty of room for the,ep088
954,how can we forget about the yard oh,ep088
957,that's a big plus okay it would be,ep088
960,awesome if you could show us something,ep088
963,with more land,ep088
966,something that's not as outdated now,ep088
969,Matt and Chrissy are heading to a house,ep088
972,that gives them the space that they want,ep088
975,25% off your first four weeks,ep088
978,[Music],ep088
981,temporarily living with her parents in,ep088
984,Somerville New Jersey Chrissy and Matt,ep088
987,are ready to buy a house that they for,ep088
990,two kids and their future children can,ep088
993,grow into so far they've seen a cottage,ep088
996,on two acres of land perfect for Chrissy,ep088
999,who wants to have an animal sanctuary,ep088
1002,but it was two stories which Matt didn't,ep088
1005,like the other place was a ranch ideal,ep088
1008,for Matt but it needed a lot of work and,ep088
1011,a lot was too small for her hoping to,ep088
1014,please both their agent has lined up a,ep088
1017,more updated house in nearby branch burg,ep088
1020,that has more land,ep088
1023,oh here's the house I don't like it it,ep088
1026,is really cute landscaping is beautiful,ep088
1029,and it's a two-story you know I love my,ep088
1032,steps no no I don't hey guys I know it's,ep088
1035,not necessarily either of your styles,ep088
1038,it's an 1850 renovated colonial and just,ep088
1041,over an acre of land maybe some animals,ep088
1044,right or maybe not some animals a list,ep088
1047,price for this home is 534977 an area I,ep088
1050,like the ceilings the hardwood floors,ep088
1053,are beautiful yes and they're hardwood,ep088
1056,forests throughout okay yeah they are,ep088
1059,throughout all right so that's awesome,ep088
1062,this would be your kitchen Wow,ep088
1065,it's a beautiful kitchen okay it is just,ep088
1068,the furthest thing for my style,ep088
1071,definitely more of a white light and,ep088
1074,brave kitchen right aside from what,ep088
1077,Negative Nancy is talking about over,ep088
1080,here I actually kind of like the kitchen,ep088
1083,Matt doesn't spend a lot of time in the,ep088
1086,kitchen,ep088
1089,unless he's eating and he's always,ep088
1092,looking in the refrigerator so as long,ep088
1095,as the refrigerator is functioning Matt,ep088
1098,doesn't really care what the kitchen,ep088
1101,looks like this would be your main,ep088
1104,living area all right there's plenty of,ep088
1107,room for activities in here yeah it's,ep088
1110,open to the dining room right out these,ep088
1113,doors over here is your backyard all,ep088
1116,right it's a good size,ep088
1119,the paver patio is beautiful,ep088
1122,definitely enough space for the rabbit,ep088
1125,and the dog yeah I don't know if there's,ep088
1128,enough space for pig or goat and I like,ep088
1131,that this is your first floor main bath,ep088
1134,but it is the only bath on the first,ep088
1137,floor it's okay,ep088
1140,I think I like it yeah I think there's,ep088
1143,definitely enough room for a urinal this,ep088
1146,is the only bathroom on the main floor,ep088
1149,you're not putting a urinal for it all,ep088
1152,of our guests and everybody are going to,ep088
1155,go how many bathrooms three there's hope,ep088
1158,you better hold it right so if you,ep088
1161,follow back here this is a perfect,ep088
1164,office space for you this is awesome I,ep088
1167,like this they head upstairs to look at,ep088
1170,two bedrooms for the kids and the second,ep088
1173,bathroom it's pretty tight I never like,ep088
1176,I guess kids or something,ep088
1179,I think Matt might like it I feel like,ep088
1182,Matt doesn't like it oh I just don't see,ep088
1185,room for a urinal see no in this room,ep088
1188,would be your master bedroom,ep088
1191,wow wow wow ceilings are amazing they're,ep088
1194,awesome they're really cool oh yeah this,ep088
1197,is a big shower yeah it is also two,ep088
1200,sinks I like it so you said this was a,ep088
1203,four bedroom house we have only seen,ep088
1206,three here's a fourth oh no way it's,ep088
1209,like a secret space Wow,ep088
1212,all right awesome the exposed brick on,ep088
1215,the chimney is right so cool I feel like,ep088
1218,the kids would never get out of here,ep088
1221,right,ep088
1224,there are four bedrooms in this house,ep088
1227,unless the kitchen share the room the,ep088
1230,kids would have to be on the opposite,ep088
1233,for than us that is a con for me,ep088
1236,[Music],ep088
1239,it's a really unique house I like the,ep088
1242,ceilings I do like that there's a,ep088
1245,separate office base for me right I wish,ep088
1248,that all the bedrooms were on the same,ep088
1251,floor I don't like the fact that there's,ep088
1254,no place for a urinal it's over budget,ep088
1257,so there's not a ton of room really to,ep088
1260,do any projects now it's time to choose,ep088
1263,since Matt and Chrissy don't agree on,ep088
1266,much it may come down to office space,ep088
1269,open concept and price we really ought,ep088
1272,to make a distance among,ep088
1275,newlyweds Matt and Chrissy have been,ep088
1278,searching Somerville for a house for,ep088
1281,their growing family now that they've,ep088
1284,"seen several homes around their $500,000",ep088
1287,price range they're ready to make a,ep088
1290,decision what did you think about that,ep088
1293,1978 cottage at the land that was within,ep088
1296,my budget at four hundred and seventy,ep088
1299,nine thousand nine hundred dollars but,ep088
1302,it's over yours I do love the fact that,ep088
1305,it's move-in ready,ep088
1308,it is the house that is the most amount,ep088
1311,of land that's awesome for me awesome,ep088
1314,for you and you loved the kitchen right,ep088
1317,that bonus space is perfect for the kids,ep088
1320,I didn't like that the bedrooms were not,ep088
1323,on the same floor and we would have to,ep088
1326,turn one of the bedrooms into an office,ep088
1329,space so that makes working from home,ep088
1332,well ruff what do you thing about that,ep088
1335,1957 dated ranch well within both of our,ep088
1338,budgets at three hundred ninety nine,ep088
1341,thousand nine hundred,ep088
1344,that it's a ranch it does have four,ep088
1347,bedrooms and three baths one bedroom is,ep088
1350,on the lower level in the finished,ep088
1353,basement right however if I gave up the,ep088
1356,office space we could make all four,ep088
1359,bedrooms be on the same floor there is a,ep088
1362,perfect spot for my urinal but it is,ep088
1365,under half an acre of land which is even,ep088
1368,more reason why I love it the thing that,ep088
1371,I love most about the dated ranch is,ep088
1374,that it's a major fixer and I know you,ep088
1377,don't want to do a lot of work I don't,ep088
1380,what do you think about the 1850,ep088
1383,renovated colonial I mean it was the,ep088
1386,most expensive out of both of our,ep088
1389,budgets at five hundred and thirty four,ep088
1392,thousand nine hundred,ep088
1395,I do like the hardwood floors yeah,ep088
1398,they're beautiful it's also very open I,ep088
1401,think that that house is move-in ready,ep088
1404,except there's really no place to put,ep088
1407,the urinal in the house it's the most,ep088
1410,expensive house we looked at that's,ep088
1413,definitely a con for me we really ought,ep088
1416,to make a decision yeah you're right we,ep088
1419,do you know I really love the ranch it's,ep088
1422,one story,ep088
1425,it's my ranch style you don't like,ep088
1428,Saracen yes I will be okay with going,ep088
1431,with the dated a ranch if you let me do,ep088
1434,exactly what I want to do with it time,ep088
1437,to think about it cuz I don't done,ep088
1440,[Music],ep088
1443,we got the keys to our house about a,ep088
1446,month ago however we still haven't even,ep088
1449,moved in yet we're still living with my,ep088
1452,parents and Donna we had some issues,ep088
1455,with the permits we finally got permits,ep088
1458,so we are excited that we could start,ep088
1461,"demo this one it was listed at $399,900",ep088
1464,"we offered $350,000 and it was accepted",ep088
1467,so not only did we come in under budget,ep088
1470,I got the house that I wanted at the,ep088
1473,location that I wanted I'm pretty much,ep088
1476,the king suite all those renovations,ep088
1479,start as excited as I am for the big,ep088
1482,renovation it does mean we have to stay,ep088
1485,with Nana for another three to four,ep088
1488,months until renovation is done and then,ep088
1491,we can move in and the best part is I,ep088
1494,totally have space for my urinal I,ep088
1497,compromise a ton with this house I don't,ep088
1500,have a lot of land for my animals which,ep088
1503,makes me sad makes me happy however I,ep088
1506,did get the separate office space that I,ep088
1509,wanted so that'll be nice working from,ep088
1512,home and I do get to customize it,ep088
1515,exactly how I want it all that I'm gonna,ep088
1518,cut this huh yeah that's really nice,ep088
1521,it's not great so another day she gets,ep088

114,City to buy were the third largest,ep089
117,metropolitan area in the country we have,ep089
120,the most reasonable real estate prices,ep089
123,around we're a third of New York City or,ep089
126,LA there's nothing like Chicago during,ep089
129,the fall James and I are very,ep089
132,comfortable with each other both of our,ep089
135,personalities mesh well because we both,ep089
138,say it like it is yeah I'm excited to,ep089
141,start looking at some properties with a,ep089
144,"budget of 450,000 dollars he's on the",ep089
147,hunt for a two-bedroom plus office but,ep089
150,something to me was this I work a lot,ep089
153,from home so I want dedicated office,ep089
156,space and he wants a second bedroom for,ep089
159,guests location wise he's looking to,ep089
162,stay near the action close to downtown,ep089
165,in Lincoln Park I like the charm of this,ep089
168,building I mean it looks classic Chicago,ep089
171,when I go on runs I run past these,ep089
174,gorgeous historic red brick or,ep089
177,brownstone row type homes with a lot of,ep089
180,charm and I want one James thinks a more,ep089
183,contemporary high-rise or mid-rise would,ep089
186,be a smarter choice I understand the,ep089
189,charm of a vintage walk-up but in the,ep089
192,dead of winter when you're lugging,ep089
195,groceries up three flights of stairs you,ep089
198,might regret that so I want to show you,ep089
201,some elevator buildings high rise,ep089
204,wouldn't be my first choice but if I,ep089
207,found a high-rise that I loved I would,ep089
210,need it to have views it looks like,ep089
213,there's some work that would definitely,ep089
216,need to be done my goal would be to find,ep089
219,something that I can just walk into,ep089
222,but James who's also a contractor thanks,ep089
225,Timmy should consider investing in a,ep089
228,fixer-upper real estate is a very fluid,ep089
231,business and as I've been doing this,ep089
234,I've really found enjoyment on,ep089
237,renovating finding a property with good,ep089
240,bones and beautifying it I'm looking,ep089
243,forward to helping Timmy find a property,ep089
246,that needs a little love and I will be,ep089
249,there to help,ep089
252,for him so he doesn't get overwhelmed,ep089
255,throughout the process it's the unknowns,ep089
258,that concern me that's why it would feel,ep089
261,like a safer decision to move into an,ep089
264,already finished place I like that,ep089
267,there's at least a fireplace there right,ep089
270,it doesn't look to be wood-burning I,ep089
273,think it's gas Chicago gets very cold in,ep089
276,the winter and it would be great to just,ep089
279,be able to get home from work set a fire,ep089
282,and relax an updated kitchen would be a,ep089
285,plus and a large master is a given,ep089
288,preferably I'd like a good walk-in,ep089
291,closet vintage buildings there's no,ep089
294,closet space at the turn-of-the-century,ep089
297,most people only had five outfits Timmy,ep089
300,wears five outfits in a day as for the,ep089
303,master bath but I love that tub I would,ep089
306,love to have a vintage clawfoot tub it's,ep089
309,something that I picked up on in design,ep089
312,magazines the idea sounds good I just,ep089
315,don't think it's that practical they're,ep089
318,big they're bulky they weigh about 500,ep089
321,pounds there you go miss James one of,ep089
324,the things I love about James this place,ep089
327,is his outdoor space and what he's done,ep089
330,with it,ep089
333,I would love to recreate something like,ep089
336,this and the place we find for me an in,ep089
339,unit washer and dryer rounds out the,ep089
342,list I'm very excited about being a,ep089
345,first-time home buyer and I'm gonna be,ep089
348,here to help him find it today James is,ep089
351,showing Timmy a vintage walk up in,ep089
354,Lincoln Park the unit we're looking at,ep089
357,today is the entire second storey so,ep089
360,built in 1880 Wow the curb appeal is,ep089
363,amazing I love the vintage charm of this,ep089
366,place what's that Joyce so that's the L,ep089
369,okay we're unfortunately backed up to,ep089
372,the L on this property and that's,ep089
375,probably why it's three hundred and,ep089
378,forty thousand dollars that's low in,ep089
381,this neighborhood I'm guessing it for,ep089
384,some work that needs to be there's gonna,ep089
387,be some work but I mean the Showell is,ep089
390,here this is a beautiful home great okay,ep089
393,let's go take a look great all right,ep089
396,here we go you got your 10-foot ceilings,ep089
399,I love the ceilings good 14 inch massive,ep089
402,baseboards yeah those baseboards are,ep089
405,really cool do you think they're,ep089
408,original I do you can tell by how many,ep089
411,layers of paint on them the floors I'm,ep089
414,not so sure I don't think these are,ep089
417,original,ep089
420,I would actually rip all this up okay,ep089
423,continue the hardwood down the hall and,ep089
426,into both bedrooms how much would you,ep089
429,put on sticker price for that around,ep089
432,"$10,000 for the whole apartment yeah",ep089
435,"okay but again we're at $340,000 way",ep089
438,under your budget what do you think,ep089
441,about these,ep089
444,pocket doors here you know I really like,ep089
447,them it kind of keeps with the history,ep089
450,of the place so you're gonna hate me for,ep089
453,this but I would say actually rip this,ep089
456,entire wall out why you get a lot more,ep089
459,that natural light pouring into the back,ep089
462,of this room I'd be really sad to lose,ep089
465,this frame something like that is what,ep089
468,makes this place so cool I love the,ep089
471,fireplace look at these great windows it,ep089
474,adds so much character and also a ton of,ep089
477,light and I also love the ivy creeping,ep089
480,up through that window you feel like,ep089
483,you're in the trees so what's nice is,ep089
486,this property you have only two bedrooms,ep089
489,one bathroom but you have this really,ep089
492,cool little nook that I think you can,ep089
495,use as a great office space yeah this is,ep089
498,a great little space so let's take a,ep089
501,look at the master bed here okay,ep089
504,you got two large windows but we're,ep089
507,looking at a brick wall,ep089
510,um this is tight well it's vintage,ep089
513,fortunately this closet for vintage is,ep089
516,fairly large yeah this isn't bad oh my,ep089
519,gosh the Claude foot bathtub yeah do you,ep089
522,also see how much space is taking up in,ep089
525,here you also want a two bath and this,ep089
528,is your only bathroom in this home and,ep089
531,it's taken over by this clawfoot tub I,ep089
534,say it has to go the vanity is terrible,ep089
537,the tile also is horrendous this this,ep089
540,room requires a lot of work but I still,ep089
543,think there's room here to keep the tub,ep089
546,alright so there's good news and bad,ep089
549,news,ep089
552,goodness it's a vintage building with,ep089
555,essential air bad news is you don't have,ep089
558,any unit washer and dryer okay I mean,ep089
561,that's disappointing in my price range I,ep089
564,kind of expect to have an in unit,ep089
567,washer/dryer so luckily we have a lot of,ep089
570,space here for it I would say you're,ep089
573,probably gonna be looking at 35 to,ep089
576,"$4,000 but it can be done okay",ep089
579,so the costs are continuing to pile up,ep089
582,in this place that's best vintage right,ep089
585,so it looks like they recently did the,ep089
588,kitchen okay if I was designing your,ep089
591,kitchen I would ever choose dark granite,ep089
594,I think there's a few cleanup items that,ep089
597,would look great fast and easy adding a,ep089
600,backsplash changing the handles I just,ep089
603,don't think it immediately needs a full,ep089
606,renovation they see the second bedroom,ep089
609,then head out back,ep089
612,oh my god this is loud it's loud you're,ep089
615,right on the tracks here so the good,ep089
618,thing is this is a huge deck space yeah,ep089
621,I can see the potential obviously the,ep089
624,Train is a big con so we can never get,ep089
627,rid of this train noise and the future,ep089
630,buyer is always going to hear that this,ep089
633,is - let's go inside there's some clear,ep089
636,pros I love the vintage charm the,ep089
639,fireplace the clawfoot tub the high,ep089
642,ceilings and then also this is my ideal,ep089
645,location the cons are kind of obvious,ep089
648,there's only one bathroom a small master,ep089
651,bedroom and obviously the train going,ep089
654,past all the time kinda kills the,ep089
657,relaxation behind that outdoor space the,ep089
660,bones of this place are amazing as,ep089
663,Timmy's Realtor and friend I'm,ep089
666,encouraging to buy a fixer-upper because,ep089
669,I want him to gain equity I just am not,ep089
672,sure if I want to take on that big of a,ep089
675,renovation at this time of my life so,ep089
678,james lines up the move-in ready place,ep089
681,Timmy wants but that comes at a cost,ep089
684,it's getting more near the top of my,ep089
687,budget so I'm hoping there's not too,ep089
690,much work to be done,ep089
693,[Music],ep089
696,[Applause],ep089
699,Chicago attorney Timmy is buying his,ep089
702,first home and he's turned to his friend,ep089
705,and broker James for help real estate to,ep089
708,me is really interesting every day is,ep089
711,different you know I work with all,ep089
714,different clients some good some bad,ep089
717,luckily Timmy's a good one help I'm the,ep089
720,good one working with four hundred and,ep089
723,fifty thousand dollars they've seen a,ep089
726,walk up with a vintage charm Timmy wants,ep089
729,in Lincoln Park but it needed a lot of,ep089
732,work so today James has lined up a,ep089
735,move-in-ready mid-rise we're in the,ep089
738,heart of River West right now walking,ep089
741,distance to downtown to your office okay,ep089
744,the elves right here yeah this is,ep089
747,actually the first-ever neighborhood I,ep089
750,lived in Chicago so it's a special area,ep089
753,to me what do you think of the exterior,ep089
756,there's no charm yes right it's a little,ep089
759,sterile for you but it's a two-bedroom,ep089
762,"two-bath its $425,000 $425,000 is",ep089
765,getting more near the top of my budget,ep089
768,so I'm hoping there's not too much work,ep089
771,to be done it really only needs cosmetic,ep089
774,work okay so this is obviously not,ep089
777,vintage but I'm gonna show you why I,ep089
780,brought you here okay take a right right,ep089
783,here wow this is a spectacular view,ep089
786,great when you walk in you have the,ep089
789,entire Chicago skyline right in front of,ep089
792,you the floor-to-ceiling windows give it,ep089
795,so much natural light in here yep and,ep089
798,even better we won't go up there today,ep089
801,because it's raining but you have a,ep089
804,common roof deck that the building,ep089
807,shares that's pretty cool but I see a,ep089
810,private balcony which kind of feels like,ep089
813,a build out of the whole living room so,ep089
816,what do you think of this great room,ep089
819,kind of feel space you know one thing I,ep089
822,noticed right away is there's no real,ep089
825,hardwood floors you're right this is a,ep089
828,laminate floor you're looking at about,ep089
831,10 to 12 thousand dollars to add,ep089
834,hardwood to the entire units so a pretty,ep089
837,penny in the first project yes another,ep089
840,thing I noticed is there's no fireplace,ep089
843,but the wow factor in this room is,ep089
846,definitely the views I just don't think,ep089
849,there's anything that compares to the,ep089
852,Chicago skyline what do you think about,ep089
855,the finishes in here well I like that,ep089
858,the kitchen is kind of part of the,ep089
861,living room that's great for hosting it,ep089
864,just reminds me of one of these nicer,ep089
867,rental buildings I've lived in in law,ep089
870,school and,ep089
873,I'm not a fan you're looking at around,ep089
876,"$14,000 for full cosmetic and appliance",ep089
879,update in the kitchen the place is,ep089
882,"already $425,000 so I don't have as much",ep089
885,wiggle room right to spend on renovation,ep089
888,right I would suggest you do the floors,ep089
891,first and then you can live with this,ep089
894,for a little bit and update as you go on,ep089
897,down the hall they see a full guest bath,ep089
900,it's great to have someplace that guests,ep089
903,can use that's not in my bedroom and,ep089
906,then right here to the right we have the,ep089
909,full-size stackable washer and dryer,ep089
912,great I'm glad that this isn't a project,ep089
915,that I'd have to do so here's the second,ep089
918,bedroom what do you think yeah I mean,ep089
921,it's solid I didn't see a designated,ep089
924,office space in the living room so I,ep089
927,think I need to add a desk in here I,ep089
930,mean it's not the cool,ep089
933,office space yet I am looking for but,ep089
936,it's very functional okay so huge master,ep089
939,bedroom plenty of room for a king-size,ep089
942,bed what do you think I mean these,ep089
945,windows are great this whole unit is,ep089
948,using great windows for natural light,ep089
951,and take a look in there oh yeah this is,ep089
954,a big place this is a big walk-in closet,ep089
957,I have a good amount of clothes and I,ep089
960,can easily fill this closet he's never,ep089
963,gonna find enough storage space or,ep089
966,closet space in a vintage building this,ep089
969,is perfect for him and here you go your,ep089
972,massive full-size on Swedes it would be,ep089
975,cool if we did a clawfoot tub here that,ep089
978,would be an excellent space for it very,ep089
981,much in renovation though it feels a,ep089
984,little more than cosmetic yeah but not,ep089
987,right away and it really truly is,ep089
990,cosmetic you keep the layout you just,ep089
993,touch the surfaces so what do you think,ep089
996,that view blew me away and then the fact,ep089
999,that there was an outdoor space that was,ep089
1002,private was enough for me the ceilings,ep089
1005,are very high the in unit washer and,ep089
1008,dryer was great and it was two beds in,ep089
1011,two full baths I know that it's still,ep089
1014,within my budget but we talked about a,ep089
1017,lot of projects that weren't she a,ep089
1020,concern is when I do all of that I still,ep089
1023,won't feel the charm,ep089
1026,it still doesn't really jive with what I,ep089
1029,wanted going into this process which is,ep089
1032,a cool vintage place to make my own,ep089
1035,so James lines up another vintage place,ep089
1038,and it's move-in-ready but Tim you might,ep089
1041,have to sacrifice on location this is a,ep089
1044,fun-filled shirt James but we are so far,ep089
1047,north,ep089
1050,go Timmy with the help of his friend and,ep089
1053,broker James is on the hunt for a condo,ep089
1056,near the action in Chicago,ep089
1059,alright guys push the pace with four,ep089
1062,hundred and fifty thousand dollars to,ep089
1065,spend Timmy has seen two homes in great,ep089
1068,city locations his preferred vintage,ep089
1071,walk-up that needed a ton of work and a,ep089
1074,move-in-ready mid-rise that was a bit,ep089
1077,too contemporary for his taste so today,ep089
1080,James has found a turnkey vintage place,ep089
1083,but it's in Rogers Park seven miles,ep089
1086,north of the city this is a fun field,ep089
1089,trip James but we are so far north but,ep089
1092,there's something really special about,ep089
1095,this area is that you actually have,ep089
1098,condo buildings that are built on the,ep089
1101,lake the view is incredible something,ep089
1104,like this in Lincoln Park,ep089
1107,Gold Coast it doesn't even exist I knew,ep089
1110,Rodgers Park was a wild card when I,ep089
1113,brought to me here but I want to open,ep089
1116,his mind a little bit and kind of give,ep089
1119,him some ideas outside the box the curb,ep089
1122,appeal of the building is great it was,ep089
1125,built in the 20s and you wouldn't,ep089
1128,believe the price for something like,ep089
1131,this it's three hundred and seventy-nine,ep089
1134,thousand okay,ep089
1137,I'm interested to see it alright so,ep089
1140,check it out yeah so here we go,ep089
1143,take it look those ceilings yeah those,ep089
1146,are pretty high and it for a vintage,ep089
1149,it's real bright I think part of what's,ep089
1152,throwing me off initially are the color,ep089
1155,tones okay this wall has texture too to,ep089
1158,it I'm not a fan of that either,ep089
1161,for 379 these are just cosmetic fixes,ep089
1164,and that's something we can easily do,ep089
1167,after we close I like that there's a,ep089
1170,fireplace it's a gas fireplace what do,ep089
1173,you think of the floors the floors are,ep089
1176,really nice and what's nice here you,ep089
1179,have a little nook that you can use for,ep089
1182,your office again that is nice I like,ep089
1185,that that's near the window so you have,ep089
1188,sensual AC and then you have the radiant,ep089
1191,heat in the winters okay,ep089
1194,I actually I like the look of the,ep089
1197,radiator that's one of the vintage,ep089
1200,touches in here that I actually like,ep089
1203,alright let's take a look at the second,ep089
1206,bedroom great let's do it,ep089
1209,again you got the wood floors in here,ep089
1212,and it's actually for vintage it's a,ep089
1215,pretty good sized second bedroom this is,ep089
1218,a solid second bedroom they see a full,ep089
1221,guest bath that's really convenient in,ep089
1224,case I do have guests,ep089
1227,then head to the kitchen never my,ep089
1230,favorite but the finishes again are real,ep089
1233,nice it's been recently updated new,ep089
1236,stainless-steel appliances I don't love,ep089
1239,the color tone of the cabinets easy,ep089
1242,paint then maybe even like a subway tile,ep089
1245,backsplash yeah,ep089
1248,so this master bedroom is amazing it's,ep089
1251,huge and you have the best views in the,ep089
1254,house every morning you the thought of,ep089
1257,waking up to that view every morning is,ep089
1260,incredible you don't have a huge closet,ep089
1263,over here but what I'm really excited to,ep089
1266,show you though is once you take a look,ep089
1269,in here oh there we go,ep089
1272,full-size side-by-side washer/dryer you,ep089
1275,never see that this is great that this,ep089
1278,is a project that I wouldn't have to do,ep089
1281,this is a second full sized bathroom,ep089
1284,nice size bright I mean once again the,ep089
1287,style wouldn't be mine I think a log,ep089
1290,Cherie clawfoot tub would look great,ep089
1293,over there I'm hoping he's gonna let me,ep089
1296,get my hands dirty on that master bath,ep089
1299,it's got a little bit generic tile in,ep089
1302,there some ceramic and it's an easy,ep089
1305,quick fix and it would make a dramatic,ep089
1308,difference in the unit and again we're,ep089
1311,"at $379,000 here to spend other money",ep089
1314,and update the unit doesn't have a,ep089
1317,private outdoor space but there's a,ep089
1320,large shared patio how incredible is,ep089
1323,this this is gorgeous I mean I feel way,ep089
1326,out of the city which is obviously a con,ep089
1329,but to have this private beach area just,ep089
1332,for this community it's so rare and it's,ep089
1335,practically yours practically mine but,ep089
1338,not completely mine right but I can't,ep089
1341,argue with this all right what do you,ep089
1344,think I like the style the building and,ep089
1347,then the views I never imagined that I,ep089
1350,could find a place right on the lake to,ep089
1353,be honest I didn't know what existed in,ep089
1356,Chicago we had a washer and dryer in,ep089
1359,unit a huge master bedroom and all at a,ep089
1362,price point that's still far within my,ep089
1365,budget,ep089
1368,one thing that is gonna be very hard for,ep089
1371,me to get over is the location the rest,ep089
1374,of the country thinks seven miles may,ep089
1377,not be that far away in Chicago that's a,ep089
1380,world away I'm in the suburb up here,ep089
1383,you're technically still in Chicago zip,ep089
1386,code and the owl is just a walk away so,ep089
1389,I think it's a lifestyle he might be,ep089
1392,able to get used to,ep089
1395,if I sleep on it I'll be ready to make a,ep089
1398,decision okay good there's a lot to,ep089
1401,consider but ultimately Timmy may have,ep089
1404,to choose between a home that's move-in,ep089
1407,ready has vintage charm or is in the,ep089
1410,heart of the city I think I'm ready okay,ep089
1413,[Music],ep089
1416,it's time to make a decision right Timmy,ep089
1419,has four hundred and fifty thousand,ep089
1422,dollars to buy his first place in,ep089
1425,Chicago with the help of real estate,ep089
1428,broker and contractor James he's seen,ep089
1431,both fixer-uppers and move-in-ready,ep089
1434,options now it's decision time,ep089
1437,so the Lincoln Park property is three,ep089
1440,hundred forty thousand dollars this is,ep089
1443,my ideal location the charm was just so,ep089
1446,amazing having a wood-burning fireplace,ep089
1449,was so cool to me but with that level of,ep089
1452,vintage charm comes a smaller master,ep089
1455,bedroom the train noise is a definite,ep089
1458,con and also it would require a lot of,ep089
1461,work the mid rise modern Lauren Ginn,ep089
1464,"25,000 it really had no charm but it's",ep089
1467,two-bedroom two-bath and you get tons of,ep089
1470,natural light outdoor space that was,ep089
1473,private the views were amazing yeah,ep089
1476,however there were some pricey,ep089
1479,renovations we discussed now let's talk,ep089
1482,about the wild card property the Rodgers,ep089
1485,Park,ep089
1488,lakefront three hundred seventy nine,ep089
1491,thousand two bedroom two bath I never,ep089
1494,knew that Chicago even had lakefront,ep089
1497,properties like that I did like that it,ep089
1500,was vintage that being said there was no,ep089
1503,private outdoor space but the master,ep089
1506,bedroom was massive the question is if I,ep089
1509,can get over that location it's time to,ep089
1512,make a decision I think I'm ready,ep089
1515,I think it's clear I love the Lincoln,ep089
1518,Park vintage after seeing a few,ep089
1521,different properties it made it clear to,ep089
1524,me that to get the style and decor I,ep089
1527,want in my ideal location I've got to go,ep089
1530,into somewhat of a blank palette I'm a,ep089
1533,little nervous about the renovation I'm,ep089
1536,gonna guide you through it just know,ep089
1539,there's gonna be a lot of stress since,ep089
1542,you're going with this one yeah let's,ep089
1545,start knocking stuff down let's get to,ep089
1548,work all right so these are two options,ep089
1551,for subway tile I closed on the property,ep089
1554,six weeks ago and here I am in the,ep089
1557,middle of construction zone the exciting,ep089
1560,part for me is creating this old old,ep089
1563,home into something that fits my,ep089
1566,personality this bathroom has to be,ep089
1569,finished before your lease is up so you,ep089
1572,can move in here this home was,ep089
1575,"healthfully within my budget at $340,000",ep089
1578,we ended up paying three hundred,ep089
1581,thirty-seven thousand dollars to vintage,ep089
1584,touches that I'm so psyched to have in,ep089
1587,this place or the stained glass on the,ep089
1590,big front window that's very dramatic,ep089
1593,and also I've got my wood-burning,ep089
1596,fireplace and I'm having so much fun,ep089
1599,picking design finishes that match with,ep089
1602,the classic charm of my place you know I,ep089
1605,like the penny tile and the hexagon look,ep089
1608,I'm redoing all the floors I got rid of,ep089
1611,the pocket doors between the dining room,ep089
1614,in the living room to create a big open,ep089
1617,space another thing I did that maybe,ep089
1620,took away a little bit of the charm and,ep089
1623,ate at my heartstrings a little bit was,ep089
1626,I got rid of that clawfoot tub I mean,ep089
1629,admittedly I'm really excited to just,ep089
1632,have a big walk-in shower I got it out,ep089
1635,of the wall between the bathroom and the,ep089
1638,utility closet and we're doing a big,ep089
1641,bathroom renovation we're gonna have a,ep089
1644,stacked washer/dryer okay right here on,ep089
1647,this side we're gonna have the full,ep089
1650,stand-up shower with the subway tile and,ep089
1653,then we're gonna have the black hexagon,ep089
1656,floor here one good thing I found taking,ep089
1659,down the wall between the utility closet,ep089
1662,and the bathroom was a window appeared,ep089
1665,so we're gonna pop this window out bring,ep089
1668,the exterior down so the windows gonna,ep089
1671,fit and look like it's built in James,ep089
1674,and I sat down to go over a realistic,ep089
1677,budget and we came to the number of,ep089
1680,"$40,000 it's gonna look like a great",ep089
1683,showcase bathroom when it's done with,ep089
1686,all the finishes we've talked about I'm,ep089
1689,excited,ep089
1692,all right good I'm glad a few things,ep089
1695,that I'm not,ep089
1698,can be able to change about this,ep089
1701,property are the bedroom sizes and the,ep089
1704,noise from the trains however at this,ep089
1707,price point in this neighborhood I'm not,ep089
1710,really too concerned about it,ep089
1713,this property is history in the city,ep089
1716,that I love the most when I don't plan,ep089
1719,to move anytime soon probably never,ep089
12,Oh beautiful fireplace first-time buyers,ep090
15,Mandy and Eddie need more space for,ep090
18,their growing family in Rochester New,ep090
21,York oh yeah what do you think do you,ep090
24,want a new house yes or no no problem is,ep090
27,they're horrified by each other's taste,ep090
30,look at the stonework oh I love the,ep090
33,style these are vinyl yes this carpet,ep090
36,could stay I don't understand how you,ep090
39,think this perfect instead let's go back,ep090
42,to that will she get the conventional,ep090
45,starter home she wants but can he talk,ep090
48,her into a sprawling space with a lot of,ep090
51,quirks what is this I don't even know,ep090
54,what to say,ep090
57,[Music],ep090
60,and you have the leaded glass windows,ep090
63,they're beautiful,ep090
66,I'm Andy this is my husband Eddie and,ep090
69,we're in Rochester New York I'm a local,ep090
72,real estate agent I'm a chiropractor,ep090
75,here in Rochester this shows your spine,ep090
78,three dimensionally we've been together,ep090
81,for seven years we have a daughter she's,ep090
84,a little over a year and a half her name,ep090
87,is Ileana and we've got another one on,ep090
90,the way,ep090
93,when did you bring around the Rosie with,ep090
96,aunt Abby I grew up in Canandaigua which,ep090
99,is just about 30 45 minutes away from,ep090
102,Rochester her parents come up on a dime,ep090
105,anytime we need to help and we're so,ep090
108,grateful for that,ep090
111,where's grandpa's nose I grew up in,ep090
114,Stony Creek Ontario Canada I captured,ep090
117,him he came here for school and I didn't,ep090
120,let him leave my family we're really,ep090
123,tight-knit,ep090
126,they're like Italian Canadian like right,ep090
129,off the boat from Italy it's offensive,ep090
132,my wife fits in really well my wife has,ep090
135,a lot of awesome attributes she takes,ep090
138,care of my life let me tell you picked,ep090
141,up right where my mom left she's pretty,ep090
144,awesome Rochester is really diverse,ep090
147,there's just a lot of great people and,ep090
150,it's just a very easy comfortable place,ep090
153,to live I don't ever want to move from,ep090
156,Rochester I really like it here so they,ep090
159,want to invest in their own home in the,ep090
162,suburbs but they found house-hunting to,ep090
165,be surprisingly daunting as a,ep090
168,realization I always look at every house,ep090
171,through the lens of someone else,ep090
174,figuring out what I want in a house is,ep090
177,actually surprisingly hard she,ep090
180,overthinks a lot of big purchases and I,ep090
183,under think a lot of big purchases so,ep090
186,they've recruited Mandy's sister Abbie,ep090
189,also a real estate agent to help them so,ep090
192,tell me what you're looking for in your,ep090
195,next home I really just want a starter,ep090
198,house,ep090
201,the biggest thing we disagree on is that,ep090
204,he thinks we're ready for a forever,ep090
207,house and I don't think that at all,ep090
210,we live in an apartment now we don't,ep090
213,really know what we want and that's why,ep090
216,we really need a starter home to figure,ep090
219,that out I grew up in one home when I,ep090
222,was in Canada so like my parents were,ep090
225,there for decades,ep090
228,one home I don't want to start her home,ep090
231,because we're gonna have to move again,ep090
234,in five years and I would really like it,ep090
237,to be a home that we can stay in for the,ep090
240,duration of our little ones lives my,ep090
243,ideal house is a three bedroom one and a,ep090
246,half bath colonial with the functional,ep090
249,layout where there's an office but still,ep090
252,able to have open concept and an area,ep090
255,for a playroom that we can shut off and,ep090
258,some sort of a backyard for our dog and,ep090
261,for our children ivy let's get down to,ep090
264,business here you know what I want I'd,ep090
267,like more space to live in,ep090
270,four bedrooms two bathrooms Mandy and I,ep090
273,our relationship flourishes when we have,ep090
276,separate bathrooms appearance-wise,ep090
279,Eddie wants something a lot like his,ep090
282,childhood home in Canada,ep090
285,I don't know the perfect term for it but,ep090
288,the style is cool the homes that I grew,ep090
291,up in there was just a lot of character,ep090
294,to the home a lot of wood accents,ep090
297,three-quarters of land there was a,ep090
300,fountain there was a fireplace and there,ep090
303,was hardwood it's all fitting I know,ep090
306,about why that's what I'm looking for,ep090
309,there it is and you hate vinyl too right,ep090
312,I want stone on the outside double vinyl,ep090
315,siding so tell me if Mandy's on this end,ep090
318,of the spectrum Eddie you're over here,ep090
321,where your price points at my price,ep090
324,point is 150 thousand my price point is,ep090
327,anywhere that gets me everything I want,ep090
330,it's around three hundred thousand you,ep090
333,guys are really on the same page here,ep090
336,first up Abbey has found a colonial,ep090
339,starter home she thinks Mandy will like,ep090
342,I love the style the shutters the door,ep090
345,is a vinyl yes come on just give it a,ep090
348,chance okay let's check it out,ep090
351,hey you know how much I love my wife I,ep090
354,walked in this house final side I know,ep090
357,I'm sorry,ep090
360,let me tell you a little bit about this,ep090
363,house so three bedrooms one and a half,ep090
366,"bathrooms 1,800 square feet list price",ep090
369,is one hundred and fifty five thousand,ep090
372,dollars oh that's right up your alley,ep090
375,yes it definitely is turnkey move-in,ep090
378,ready they both have businesses they,ep090
381,have a Liana and they have a baby on the,ep090
384,way I think it would be a really good,ep090
387,idea for them to move into a smaller,ep090
390,starter home and then upgrade a few,ep090
393,years down the line when their family,ep090
396,continues to grow this is a nice big,ep090
399,room I'll tell you what I do like off,ep090
402,the bat is the form this is this,ep090
405,original hardwood yep original hardwoods,ep090
408,throughout the whole first floor and is,ep090
411,that the gas fireplace yes it's close,ep090
414,closer right off the main living room,ep090
417,here we have actually a playroom and,ep090
420,it's huge now what do you guys think,ep090
423,about the outdoor space that we can see,ep090
426,from here I don't know it's great that,ep090
429,they have a play set but I'm not seeing,ep090
432,a lot of one where she can be playing,ep090
435,outside mm-hmm so we have a dining room,ep090
438,space here all right and then the,ep090
441,kitchen right after okay I love the,ep090
444,cabinets and maybe it's because the,ep090
447,appliances are gorgeous and I'm obsessed,ep090
450,with this eat-in area yeah I want the,ep090
453,kids to be able to eat while we're in,ep090
456,the kitchen or have a space to hang out,ep090
459,so even though it's not open-concept I,ep090
462,think it still could function the way,ep090
465,that I would want with the layout okay,ep090
468,so then we also have a full basement,ep090
471,that's actually partially finished all,ep090
474,right let's check this out all right so,ep090
477,this is an interesting setup that's,ep090
480,really interesting what they did there,ep090
483,with TV and everything Eddie I think,ep090
486,most people would use a man cave to,ep090
489,watch like football or basketball is,ep090
492,this where you'd watch your kids movies,ep090
495,yeah I mean Aliana yeah they'd watch one,ep090
498,on here and I get to really,ep090
501,[Music],ep090
504,here we go with our first bedroom okay,ep090
507,so it's a little small so this would be,ep090
510,like all the honors yet yeah or the new,ep090
513,baby's room we have the full bath on,ep090
516,this floor well I love how it's updated,ep090
519,but nice I feel like it's it's very,ep090
522,small for our marriage it's always,ep090
525,better to have two sinks two toilets two,ep090
528,showers all right this is a good-size,ep090
531,room there's like good character in the,ep090
534,home but you know me I'm just not,ep090
537,leaning towards a starter home so how,ep090
540,many years give me a time frame how many,ep090
543,years do we have I thought good four to,ep090
546,five years in 45 years okay this home is,ep090
549,definitely not big enough for me I want,ep090
552,to make sure that we can grow into it,ep090
555,and we're not gonna have to move too,ep090
558,quick this is an awesome starter home,ep090
561,financially it makes so much sense and,ep090
564,also I don't think that we're ready for,ep090
567,a forever house here we have the master,ep090
570,bedroom,ep090
573,this is a nice size okay overall I think,ep090
576,the bedroom sizes are great I definitely,ep090
579,think that one is really small whether,ep090
582,I'd use that as my office or if it would,ep090
585,be more of a nursery or baby's room the,ep090
588,outdoor space I'm not crazy about I'm,ep090
591,really not seeing as much grass as I had,ep090
594,in mind I love the price I love the,ep090
597,option for the playroom so it's designed,ep090
600,beautifully like the house was made,ep090
603,really nice but it's just like it's a,ep090
606,little bit small how long could this,ep090
609,really last roast like it's in our price,ep090
612,range but like how long till you make us,ep090
615,move because right but I mean that's the,ep090
618,whole process of a starter home it just,ep090
621,makes a lot of sense for us and we're,ep090
624,gonna really gain a perspective on,ep090
627,what's important for our forever home,ep090
630,instead of trying to decide that right,ep090
633,now I'm just on the fence about some,ep090
636,things since Eddie wants to see a larger,ep090
639,place with a stone exterior Abby,ep090
642,delivers big-time yes,ep090
645,look at the stonework,ep090
648,[Music],ep090
651,oh yeah what do you think do you want a,ep090
654,new house yes or no new parents Eddie,ep090
657,and Mandy need more space in suburban,ep090
660,Rochester New York but with up to three,ep090
663,hundred thousand dollars to spend,ep090
666,they're miles apart on what to buy,ep090
669,Eddie dreams of a large stone house the,ep090
672,family can grow in four years but Mandy,ep090
675,is anxious about committing to anything,ep090
678,more than a starter home so far they've,ep090
681,seen a colonial starter that Mandy loves,ep090
684,but Eddie is worried they'll outgrow it,ep090
687,in a few years so today their agent,ep090
690,Mandy's sister Abby has lined up a place,ep090
693,with a little more square footage and a,ep090
696,large grassy lot,ep090
699,I love the cul-de-sac look at the,ep090
702,stonework oh it's beautiful what are you,ep090
705,talking about this is not my style at,ep090
708,all there's just so much stone I like,ep090
711,the stone yes I'm not crazy about it but,ep090
714,what do you have for us three bedrooms,ep090
717,one and a half bathroom that's not ideal,ep090
720,yeah all right so it's currently listed,ep090
723,at one hundred and sixty thousand,ep090
726,dollars hmm so this is the main living,ep090
729,space I mean the carpet doesn't do it,ep090
732,for you,ep090
735,no but I just love the high ceilings,ep090
738,look at the beams look how nice they are,ep090
741,and we got a fireplace yeah nice I,ep090
744,really like how open it is,ep090
747,now when was the house built 1983 yeah I,ep090
750,can tell,ep090
753,everything is ugly in here but I think,ep090
756,it has great potential right no I hear,ep090
759,you,ep090
762,Oh i'll eautiful I love the view I'm,ep090
765,concerned is that a cliff looks like,ep090
768,there's a little bit of a drop-off yeah,ep090
771,it's definitely a cliff it's beautiful,ep090
774,here though a little bit of grass too,ep090
777,it's not so bad I like the space we,ep090
780,would just need to put an offense yeah,ep090
783,that's like right in the budget all,ep090
786,three bedrooms right on the other side,ep090
789,of the house here okay I feel like I got,ep090
792,a walk on this stage at all I know right,ep090
795,it is kind of a weird layout all right,ep090
798,whether this carpet could stay it's not,ep090
801,ideal but it could stay what I am I,ep090
804,don't understand how you think this,ep090
807,traffic can stay let's go back to that,ep090
810,what a Leona's gonna destroy any carpet,ep090
813,we're in this should be like more than,ep090
816,enough for a kid's bedroom agreed here,ep090
819,we have the second bedroom,ep090
822,lovely carpet again see washer and dryer,ep090
825,in a bedroom we could definitely move it,ep090
828,downstairs okay this would be considered,ep090
831,the master bath house yes only one full,ep090
834,bath okay I don't like anything about,ep090
837,the cosmetic this is the biggest bedroom,ep090
840,sighs nice I love the double closets,ep090
843,well let's go to the basement I like,ep090
846,this space so like this could,ep090
849,potentially be like a whole nother,ep090
852,living space yeah,ep090
855,[Music],ep090
858,"overall I like that at 160,000 it's the",ep090
861,price point that I want to be in but,ep090
864,three-bedroom it's a little bit small I,ep090
867,don't want to move in a year I'm not a,ep090
870,fan of the style of this house but I,ep090
873,love how it's open the kitchen we have,ep090
876,the stone front open-concept nice beams,ep090
879,I'm just really concerned about the,ep090
882,cosmetics that are needed throughout the,ep090
885,entire house there's some significant,ep090
888,work that needs to be done for a starter,ep090
891,home that's not what I signed up for,ep090
894,cliff closed the negative and the,ep090
897,three-bedroom you got anything else we,ep090
900,can look at me so now Abbey is taking,ep090
903,them to a much larger more move-in-ready,ep090
906,house but of course it'll cost them so,ep090
909,that's like on the high end of what we,ep090
912,rely on,ep090
915,[Music],ep090
918,man's this way too much meat I love you,ep090
921,do you want to make your own lunch sure,ep090
924,Eddie and Mandy are searching Rochester,ep090
927,New York for their first home within,ep090
930,"their $300,000 max budget but they've",ep090
933,been giving their agent Mandy's sister,ep090
936,Abby a run for her money I love them to,ep090
939,death like they want totally different,ep090
942,things so it's made it pretty difficult,ep090
945,to find them exactly what they're,ep090
948,looking for so far they've seen a,ep090
951,well-priced move-in ready colonial,ep090
954,starter for her then they saw a larger,ep090
957,stone ranch with the exterior look he,ep090
960,likes but it needed work inside and,ep090
963,neither house has the four bedrooms and,ep090
966,two baths Eddie wants so now Abby has,ep090
969,lined up a much bigger place she thinks,ep090
972,will appeal to Eddie there's a lot going,ep090
975,on so let me tell you a little bit about,ep090
978,this house okay very very unique it's,ep090
981,six acres oh man a little bit less than,ep090
984,"3,500 square feet four bedrooms and",ep090
987,three full baths that sound good,ep090
990,it's listed at 299 thousand dollars okay,ep090
993,so that's like on the high end of what,ep090
996,very high end so no stone but it's,ep090
999,better than vinyl siding that's for sure,ep090
1002,there's also a fountain right here on,ep090
1005,the side of the house there's a fountain,ep090
1008,buried under all this ice and snow yeah,ep090
1011,all right well let's come on in okay,ep090
1014,whoa,ep090
1017,this is great space yeah I love the,ep090
1020,ceilings and it has that open concept,ep090
1023,that you want - I do like the open,ep090
1026,concept of it and then it goes into the,ep090
1029,living area beautiful fireplace that's,ep090
1032,pretty cool my favorite aspect of this,ep090
1035,property is that it has the fountain it,ep090
1038,has the fireplace and it's not cookie,ep090
1041,cutter the carpet has to go but it'd be,ep090
1044,an easy fix,ep090
1047,oh man check this out oh the outline,ep090
1050,okay these are original holds this place,ep090
1053,it was built around 1970 okay so these,ep090
1056,are definitely gonna need to be replaced,ep090
1059,awesome,ep090
1062,Wow I love this deck this is a lot of,ep090
1065,Lynne Wow but I feel that because it's,ep090
1068,so sloppy there's not a lot of place for,ep090
1071,soccer balls to play lacrosse,ep090
1074,I love six acres but it just doesn't,ep090
1077,seem very functional for me,ep090
1080,okay let's check out the kitchen,ep090
1083,ah it just looks really dated yeah I,ep090
1086,like the eat-in area you could tell it,ep090
1089,was custom it's kind of funky,ep090
1092,I do wish that it was a bit more open,ep090
1095,and I would definitely feel like we,ep090
1098,would need to put some money into this,ep090
1101,fair enough,ep090
1104,we could just order pizza though we,ep090
1107,could we could just order pizza every,ep090
1110,day there's definitely some cosmetic,ep090
1113,stuff to that we're gonna need to fix,ep090
1116,out but there's so much space for a long,ep090
1119,haul forever home we could make this,ep090
1122,"work but 299,000 is at the very high end",ep090
1125,of our budget and it just doesn't seem,ep090
1128,like it's a big deal to him oh this is,ep090
1131,really nice,ep090
1134,two sinks in the showers all tile - we,ep090
1137,wouldn't have to do a thing in here and,ep090
1140,that's awesome,ep090
1143,it is really nice so this is the master,ep090
1146,bedroom nice hardwood I love that,ep090
1149,there's the door but again I feel like,ep090
1152,we're gonna need to replace that - Mandy,ep090
1155,I really could see this being your,ep090
1158,office space that's a great eye,ep090
1161,I love these shelves I really like this,ep090
1164,as an office next it's downstairs to see,ep090
1167,the additional beds and baths well we,ep090
1170,have two bathrooms here Eddie and there,ep090
1173,is a sauna this is so cool the rest of,ep090
1176,the at least there's two maybe the,ep090
1179,second one's prettier what is this we'll,ep090
1182,kill the peacock hopefully that would be,ep090
1185,a quick easy fix there's a lot of quick,ep090
1188,easy fixes yeah there's a bit of work,ep090
1191,down the hall they see three bedrooms,ep090
1194,that could work well for the kids then,ep090
1197,head down to see a bonus room this is,ep090
1200,what we like to call the cake what is,ep090
1203,this what do you think I don't even know,ep090
1206,what to say what do you guys think about,ep090
1209,the orange carpet is it weird that,ep090
1212,that's not the first thing that caught,ep090
1215,my eye,ep090
1218,it's sprayed styrofoam was this original,ep090
1221,to the building you know I don't know,ep090
1224,but it's very unique I'll be honest I've,ep090
1227,never seen a cave room before in a house,ep090
1230,and I've been in a few houses I have no,ep090
1233,idea where this cave room came from but,ep090
1236,it's crazy it's a really cool room but,ep090
1239,what what are you gonna do with it,ep090
1242,"for 299,000 this is definitely going to",ep090
1245,fall under the forever home category,ep090
1248,instead of the starter home and I'm just,ep090
1251,really worried about the price what are,ep090
1254,the things we like I really love the,ep090
1257,open concept and I love that with the,ep090
1260,kitchen we could easily open it up yeah,ep090
1263,but I like about it four bedrooms by,ep090
1266,your place fountain sauna the six acres,ep090
1269,is nice but it needs work but it's got,ep090
1272,potential,ep090
1275,right what do you think I'm on the phone,ep090
1278,yeah what about the cave room that was,ep090
1281,weird,ep090
1284,that's the only way to say it now it's,ep090
1287,time to decide a move-in-ready starter,ep090
1290,or a forever home that might need some,ep090
1293,work and Mandy is still anxious about,ep090
1296,their choices how do we know that this,ep090
1299,is what we want,ep090
1302,"Eddie and Mandy have up to $300,000 to",ep090
1305,spend on their first town they've seen a,ep090
1308,number of places now it's time to decide,ep090
1311,I think the obvious one for me was the,ep090
1314,"Colonial listed at $155,000",ep090
1317,it had the playroom I love how the,ep090
1320,kitchen had the eat-in area they had,ep090
1323,some good qualities not the siding but,ep090
1326,it had like nice hardwood floors a hot,ep090
1329,character the biggest challenge for me,ep090
1332,is the one full bath is just so small,ep090
1335,you want an open-concept kitchen didn't,ep090
1338,have that then a lot of the rooms were,ep090
1341,blocked off and smaller we definitely,ep090
1344,will have at least two kids in there at,ep090
1347,that time period and it's just that's,ep090
1350,really tight next is a stone ranch on a,ep090
1353,"cul-de-sac listed for 160,000 dollars it",ep090
1356,needs work but it's got potential there,ep090
1359,are updates that need to be made in,ep090
1362,every single room especially the,ep090
1365,appliances and the cabinets they just,ep090
1368,seemed older to me we had three bedrooms,ep090
1371,do you think that's enough space for you,ep090
1374,guys I don't know smaller but I think it,ep090
1377,was a better fit than that colonial the,ep090
1380,big negative for me with that though is,ep090
1383,the cliff in the back it scares me,ep090
1386,"I liked the ranch in the woods $299,000",ep090
1389,the price is really hard for me to get,ep090
1392,over my four bedrooms we can make this a,ep090
1395,home that were there a lot longer for,ep090
1398,and watch our kids grow up onto unique,ep090
1401,home it's not cookie cutter I really,ep090
1404,loved the open concept I see the value,ep090
1407,in investing in this house that we're,ep090
1410,gonna stay in for a really long time but,ep090
1413,there is work that needs to be done wait,ep090
1416,and there's the cave room yeah it's just,ep090
1419,weird I don't know what we would do with,ep090
1422,it which one will they choose,ep090
1425,I am NOT a fan of the colonial I would,ep090
1428,rather lean towards the ranch in the,ep090
1431,woods or we can have a smaller hole with,ep090
1434,the cliff it feels like I need to just,ep090
1437,get over the numbers I see the value in,ep090
1440,not having to move again the ranch in,ep090
1443,the woods might be the best fit for our,ep090
1446,family that's a place that we can grow,ep090
1449,into can we put an offering it has been,ep090
1452,on the market for a little bit of time,ep090
1455,so we might be able to negotiate that,ep090
1458,could make a huge difference if we could,ep090
1461,get them down okay we'll work your,ep090
1464,girl's magic we actually just got the,ep090
1467,key one week ago Abby did a pretty good,ep090
1470,job she did great we got it for two,ep090
1473,hundred and seventy thousand dollars it,ep090
1476,really made me feel so much more,ep090
1479,comfortable about making this huge,ep090
1482,financial move I played my cards right I,ep090
1485,didn't have to compromise that much it's,ep090
1488,not cookie cutter and it's just a,ep090
1491,beautiful home on a lot of room I,ep090
1494,totally compromised the most however,ep090
1497,there's not as much work as I had,ep090
1500,originally thought that needs to be done,ep090
1503,to the home right away my favorite space,ep090
1506,in this house is definitely the great,ep090
1509,room I love the open concept I love the,ep090
1512,potential we put some bamboo flooring in,ep090
1515,the great room which was really really,ep090
1518,good hey what are you doing don't touch,ep090
1521,my pillow,ep090
1524,Mandy gave me full rein of the cave room,ep090
1527,bad decision guess what we turned it,ep090
1530,into the master bedroom I think it's a,ep090
1533,big assumption people would think we're,ep090
1536,crazy and not assume we're crazy frankly,ep090
1539,the space works really really well for a,ep090
1542,master bedroom,ep090
1545,bathrooms definitely need updating but,ep090
1548,for right now the space is great for,ep090
1551,sure one of the things Mandy's gonna,ep090
1554,want to get done is gonna be the kitchen,ep090
1557,get some sort of an island and just open,ep090
1560,it up as much as possible,ep090
1563,we haven't been here very long and,ep090
1566,alianna is already in her glory we have,ep090
1569,set up her own little playroom and we,ep090
1572,close the door and it is done Ileana,ep090
1575,do you know that there's gonna be,ep090
1578,another baby soon I get maybe a lot of,ep090
1581,respect because he held really strong on,ep090
1584,to the forever home concept I was so,ep090
1587,stubborn about wanting a starter home,ep090
1590,that I'm really happy that he may have,ep090
1593,been right about this we're good on tape,ep090
1596,it is really nice to be in our new place,ep090
1599,you know we finally have a home but,ep090
1602,being a forever home just means that our,ep090
1605,kids have a consistent house that they,ep090
1608,call home this is their home and it's,ep090
1611,always gonna be their home it's just,ep090
1614,really exciting for what's ahead,ep090
12,Carrie and Marty are saying I'll be the,ep091
15,same to their old lives Seattle is,ep091
18,looking as good as it's ever looked for,ep091
21,a chance to get closer to their family,ep091
24,roots in Berlin Germany this is where my,ep091
27,grandparents brought me Marty wants to,ep091
30,experience the city this is really the,ep091
33,reason why we came here this is the,ep091
36,center of Berlin while Carrie wants,ep091
39,what's best for the family the school I,ep091
42,really want the kids to go to is a,ep091
45,45-minute bus train ride yeah I was,ep091
48,hoping like a five minute bike ride yes,ep091
51,10-minute bike ride but if we're in the,ep091
54,city with a banker you gotta consider,ep091
57,the trade on who's driving crazy guys,ep091
60,[Music],ep091
63,so like Seattle my parents came from,ep091
66,Berlin so I'm a dual citizen my kids are,ep091
69,both dual citizens to be German American,ep091
72,you kind of have to embrace both sides,ep091
75,well we've lived in America now we need,ep091
78,to explore what living in Germany is,ep091
81,like as well gary is already in Berlin,ep091
84,and the kids have started school so I've,ep091
87,had a few doubts about our mood is this,ep091
90,the right thing to do to our kids moving,ep091
93,them away from their family and friends,ep091
96,into this country that they don't know,ep091
99,anything about is that the right move as,ep091
102,a parent Josie do you like to school but,ep091
105,I feel like our kids are just right at,ep091
108,the cusp of not wanting to hang out with,ep091
111,us much anymore,ep091
114,so we feel like we caught them right at,ep091
117,the outer edge of them thinking it's,ep091
120,cool to do this adventure with us,ep091
123,Seattle is looking as good as it's ever,ep091
126,looked not a beautiful day absolutely,ep091
129,perfect out there,ep091
132,Marty's bosses have agreed to let him do,ep091
135,his radio show remotely so what exactly,ep091
138,are you gonna do in Berlin it's gotta be,ep091
141,like I'm still here we're gonna we're,ep091
144,gonna fake it well and if it doesn't,ep091
147,work then you're fired and we'll pick,ep091
150,somebody else up is great I've worked,ep091
153,with Jodie my my on-air partner for 10,ep091
156,years by moving to the other side of the,ep091
159,globe that's going to affect the rhythm,ep091
162,just make sure that you manage your,ep091
165,situation so we can keep doing the,ep091
168,shadows I fear at some point the company,ep091
171,or my coworkers are gonna say it's not,ep091
174,worth it,ep091
177,enjoy yourself in Berlin and that,ep091
180,concerns me,ep091
183,Berlin is such an amazing mix of that,ep091
186,German efficiency like the buses and the,ep091
189,trains run on time right we're here and,ep091
192,then that weird artsy community that was,ep091
195,the result of it being buried behind the,ep091
198,Iron Curtain,ep091
201,Berlin is aidan enormous city to school,ep091
204,I really want the kids to go to is a,ep091
207,45-minute bus train ride and I'm really,ep091
210,hoping to find a house close enough to,ep091
213,the school the real estate market in,ep091
216,Berlin is really really tough these days,ep091
219,as it's like in the middle of Europe so,ep091
222,guys let me know what you are looking,ep091
225,for four bedrooms would be ideal we'd,ep091
228,say four thousand US dollars a month I,ep091
231,do a radio show in Seattle and I need,ep091
234,quiet space that I can call a studio,ep091
237,where the kids don't annoy me I really,ep091
240,want to be near the kids school okay,ep091
243,this is where we disagree because I want,ep091
246,to experience Berlin and I think most of,ep091
249,that is happening in the city center so,ep091
252,we can take a train to the city from the,ep091
255,suburb right that's that's gonna be our,ep091
258,issue will drive me crazy guys Marty and,ep091
261,Kerry are looking for really different,ep091
264,things he's more focused on his job she,ep091
267,just wants the best for her family I'm,ep091
270,going to have a hard journey here,ep091
273,Simon decides to focus on Marty first so,ep091
276,he's taking them to an ideal location in,ep091
279,hopes to win Kerry over with something,ep091
282,unique hey I feel like we're in the,ep091
285,center because we just stepped across,ep091
288,where the old Berlin Wall used to run,ep091
291,yeah definitely and how about this is to,ep091
294,school I would say on a good day it's 30,ep091
297,minutes on a bad day 45 minutes okay and,ep091
300,price-wise what are we looking at here,ep091
303,we are quite at the limit it's four,ep091
306,thousand US dollars a month oh oh okay,ep091
309,this,ep091
312,the entrance yeah like the entrance is,ep091
315,like really special okay so this is,ep091
318,weird because it looks like we're living,ep091
321,in a gallery it is together oh wow yeah,ep091
324,keep an open mind okay Wow so the,ep091
327,entrance to the apartment is through an,ep091
330,art gallery and then when you go,ep091
333,continue through the art gallery then,ep091
336,you're in the apartment here we have the,ep091
339,kitchen and the dining area of the,ep091
342,apartment it seems like our family is,ep091
345,part of a real-life art exhibit this so,ep091
348,yeah definitely that's a funky thing,ep091
351,about the apartment and something,ep091
354,special it's so different from what we,ep091
357,are used to living in that it adds to,ep091
360,the experience of moving to a foreign,ep091
363,country and living in a foreign city,ep091
366,I think Carrie is far more conservative,ep091
369,in that regard so here we have like the,ep091
372,second bedroom and this has like an open,ep091
375,bathtub over there wow that's really,ep091
378,open it's literally right in the middle,ep091
381,of the bedroom you kinda have to walk,ep091
384,around the bathtub to get to the bed,ep091
387,there's not really a lot of privacy yeah,ep091
390,we have the patio and also it is the,ep091
393,connection to the second part of the,ep091
396,apartment so this is the only outdoor,ep091
399,just the strip of patio yes exactly I,ep091
402,guess we're just used to more open,ep091
405,spaces and where's the city living,ep091
408,she doesn't envision this the same way I,ep091
411,do that she doesn't want to like go out,ep091
414,on a limb and do things differently than,ep091
417,we've done them in the past this is the,ep091
420,second part of the apartment I wanted to,ep091
423,show you a second kitchen exactly yeah,ep091
426,you gotta have a second kitchen here,ep091
429,over here is what I thought could be the,ep091
432,studio for Marty and also your bedroom,ep091
435,oh yeah this is a great space for a,ep091
438,studio that's what I thought would be,ep091
441,such perfect you have your private,ep091
444,studio over here so during the day you,ep091
447,can do your work you are looking at for,ep091
450,me Simon and that's what I like,ep091
453,like seriously this is it I mean it's,ep091
456,gorgeous I really love the studio I,ep091
459,think we could get used to being,ep091
462,somewhat separated from the kids the,ep091
465,kids are getting older they don't need,ep091
468,us like right next door I think that's,ep091
471,kind of silly I mean that's not how you,ep091
474,live your life is having an unattached,ep091
477,apartment from the rest of your family,ep091
480,and on top of that it's 30 it's more,ep091
483,like 45 minutes by public transportation,ep091
486,to the school and the time a long school,ep091
489,day it just doesn't feel like the right,ep091
492,thing to me I'd actually just like to,ep091
495,stay in my studio space you guys go with,ep091
498,me he's never gonna want to leave trust,ep091
501,me,ep091
504,what's the next house I think I have,ep091
507,something a little bit more traditional,ep091
510,oh my gosh it even has an awesome,ep091
513,acoustics for city living it really hits,ep091
516,the mark my issue is its tickle it's not,ep091
519,that close to school this is amazing,ep091
522,this is the Brandenburg Gate this is,ep091
525,where my grandparents brought me and my,ep091
528,sister your aunt when we were your age,ep091
531,Carrie and Marty are expanding their,ep091
534,horizons by taking Marty's job Seattle,ep091
537,is looking as as good as its ever looked,ep091
540,and their family to Berlin Germany Marty,ep091
543,and I have always dreamt of coming and,ep091
546,living in Europe and Germany is the,ep091
549,perfect place Marty's parents grew up,ep091
552,here they went to university here and,ep091
555,we've always dreamt of living here they,ep091
558,couldn't cross because we were in East,ep091
561,Germany there was a wall the Berlin Wall,ep091
564,that kept people from crossing back and,ep091
567,forth so this was like no-man's land,ep091
570,that's awesome this side well actually,ep091
573,yeah but only if you have the right,ep091
576,papers we'd stay with my grandparents,ep091
579,over here in East Germany for a while,ep091
582,and then at the end of our visit we'd,ep091
585,have to cross back over,ep091
588,could you imagine leaving your,ep091
591,grandparents and them not being able to,ep091
594,come with you because of a wall this is,ep091
597,really the reason why we came here,ep091
600,let's let's do what no one else could do,ep091
603,before let's cross underneath it I,ep091
606,wonder if living in Germany for a while,ep091
609,will make me feel a little bit like for,ep091
612,the first time in my life I'm coming,ep091
615,home I hope it brings our family closer,ep091
618,together we're not going with a social,ep091
621,circle we are each other social network,ep091
624,here but so far their apartment search,ep091
627,has been anything but typical so this is,ep091
630,the only outdoor just this strip of,ep091
633,patio she doesn't want to like go out on,ep091
636,a limb and do things differently than,ep091
639,we've done them in the past oh yeah this,ep091
642,is a great space for a studio I mean,ep091
645,it's gorgeous,ep091
648,I do a radio show in Seattle and I'm,ep091
651,gonna try to keep doing it here from,ep091
654,Berlin we can easily turn that into my,ep091
657,studio and it's beautiful I think that's,ep091
660,kind of silly I mean that's not how you,ep091
663,live your life is having an unattached,ep091
666,apartment from the rest of your family,ep091
669,and on top of that it's 30 it's more,ep091
672,like 45 minutes by public transportation,ep091
675,to the school roof the next house I,ep091
678,think I have something a little bit more,ep091
681,traditional and a bit closer to the,ep091
684,school and I think then it's going to be,ep091
687,perfect for them so we are here in the,ep091
690,really center of town I would say the,ep091
693,distance to school is about 20 to 30,ep091
696,minutes by public transport or car yeah,ep091
699,I was hoping like a five-minute bike,ep091
702,ride yeah but if we're in the center you,ep091
705,got to consider the trade-off that on,ep091
708,the weekends then we don't have to take,ep091
711,a bus cuz we're right here,ep091
714,I don't know that me a 30-minute bus,ep091
717,right on each end of their schooldays,ep091
720,long day I think he doesn't really,ep091
723,understand how much that's gonna impact,ep091
726,our life in such a big way but it does,ep091
729,seem like we're on a really busy street,ep091
732,here,ep091
735,no worries the apartment is not that the,ep091
738,street the apartment is at the back,ep091
741,house and there is completely quiet we,ep091
744,have like as promised the four bedrooms,ep091
747,and one and a half bathrooms I could,ep091
750,make that work,ep091
753,well let's can we make it work how much,ep091
756,does it cost thirty five hundred US,ep091
759,dollar a month great,ep091
762,duck duck that's nice I like the high,ep091
765,ceilings yeah let me show you the first,ep091
768,bedroom it's just so were there okay is,ep091
771,this the master no this would be a kid's,ep091
774,room next to it we're gonna have the,ep091
777,same room again,ep091
780,they're huge yeah it's an SRE building,ep091
783,it was built pre-war as a factory oh it,ep091
786,really has nice and high ceilings that's,ep091
789,cool yeah I think living in this place,ep091
792,we would really experience Berlin I'm,ep091
795,sure you're gonna love this bathroom you,ep091
798,can play basketball in here yeah it's,ep091
801,huge and it's completely new but there's,ep091
804,more to see so let's move on this is,ep091
807,like the huge living room and the,ep091
810,kitchen oh this is great I love the,ep091
813,openness of this room I'm a really could,ep091
816,see us you know hanging out here and,ep091
819,having a meal here and kids doing their,ep091
822,homework there what surprised me about,ep091
825,Carrie's reaction is that she liked it,ep091
828,as much as she did,ep091
831,yeah it's true for city living it really,ep091
834,hits the mark but location to where our,ep091
837,kids are gonna go to school is not so,ep091
840,great,ep091
843,let me ask you about the outside there a,ep091
846,backyard no it's like only a terrace but,ep091
849,you know you're in the center of Berlin,ep091
852,so to have a terrace in the middle of,ep091
855,town it's really really lectures and,ep091
858,rare now we come to the highlight this,ep091
861,is the huge master bedroom yeah great,ep091
864,hold on what's this Wow Marty that's my,ep091
867,surprise for you,ep091
870,right now it's a small bedroom but the,ep091
873,bet can be removed and then this is a,ep091
876,perfect place for your studio oh my gosh,ep091
879,it even has awesome acoustics yeah great,ep091
882,I think that's really perfect so oh whoa,ep091
885,what do you think I love it it's a great,ep091
888,car,ep091
891,it is and I really like the open space I,ep091
894,like the modern my issue is still it's,ep091
897,not that close to school since you work,ep091
900,out of the home you don't have to,ep091
903,commute we will have to commute twice a,ep091
906,day and I want a little homier a little,ep091
909,yard yeah maybe that's my American,ep091
912,expectations and I need to get rid of,ep091
915,that yes yes I feel like it's almost,ep091
918,perfect it's just like this much off are,ep091
921,we still in Germany because we drove,ep091
924,forever to get here yeah,ep091
927,when Carrie wants to stay so close to,ep091
930,the school then yeah Marty probably,ep091
933,needs to do a compromise yeah this is,ep091
936,great,ep091
939,really when in Berlin do like winners,ep091
942,we're getting falafel Kerry and Marty,ep091
945,are trying to strike a balance between,ep091
948,work it's got to be like I'm still here,ep091
951,and family as they search for their new,ep091
954,home in Berlin Germany hear all that you,ep091
957,order Carrie and the challenge of living,ep091
960,in a new country has been quite the,ep091
963,learning experience I'm all telephone,ep091
966,honestly I think I'm a talker and even,ep091
969,in my week being here I found that I,ep091
972,can't talk to people so that has felt,ep091
975,like one of my arms of two and my arms,ep091
978,have been cut off this big Steiner he,ep091
981,just said you sound like a real German,ep091
984,I'm not as as social as as carriers you,ep091
987,know people think that if you're in,ep091
990,radio well you've got to be really,ep091
993,social it's you're not because I sit in,ep091
996,a room with three other people that's,ep091
999,delicious,ep091
1002,Marty is a very unique person and I'm,ep091
1005,learning even in my week being here that,ep091
1008,he is very German to the core oh my gosh,ep091
1011,even has awesome acoustics I'm,ep091
1014,understanding him more as we continue,ep091
1017,our time here I'd actually just like to,ep091
1020,stay in my studio space you guys go with,ep091
1023,without me it's so different from what,ep091
1026,we are used to living in that it adds to,ep091
1029,the experience of moving to a foreign,ep091
1032,country,ep091
1035,living in a foreign city I really like,ep091
1038,the open space I like the modern my,ep091
1041,issue is still it's not that close to,ep091
1044,school we will have to commute twice a,ep091
1047,day I'm gonna look now for a place which,ep091
1050,is really really close to the school and,ep091
1053,forget about the central location so,ep091
1056,that at this time maybe can convince,ep091
1059,Carrie,ep091
1062,are we still in Germany because we drove,ep091
1065,forever to get here not only in Germany,ep091
1068,are we we are still in Berlin oh of,ep091
1071,course it's not the city center anymore,ep091
1074,but we are really close to school and,ep091
1077,its maximum of five minute bike ride and,ep091
1080,it's way under your budget we have a,ep091
1083,monthly rent of 3100 US dollars a month,ep091
1086,so let's go inside I'll show you the,ep091
1089,house all right look living in the,ep091
1092,outlying areas scares me a bit sure,ep091
1095,maybe at the beginning we'll still,ep091
1098,venture into the city from time to time,ep091
1101,but otherwise we'll get lazy and we,ep091
1104,won't go in to see the museums and the,ep091
1107,sights in the city centre please come in,ep091
1110,we got a really authentic German kitchen,ep091
1113,but it has modern devices in it yeah,ep091
1116,this is great,ep091
1119,really it's old and small yeah reminds,ep091
1122,me very much of my grandparents when I,ep091
1125,used to come to Germany and visit when I,ep091
1128,was a kid so that's kind of my weird,ep091
1131,hang-up about the place so guys please,ep091
1134,come in into a huge living room and a,ep091
1137,really nice dining room and is that our,ep091
1140,yard just for us yeah that's God,ep091
1143,I'll show you it's really nice this is,ep091
1146,great,ep091
1149,yeah okay I see that yard and I totally,ep091
1152,get that that's a great play area for,ep091
1155,the kids but I also wanted to get away,ep091
1158,from having to maintain a yard by coming,ep091
1161,to Europe and moving into the city here,ep091
1164,we come to the second floor I think,ep091
1167,that's a really,ep091
1170,nice room what do you think yeah this is,ep091
1173,great I hear a little squeak in the,ep091
1176,floor stop dead guys you're driving me,ep091
1179,nuts I think that's like the typical,ep091
1182,feeling about a real wooden floor I did,ep091
1185,it makes a bit of salt okay it's got,ep091
1188,high ceilings and wood floors so it's a,ep091
1191,little creaky and an echo II for the,ep091
1194,radio show that's not gonna work wait go,ep091
1197,ahead squeak next floor and we come to,ep091
1200,the next and last bedroom or what I,ep091
1203,thought it could also be your studio so,ep091
1206,what do you guys think I love it's near,ep091
1209,school that is yeah perfect it has a,ep091
1212,yard perfect it has a room for you yeah,ep091
1215,but I'm still I'm still so skeptical the,ep091
1218,whole house seems kind of old and tired,ep091
1221,you know squeaky floors and cracked,ep091
1224,concrete and things like that I like it,ep091
1227,it's pretty perfect like I I would be,ep091
1230,hard-pressed to have found a more,ep091
1233,perfect place actually I think Carrie is,ep091
1236,in love with the place so much so that,ep091
1239,she's overlooking the fact that's too,ep091
1242,far out of the city center to work,ep091
1245,it's gonna be nearly impossible for us,ep091
1248,to decide we should quit and go home,ep091
1251,back to see how hey I don't know I don't,ep091
1254,know how to make this decision then yeah,ep091
1257,we will attack it like a German engineer,ep091
1260,would attack we will go one by one,ep091
1263,lemonade eliminate until we have the one,ep091
1266,Marty is looking for a new home in,ep091
1269,Berlin Germany that will let him,ep091
1272,continue his radio show from Seattle,ep091
1275,Washington it's got to be like I'm still,ep091
1278,here we're gonna we're gonna fake it,ep091
1281,well but he'll have to balance it with,ep091
1284,carries needs for a place suitable for,ep091
1287,the entire family I hope it brings our,ep091
1290,family closer together first one is the,ep091
1293,funky art gallery house okay yeah that,ep091
1296,place is certainly unique,ep091
1299,we told Simon I wanted a separate space,ep091
1302,for a studio okay this is it I mean it's,ep091
1305,gorgeous,ep091
1308,okay so then what about the big city,ep091
1311,house I really liked it I really liked,ep091
1314,but it's 30 minutes by train or bus away,ep091
1317,from school I want a little homier a,ep091
1320,little yard you know maybe that's my,ep091
1323,American expectations and I need to get,ep091
1326,rid of that yes yes then about the,ep091
1329,suburb house I love it,ep091
1332,yeah sorry but it's a little bit like a,ep091
1335,haunted house if anyone moves while I'm,ep091
1338,on the air you're gonna hear about this,ep091
1341,stop that guys you're driving me nuts,ep091
1344,[Music],ep091
1347,I've known you long enough to know which,ep091
1350,one you would eliminate so it's part,ep091
1353,calorie house yeah that didn't match us,ep091
1356,and I didn't really feel like becoming,ep091
1359,an art exhibit off the Main Street,ep091
1362,myself no okay now we have to to the big,ep091
1365,city house is it's modern it's quiet and,ep091
1368,that Terrace out there with no yards,ep091
1371,it's just a terrace it's like a it's,ep091
1374,like a deck I mean it's it's Berlin,ep091
1377,I'm just looking at big picture if we're,ep091
1380,here for a long period of time that,ep091
1383,doesn't feel like home don't make me,ep091
1386,live in the suburbs the big qualifier,ep091
1389,there is whether or not the studio works,ep091
1392,out and it's not frivolous to just go Oh,ep091
1395,Marty wants to live downtown I'm worried,ep091
1398,that we're giving up the main reason why,ep091
1401,we came to Germany and Berlin is to,ep091
1404,explore all the history of Berlin which,ep091
1407,happens right there in the center and we,ep091
1410,can do that on the weekends we're not,ep091
1413,gonna do that after school the location,ep091
1416,is still a huge point every single day,ep091
1419,to get up and go to school and to get,ep091
1422,them out the door and then to add,ep091
1425,another 30 possibly 45 minutes if you,ep091
1428,miss a train or a bus I know you're,ep091
1431,tired of me keep coming back to that but,ep091
1434,that is such a big deal to me,ep091
1437,like that is our job while we're here is,ep091
1440,getting to and from school all right I,ep091
1443,am willing to go with you on what you,ep091
1446,think the best decision is so we're,ep091
1449,going with the suburban house really,ep091
1452,yeah this is exciting okay,ep091
1455,by some German army just say I'm heating,ep091
1458,an apple so we love the house where I,ep091
1461,would say the kids are adjusting amazing,ep091
1464,all right man let me hear your German,ep091
1467,numbers go ahead yeah since lunch it all,ep091
1470,the way to 20 we hang outs together so,ep091
1473,much instead of all four of us yeah that,ep091
1476,never really happened in Seattle good,ep091
1479,morning it's Marty and Jody so I've,ep091
1482,managed to set up a studio up in one of,ep091
1485,the upstairs rooms which is away from,ep091
1488,the commotion that goes on I'm able to,ep091
1491,do my show,ep091
1494,it sounds good right now another check,ep091
1497,on your Seattle commute and I am so glad,ep091
1500,we moved so close to school I really,ep091

1506,lifestyle would look like,ep091
1509,[Music],ep091
12,look at this it's free yeah okay for,ep092

33,only words that we both know,ep092
36,everything's so different than what you,ep092
39,see in the news they're cashing out a,ep092
42,successful business in Tampa and,ep092
45,returning to Kelly's homeland of,ep092
48,metazine Columbia I think it's gonna be,ep092
51,a little difficult,ep092
54,oh hello I don't like the floor because,ep092
57,they're like grandma style,ep092
60,the country is changing and I don't know,ep092
63,what to expect show you why like an,ep092
66,American place in,ep092
69,[Music],ep092
72,I didn't know how everything was going,ep092
75,to look like after 11 years but,ep092
78,everything is more more than now yeah I,ep092
81,wasn't in the US for two years when we,ep092
84,met in Florida yep and I was two years,ep092
87,into the sports nutrition business that,ep092
90,I had open what's really started to take,ep092
93,off and skyrocket and I was competing,ep092
96,which take a lot of time and you just,ep092
99,started supporting your family back here,ep092
102,in Colombia so we were both working very,ep092
105,hard it's always been one of my goals to,ep092
108,retire before I was 40 but it was hard,ep092
111,letting go you know it's definitely,ep092
114,rewarding you get the cars the house but,ep092
117,you're putting in so many hours yeah it,ep092
120,was all the time,ep092
123,busy stress and I said that's because,ep092
126,you're making that much money,ep092
129,now you can live with a little less,ep092
132,money more happy yes meal yeah it just,ep092
135,felt like the perfect point now or never,ep092
138,simply sold the business and now it's,ep092
141,her time to show meet her life I want to,ep092
144,see all of it and I want to learn,ep092
147,everything this city is huge,ep092
150,yes when I was a kid militant was,ep092
153,violent with all the narco problems and,ep092
156,it was difficult to grow up with all,ep092
159,that and so I was hesitating but coming,ep092
162,back by always telling him a stories,ep092
165,about Colombia as the beautiful things,ep092
168,we have in here like the food the,ep092
171,beautiful people,ep092
174,the mountains and the different,ep092
177,neighborhoods like El Poblado,ep092
180,they have a lot of nightclubs as,ep092
183,nightlife more people and then shop,ep092
186,Anita where is quiet more traditional,ep092
189,you have a lot of families so I wanna,ep092
192,show him all these things I remember,ep092
195,you were this big it's me,ep092
198,I think a lot of people think that we,ep092
201,are selling those difficult you know,ep092
204,times but the city has changed religion,ep092
207,is a safe city it's a beautiful city so,ep092
210,you can live very well what are you,ep092
213,looking for three bedrooms I'll carry,ep092
216,open to have two bedrooms because you,ep092
219,had two people what do you want three,ep092
222,bedrooms because you know I want my,ep092
225,family to come visit and I think I just,ep092
228,make it a lot more comfortable for,ep092
231,everybody okay hopefully with double,ep092
234,vanity one of them the master bathroom,ep092
237,because it is big guy so we always find,ep092
240,each other trying to get in the bottom,ep092
243,at the same time okay so you were like,ep092
246,an American place in managing so do you,ep092
249,want to be in the area El Poblado that,ep092
252,is close to restaurant bar shops,ep092
255,I think that'd be great make it more,ep092
258,comfortable for me but you know I also,ep092
261,want a quiet place like green open polo,ep092
264,is not that buy it and it's got a lot of,ep092
267,traffic so I'm not sure but I'm more,ep092
270,flexible because I know the city yeah,ep092
273,well another thing I want is a view a,ep092
276,view yeah that's important to both the,ep092
279,vision,ep092
282,beautiful view yeah making me go knows,ep092
285,what's a boy just for that are they,ep092
288,"around 150,000 yes",ep092
291,yeah that's doable but you have to be,ep092
294,open-minded because it's right to get,ep092
297,the most we can okay oh man this way,ep092
300,- Wow Jarrod right out of the gate David,ep092
303,Aames for the Sheik El Poblado,ep092
306,neighborhood it won't be quiet for Kelly,ep092
309,but he's hoping it's familiar ambience,ep092
312,will help make her feel comfortable this,ep092
315,is called,ep092
318,bija Hardeen is San Paulo I can feel the,ep092
321,city life yeah,ep092
324,great location this is 3-bedroom,ep092
327,2-bathroom and it has 360 views the,ep092
330,"price is 135,000 right well though you",ep092
333,will love it welcome guys you know,ep092
336,yourselves thank you it's a huge,ep092
339,it's definitely like a more traditional,ep092
342,floor yeah I don't like the floor too,ep092
345,much but I like the open kitchen is,ep092
348,pretty nice I like it I like the,ep092
351,combination those kind of notices these,ep092
354,giant columns and its relation are,ep092
357,constructions so that I call and it,ep092
360,blocks your movement yeah there's a lot,ep092
363,of light in here this is great very open,ep092
366,I like the windows windows all around,ep092
369,yeah,ep092
372,by the ladder of noise coming from the,ep092
375,Avenue yeah well I've never heard of a,ep092
378,big city without any noise so I kind of,ep092
381,prepared myself for that I think this,ep092
384,place is decent but I think that's an,ep092
387,older style because it's how I grow up,ep092
390,like my grandma style floor,ep092
393,hey it's not my favorite okay so this is,ep092
396,the master bedroom,ep092
399,yes these rooms are very small maybe I'm,ep092
402,just too big I think that's what it is,ep092
405,oh my god this is gonna be tight I can't,ep092
408,even get my brush to my mouth yeah I,ep092
411,know they didn't build these buildings,ep092
414,with people like me in mind the Columbia,ep092
417,style is definitely small bedrooms and,ep092
420,bathrooms but I actually like them and,ep092
423,of course you know if you're right in,ep092
426,the heart of the city so I'm all to make,ep092
429,those compromises their thoughts about,ep092
432,this place I like it you know I like the,ep092
435,kind of traditional feel,ep092
438,it's got three bedrooms at the big plus,ep092
441,yeah a little bit cramped but you know,ep092
444,it's an open bottle which is right here,ep092
447,and the heart of the action I think the,ep092
450,view is really nice by seller of noise,ep092
453,and I don't like the floor because,ep092
456,they're like grandma style,ep092
459,really yes they are,ep092
462,I like it not so much I'm really getting,ep092
465,the feeling from her that she doesn't,ep092
468,want to be in the heart of the action,ep092
471,she doesn't want to be right in the,ep092
474,middle of the city let's go right okay I,ep092
477,know I'm managing pretty well I know,ep092
480,there is a lot of places where we can,ep092
483,live and it can be more green more quiet,ep092
486,welcome to Monticello green and quiet is,ep092
489,actually what David has in mind just not,ep092
492,on the outside this is great it's nice,ep092
495,but I see a lot of traffic and a lot of,ep092
498,nice nobody inside these kind of calm,ep092
501,don't worry if you say it is we trust,ep092
504,you let's take a look let's see oh wow,ep092
507,this is pretty nice after 11 years in,ep092
510,the u.s. kelly is coming home to,ep092
513,meta-gene columbia to settle down with,ep092
516,her husband Jarrett this is what I told,ep092
519,you about everything that's so cool this,ep092
522,is like any other big city except it's a,ep092
525,lot cleaner and there's a lot of fat,ep092
528,statues are active I always tell him the,ep092
531,store in manadena so nice Columbia the,ep092
534,people like I loved it but I was bored,ep092
537,coming back because even if the country,ep092
540,is changing I'm not sure if I can I can,ep092
543,adapt to Columbia again baby,ep092
546,this is the water of culture that they,ep092
549,grow with the bomb in 1995 Fernando,ep092
552,Botero he wanted to keep it so people,ep092
555,remember how the past in Columbia was,ep092
558,I'll show you the resilience the people,ep092
561,the country are tough oh yes,ep092
564,after big the meta-gene and here I am,ep092
567,moving to the city without ever even,ep092
570,being here but I think Kelly you know,ep092
573,probably more nervous to me you know,ep092
576,seeing things experiencing things think,ep092
579,she's really hoping to find a different,ep092
582,city I wanted to make the transition as,ep092
585,easy as possible I want to find a good,ep092
588,environment to find a good location and,ep092
591,start a good life welcome guys,ep092
594,thank you huge David tried to give Kelly,ep092
597,a comfortable homecoming by showing them,ep092
600,a bright three-bedroom apartment in a,ep092
603,popular neighborhood very open I like,ep092
606,the windows windows all around yeah but,ep092
609,it wasn't as comfortable as he hoped,ep092
612,these rooms are very small and I don't,ep092
615,like the floor because they're like,ep092
618,grandma sell really yeah not so much,ep092
621,okay I'm gonna show them another place,ep092
624,in Colorado because Gerald loves to be,ep092
627,in a hog referred Palazzo they won't be,ep092
630,leaving Jarrod's preferred neighborhood,ep092
633,but David's next pick for them will,ep092
636,hopefully improve on aesthetics for,ep092
639,Kelly,ep092
642,welcome to Monticello in the heart of,ep092
645,poblano this is great,ep092
648,I can see nightclubs I can see,ep092

654,traffic and a lot of noise and I miss a,ep092
657,lot of good things going on here no but,ep092
660,inside is kind of calm don't worry this,ep092
663,is a 2-bedroom 2-bath the rooms,ep092
666,bathrooms are big and it's on budget,ep092
669,"150,000 okay",ep092
672,I really wanted three bedrooms I think,ep092
675,you have to check it out it's worth,ep092
678,saying if you say it's good we trust you,ep092
681,let's take a look let's see this way,ep092
684,third bedroom is very important to me I,ep092

711,pretty great ambiance I hear some water,ep092

717,different inside because outside you,ep092
720,feel like everything is gonna be noisy,ep092
723,and traffic but when you get in it's,ep092
726,like very quiet and nice there's one,ep092
729,thing missing though what I'm just,ep092

747,jungle I want to feel like I'm in the,ep092
750,sea,ep092
753,Kelly wanted something quieter even,ep092
756,though Jarrod wanted to be in the heart,ep092
759,of Colorado close to restaurants and,ep092
762,everything so with the sounds of the,ep092
765,creek you know I don't see any reason,ep092
768,why they wouldn't die kid,ep092
771,this is nice what do you think babe all,ep092
774,the appliances look brand-new David yes,ep092
777,they are,ep092
780,yeah this is good it's definitely a very,ep092
783,cool look I like the open concept in,ep092
786,here so I can't interact with the people,ep092

1032,coming back to someone Aida where I used,ep092
1035,to live before I left,ep092
1038,it's very amazing because it's a lot of,ep092
1041,constructions everywhere so it looks so,ep092

1059,front of the view yeah I don't think I'm,ep092
1062,gonna be on this side of the kitchen I'm,ep092
1065,gonna be doing the outside but the,ep092
1068,stainless steel appliances very modern,ep092
1071,looking in this view I think no place in,ep092
1074,folio has this beautiful yeah I love it,ep092
1077,because in here the kitchen is the open,ep092
1080,with the living room mix with the,ep092
1083,balconies so it makes it like a huge,ep092
1086,area I like it this is their first,ep092
1089,bathroom oh that's nice whoa hello,ep092
1092,that's a little smaller it looks I'm,ep092
1095,gonna have to go through sideways one,ep092
1098,maybe you had a little bigger then I,ep092
1101,guess I won't be using this one,ep092
1104,Wow okay this is a master bedroom wow,ep092
1107,this is the smallest master bedroom ever,ep092
1110,seen not too much magic can happen in,ep092
1113,here's stymie but you know high ceilings,ep092
1116,and is very bright and the views amazing,ep092
1119,I love it,ep092
1122,view is pretty nice the floor-to-ceiling,ep092
1125,windows that's that's definitely amazing,ep092
1128,view I'm surprised how everything is a,ep092
1131,little small you know it's not fun,ep092
1134,having to turn sideways to walk through,ep092
1137,bathrooms or you know fit in tight,ep092
1140,spaces you know I have feelings I want,ep092
1143,to be comfortable too is it guest,ep092
1146,bedroom spare bedroom you know I like,ep092
1149,that this place has three bedrooms but,ep092
1152,I'm kind of feeling like they're a,ep092
1155,little small thing is that the social,ep092
1158,area is very big so yeah they compromise,ep092
1161,in the bedrooms,ep092
1164,I was dictum feet don't worry bet in,ep092
1167,here I think he surely likes everything,ep092
1170,it seems like she's more about this,ep092
1173,location,ep092
1176,she loves the view she likes being a,ep092
1179,little bit further out of town but you,ep092
1182,know we got to be comfortable in these,ep092
1185,places wow this is definitely the,ep092
1188,perfect view this view or anyone else,ep092
1191,say what I am getting is a lot of noise,ep092
1194,that can hear construction you said this,ep092
1197,was a quiet neighborhood it is how life,ep092
1200,is very quiet this is gonna be forever,ep092
1203,yeah I really want to stay in hell,ep092
1206,poblano because I don't see any cafes I,ep092
1209,don't see any restaurants I can't walk,ep092
1212,to anywhere around here yeah but he used,ep092
1215,to live here and this is a good,ep092
1218,neighborhood,ep092
1221,before yes oh I think this is a deal,ep092
1224,breaker for me that's that's pretty far,ep092
1227,away yeah Jared city center or Kelly's,ep092
1230,tranquil views what about having all the,ep092
1233,restaurants bars cafes right there ten,ep092
1236,feet from our doorstep I know but that,ep092
1239,also means a lot of noise a lot of,ep092
1242,traffic I don't know is it what I,ep092
1245,remembered a lot better I can see myself,ep092
1248,taking a daily walk here every day,ep092
1251,Kelly is bringing her husband Jared home,ep092
1254,to meta-gene Columbia after a decade in,ep092
1257,the States but meta-gene is a,ep092
1260,transformed place and she's is bowled,ep092
1263,over by the property choices as he is,ep092
1266,it's very amazing because they serious,ep092
1269,growing the country is improving and now,ep092
1272,we're coming back I know we can have,ep092
1275,something safe something's more than I,ep092
1278,want to find something quiet because Mel,ep092
1281,Jean is a very noisy city I've never,ep092
1284,been to the city and I respect the way,ep092
1287,she feels so even if I want to be in the,ep092
1290,heart of the action,ep092
1293,I want to be able to transition as easy,ep092
1296,as possible I know that what's important,ep092
1299,to her it's very important for me too so,ep092
1302,I think we just keep it simple and hope,ep092
1305,for the best,ep092
1308,so what if ballot Hardeen,ep092
1311,they had the funky floor the traditional,ep092
1314,floor yeah and the columns that were,ep092
1317,kind of spread out through there the,ep092
1320,structural things but the kitchen is,ep092
1323,Betty open also but it also had three,ep092
1326,bedrooms which is great yeah and 360,ep092
1329,bill yep,ep092
1332,the views are good had views from every,ep092

1341,location yeah that one had really good,ep092
1344,furnishings it only had two bedrooms but,ep092
1347,they were big and then the master,ep092
1350,bathroom was awesome oh yeah,ep092

1356,I like a very open Bryce it's a big,ep092
1359,kitchen oh yes,ep092
1362,and at the view yes but it's so far away,ep092
1365,from the city,ep092
1368,we got great properties this is this is,ep092
1371,gonna be very hard,ep092
1374,[Music],ep092
1377,oh if we had eliminate one I think we,ep092
1380,got eliminate Hardeen,ep092
1383,yes bid your head then because I cannot,ep092
1386,live with those Lords yeah okay,ep092
1389,eliminate Hardeen,ep092
1392,well my eyes I cannot believe those,ep092
1395,views but I feel like I'm looking at the,ep092
1398,city from outside I don't feel like I'm,ep092
1401,in the city where I want to be but we,ep092
1404,can't just take the car and go to all,ep092
1407,the restaurants and shops and you have,ep092
1410,three bedrooms for your family when they,ep092
1413,come over yeah but those are three small,ep092
1416,bedrooms I Monticello has big bedrooms,ep092
1419,and it's got that great huge bathroom,ep092
1422,double vanity double shower oh yes I,ep092
1425,know the bathroom is great but still,ep092
1428,it's in the heart of managed English a,ep092
1431,lot of noise a lot of traffic Lucy,ep092
1434,doesn't have that beer we were looking,ep092
1437,for I don't know Marat does have the,ep092
1440,most spectacular view in all the city,ep092
1443,that's what you really wanted,ep092
1446,yeah that's really nice for going over,ep092
1449,well I know you're gonna help me and,ep092

1476,more relaxing again which is gracias,ep092
1479,coming back and having all my family be,ep092
1482,here and I can see them all the time,ep092
1485,it's so good I felt like that house is,ep092
1488,more peaceful than anything yeah,ep092
1491,even though we can't use the bathroom,ep092
1494,together oh my god we don't spend much,ep092
1497,time in the bathroom yes we spend a lot,ep092
1500,more time looking at the view coming,ep092
1503,back I see my country doing well and I,ep092
1506,never imagined what all this was going,ep092
1509,to happen it's so good,ep092
1512,you,ep092
12,ginger I'm not the normal accountant I,ep093
15,cannot be in a cubicle I need to fight,ep093
18,Mike wants to break free in Quito,ep093
21,Ecuador dungeon yeah,ep093
24,whoa but the trick will be keeping him,ep093
27,grounded I'm looking for something,ep093
30,historic with character but inside,ep093
33,modern appliances with Nico so I want,ep093
36,that yeah I don't know if Mike knows,ep093
39,what he wants I kind of looks like I'm,ep093
42,living in grandma's house but I will,ep093
45,support him 100% now why does that look,ep093
48,so natural to me come on Richard we're,ep093
51,just friends yeah I don't hear,ep093
54,[Music],ep093
57,Michael Miguel checking in welcome sir,ep093
60,thank you how are you muy bien class yes,ep093
63,my profession is very boring I'm an,ep093
66,accountant but I choose to make my life,ep093
69,exciting that's yes,ep093
72,what's your was stopped living in,ep093
75,Fullerton California I feel are the big,ep093
78,corporate bubble so last year I came to,ep093
81,Ecuador as a rainforest volunteer and I,ep093
84,knew this is totally different so I,ep093
87,thought I cannot be in a cubicle I'm a,ep093
90,peacock I got a flight Ecuador is an,ep093
93,adventure country it has the rainforest,ep093
96,I could go to the beach I could go to,ep093
99,the Andes the Galapagos Island it's,ep093
102,amazing and Ketones basically it's a,ep093
105,capital it's a hub so once I figured out,ep093
108,how to do my business remotely I figured,ep093
111,hey I could do right from there so,ep093
114,moving to Ecuador just me and my dog,ep093
117,ginger a lot of people would even dream,ep093
120,about that moving to a different country,ep093
123,on my own it's a big step I'm terrified,ep093
126,but I'm doing it oh my god,ep093
129,last year when I was in Quito I met,ep093
132,raylene which coincidentally she was an,ep093
135,accountant living in Quito already so as,ep093
138,soon as I figured out she was doing it I,ep093
141,really pushed myself to live my dream,ep093
144,that she was already living did you know,ep093
147,this was gingers first flight already,ep093
150,let me tell you that was an adventure,ep093
153,just makes full of energy he likes to,ep093
156,take risks and I think him moving to,ep093
159,Ecuador is really important for him this,ep093
162,is a move that he needs to make but I,ep093
165,think a lot of expats come to Ecuador,ep093
168,and expect everything to be really cheap,ep093
171,and some things are but it's a different,ep093
174,way of living properties are different,ep093
177,here so I think he's in for a reality,ep093
180,check the weather changes every half an,ep093
183,hour in Quito,ep093
186,that's what I know this is hot then it's,ep093
189,cold then it's hot again,ep093
192,Akito is a very upbeat city a lot of,ep093
195,young people like to come here because,ep093
198,of that and so the rental market has,ep093
201,increased making it difficult to find,ep093
204,what you want in the city well what,ep093
207,exactly are you looking for in a rental,ep093
210,here in Quito I'm looking for a,ep093
213,three-bedroom two-bath mm-hmm I have a,ep093
216,large chocolate Labrador so I need,ep093
219,something pet friendly and I want to be,ep093
222,close to like the city center so we're,ep093
225,the nightlife is happening already what,ep093
228,else I also would like of you that would,ep093
231,be really nice Kito's known so you have,ep093
234,beautiful views so I want a view oh I,ep093
237,need modern amenities because I recently,ep093
240,started cooking so but I don't want,ep093
243,something American I want something,ep093
246,historic more Ecuadorian colonial style,ep093
249,or correct colonial something historic,ep093
252,with character but inside modern,ep093
255,appliances with an SEM so I want that,ep093
258,yeah that's gonna be really difficult to,ep093
261,find right well there are a colonial,ep093
264,apartments out there but it comes out of,ep093
267,price well my budget is a thousand,ep093
270,dollars so the budget is not a problem,ep093
273,for me well I got to tell you it's it's,ep093
276,tough I think raelia pretty much knows,ep093
279,the cost of things both inside and,ep093
282,outside the city so with Railly involved,ep093
285,michael has a much better chance of,ep093
288,deciding what's most important to him,ep093
291,maybe it the two or three most important,ep093
294,things to him because he's really asking,ep093
297,for a lot and he won't get it all we're,ep093
300,at right now is a two-bedroom two-bath,ep093
303,lovely apartment and it's $800 per month,ep093
306,all right,ep093
309,hello two bedrooms and it's kind of out,ep093
312,of the center of town,ep093
315,it's $200 less in price that's a lot of,ep093
318,money all right let's check it out okay,ep093
321,come on Wow look at the view this is the,ep093
324,view I was expecting good good I like to,ep093
327,hear that I like this and that nice I,ep093
330,like how it's open nice and spacious,ep093
333,yeah so I could cook entertain,ep093
336,make drinks and look there's a full-size,ep093
339,fridge and freezer what that means I'm,ep093
342,gonna be cooking a lot and you're gonna,ep093
345,be coming over all the time to now,ep093
348,absolutely it's good space it has a nice,ep093
351,view but I feel like it's not South,ep093
354,America it's too modern this is the,ep093
357,master bedroom,ep093
360,oh good size wow that's really bright,ep093
363,mm-hmm it's modern not colonial that I'm,ep093
366,looking for yeah it's very wait there's,ep093
369,not much character but you could,ep093
372,decorate it that's true the bed's big,ep093
375,like that mm-hmm I don't like that the,ep093
378,neighbors are directly I could see them,ep093
381,directly hmm well it comes with blackout,ep093
384,shades and curtains but that's the,ep093
387,problem about living in a big city yeah,ep093
390,that's true,ep093
393,let's do the guest bedroom remember it,ep093
396,is the guest bedroom this is really,ep093
399,small I don't know if I would be happy,ep093
402,to have my guests over here it's really,ep093
405,small,ep093
408,the bed is tiny that's for a child and,ep093
411,what about my office well we'd have to,ep093
414,get a small desk and put it over in the,ep093
417,corner or something like that mm-hmm,ep093
420,it's gonna feel like I'm back in a,ep093
423,cubicle I'm trying to escape corporate,ep093
426,America you're putting me back in the,ep093
429,box yeah well what do you think about,ep093
432,the place I do like the layout how it's,ep093
435,open and I do love the view don't get me,ep093
438,wrong,ep093
441,davin you that's a million-dollar view,ep093
444,right there but I don't like how it's so,ep093
447,modern remember I'm looking for it alone,ep093
450,yeah I feel like I'm in Fullerton over,ep093
453,here boom I for eight hundred dollars,ep093
456,for something like this this is a great,ep093
459,deal but I could get this in Fullerton,ep093
462,not for that price I'd give you that but,ep093
465,I don't know Richard so you really want,ep093
468,the full colonial home I want the full,ep093
471,experience okay I think this is a really,ep093
474,good space especially for properties in,ep093
477,quito and I think Mike needs to learn,ep093
480,that he's not gonna be able to have,ep093
483,everything whoa pretty nice huh this is,ep093
486,really nice Richard luxury awaits,ep093
489,but it's out of the way well it depends,ep093
492,on traffic it could be an hour to an,ep093
495,hour-and-a-half from town ooh I don't,ep093
498,know about that but I like this type of,ep093
501,property I feel like I'm almost living,ep093
504,in a mansion hey so I really wanted to,ep093
507,show you this bar it's really cool,ep093
510,awesome Mike is trading the confined,ep093
513,corporate lifestyle of Southern,ep093
516,California for adventurous Quito Ecuador,ep093
519,but as his friend raylene knows it's a,ep093
522,big lead most of my family and friends,ep093
525,are in Fullerton California so moving,ep093
528,away from there is a concern it's I'm,ep093
531,nervous,ep093
534,hey how's it going guys Mike he's just,ep093
537,money Mike nice to meet you man he chose,ep093
540,two big cities it's a cosmopolitan and I,ep093
543,want him to be comfortable and I want,ep093
546,him to enjoy his time here this is our,ep093
549,banana blonde beer here you go,ep093
552,and it's one of our best sellers is kind,ep093
555,of a Hefeweizen but the banana is,ep093
558,something very representative of Ecuador,ep093
561,I can't believe I'm having banana with,ep093
564,the beer would never mix that yeah we do,ep093
567,moving to a different country is,ep093
570,terrifying but I have a motto the ship,ep093
573,and harbor is safe hey that's not what,ep093
576,ships are built for all right let's see,ep093
579,what's inside come on up,ep093
582,Richard was also interested in helping,ep093
585,Mike acclimate with something familiar I,ep093
588,like this and that nice I like how it's,ep093
591,open nice and spacious yeah it's like a,ep093
594,cook entertain but it may have felt a,ep093
597,little too familiar I don't like how,ep093
600,it's so modern remember I'm looking for,ep093
603,alone young this is something I could,ep093
606,get him Fullerton okay raylene and,ep093
609,Richard both know that Mike's massive,ep093
612,wish list will be hard to fulfill so,ep093
615,Richard decides to trade modern features,ep093
618,and downtown access for the classic,ep093
621,Ecuadorian style Mike's been craving but,ep093
624,its way out of town,ep093
627,whoa pretty nice huh this is really nice,ep093
630,Richard we're in Bali Delos chills which,ep093
633,is outside of town little ways but I,ep093
636,think it's worth it it's a very nice,ep093
639,very well-appointed three-bedroom and,ep093
642,"its 1,100 per month it's over your",ep093
645,budget it is over budget but look at the,ep093
648,size how far is it from town well,ep093
651,depends on,ep093
654,it could be an hour to an hour and a,ep093
657,half from town ooh that means they have,ep093
660,to get a car or taxis or taxi yeah I,ep093
663,don't know about that but still the size,ep093
666,I I like it let's check it out,ep093
669,all right Wow,ep093
672,it miss nice it's really Orange,ep093
675,it's very orange it makes me feel like,ep093
678,I'm gonna get a ten well you know that,ep093
681,really is one of the predominant colors,ep093
684,here especially in rentals because it,ep093
687,doesn't show the dirt it is bright,ep093
690,really very spacious I like that the,ep093
693,furniture looks kind of dated though I,ep093
696,kind of looks like I'm living in,ep093
699,grandma's house yes pretty typical,ep093
702,Ecuadorean actually it's easy to tell,ep093
705,when Raeleen doesn't like something I,ep093
708,just forget her face she does not have a,ep093
711,poker face but I kind of like this type,ep093
714,of property I feel like I'm almost,ep093
717,living in a mansion the master bedroom,ep093
720,it's different and I feel like I'm in an,ep093
723,aquarium actually well it's it's really,ep093
726,blue it's blue you know it's not not,ep093
729,blue it's blue Richard probably should,ep093
732,make this place because it's huge a,ep093
735,spacious is really well manicured but I,ep093
738,think it's not the lifestyle man he's,ep093
741,looking for,ep093
744,[Music],ep093
747,of course your kitchen hmm this is huge,ep093
750,in it it has a five-burner stove a nice,ep093
753,Corian sink and faucet this is a modern,ep093
756,kitchen that you asked for,ep093
759,I wouldn't say modern it reminds me of,ep093
762,country Bear Jamboree you know it's all,ep093
765,real natural wood it has a dishwasher,ep093
768,95% of the homes here you will not see a,ep093
771,dishwasher this is a high-end kitchen,ep093
774,trust me if you're cooking and you're,ep093
777,having friends over the party is always,ep093
780,in the kitchen I really do want to start,ep093
783,cooking for myself and I can really see,ep093
786,myself with all this space having large,ep093
789,parties and it's super fancy because I,ep093
792,don't know if this is the spot for me,ep093
795,what do you think raylene I think you'd,ep093
798,be lonely here it's really far from town,ep093
801,it's a really big space it's not a,ep093
804,bachelor pad yeah what are the girls in,ep093
807,the thing yeah this your grandma's house,ep093
810,is she in the back well you're right I,ep093
813,mean I showed you a nice big spacious,ep093
816,home at some point you've got to make,ep093
819,your own mind on the certain items that,ep093
822,you want the most,ep093
825,this is what I'm looking for this is,ep093
828,real Ecuador this is the colonial,ep093
831,section of the city you really like this,ep093
834,to get the access Mike needs and the,ep093
837,style he wants Richard will have to get,ep093
840,creative this is different with his,ep093
843,friend rayleen's help Mike is taking a,ep093
846,big step outside of his comfortable,ep093
849,corporate shell and starting fresh in,ep093
852,Quito Ecuador from California to Quito,ep093
855,it's quite a distance so the biggest,ep093
858,risk is leaving that comfort zone that's,ep093
861,a big thing for me remains an accountant,ep093
864,just like me but she's not the normal,ep093
867,accountant she's an adventure seeker she,ep093
870,was a rough NIC and an oil rig before,ep093
873,but after every poll there's a little,ep093
876,bump I don't like that all right,ep093
879,she's more grounded and she's more,ep093
882,realistic Bama dreamer and even if I'm,ep093
885,terrified no one gonna be trying to,ep093
888,knock me down from the clouds so if you,ep093
891,look over there you should be able to,ep093
894,see Cayambe which is one of the,ep093
897,volcanoes around Quito and I think we're,ep093
900,gonna get to the talk will be able to,ep093
903,see cotopaxi oh cool I love living here,ep093
906,I love Ecuador but there's a huge,ep093
909,difference between being on vacation and,ep093
912,actually moving somewhere and for Mike,ep093
915,who wants it all those differences are,ep093
918,becoming clear Wow look at that view,ep093
921,so far the hunts been a contest between,ep093
924,contemporary and classical I don't like,ep093
927,how it's so modern I feel like I'm in,ep093
930,Fullerton over here so you really want,ep093
933,the full colonial home I want the full,ep093
936,experience whoa pretty nice huh I feel,ep093
939,like I'm an imagined the furniture looks,ep093
942,kind of dated though kind of looks like,ep093
945,I'm living in grandma's house and I,ep093
948,think you'd be lonely here it's really,ep093
951,far from town,ep093
954,really big space it's not a bachelor pad,ep093
957,I think after this mike is really,ep093
960,starting to think differently about what,ep093
963,he wants what he can afford where he has,ep093
966,to go to get it I think it's really,ep093
969,getting confused so I have to,ep093
972,concentrate on getting colonial styling,ep093
975,and at least a two-bedroom home but back,ep093
978,in town this is what I'm looking for,ep093
981,this is real Ecuador this is the,ep093
984,colonial section of the city you really,ep093
987,like this you're about eight blocks off,ep093
990,of city centre the apartments two,ep093
993,bedrooms two baths and it's 950 a month,ep093
996,how does that sound,ep093
999,it's under budget but the street is,ep093
1002,really busy and there's a lot of hills,ep093
1005,yes but its colonial I love the location,ep093
1008,this is different mm-hmm dungeon yeah it,ep093
1011,is spacious but it looks really cold and,ep093
1014,really down this was built in 1890 and,ep093
1017,it's about 127 years old is it haunted I,ep093
1020,don't know I don't know I guess you'll,ep093
1023,have to stay here and find out it's a,ep093
1026,thin budget it isn't ready yet,ep093
1029,it has character and you know I'm a,ep093
1032,character here's your kitchen I could,ep093
1035,get used to this you got the microwave,ep093
1038,you got the oven you got the,ep093
1041,refrigerator this is a beer fridge well,ep093
1044,I didn't say it was a big fridge I'm,ep093
1047,trying to learn how to cook but I don't,ep093
1050,really see myself becoming a master chef,ep093
1053,in this kitchen I'll be a master chef,ep093
1056,for ramen noodles and a beer connoisseur,ep093
1059,connoisseur here's the master bedroom,ep093
1062,I like the style this is like real,ep093
1065,Ecuador I'm not convinced I think it's,ep093
1068,old there's no closet space that bed,ep093
1071,doesn't look very comfy,ep093
1074,No,ep093
1077,now why does that look so natural to me,ep093
1080,come on lovebirds let's go check out the,ep093
1083,other business Richard were just friends,ep093
1086,yeah I don't here this is a guest,ep093
1089,bedroom and this actually looks really,ep093
1092,cool if I had a guest over here and,ep093
1095,they're getting the whole Ecuadorian,ep093
1098,experience there's no windows in here no,ep093
1101,windows s that's correct,ep093
1104,but the guests have their own restroom,ep093
1107,that's a plus that's a huge plus yeah I,ep093
1110,don't know if Mike knows what he wants,ep093
1113,if he absolutely loves this place I will,ep093
1116,support him 100% I just might not visit,ep093
1119,him I like it has texture has character,ep093
1122,I feel like I'm in a different country,ep093
1125,you and that's what I'm looking for,ep093
1128,something different I think it's,ep093
1131,definitely different but to me it's cold,ep093
1134,it's damp,ep093
1137,I don't feel warm and happy in here you,ep093
1140,don't like the cold damp feeling yeah I,ep093
1143,like it Richard I think this is like the,ep093
1146,ultimate man cave yeah there you go see,ep093
1149,I'm waiting to see the ghosts I think,ep093
1152,because there's so much that he wants,ep093
1155,Michael in the end is gonna have to,ep093
1158,compromise on some of his issues so he,ep093
1161,needs to really sit down with raylene,ep093
1164,and talk about what's most important to,ep093
1167,him and what he's really looking for,ep093
1170,can't you imagine having parties in the,ep093
1173,penthouse with a view of the city I,ep093
1176,don't think you can beat that in my,ep093
1179,opinion is that they're living in a,ep093
1182,basement or living on top of the world,ep093
1185,so do you want to go through some,ep093
1188,Ecuadorian high tea mmm high tea what is,ep093
1191,that come on all right,ep093
1194,Mike wasn't buying the dull corporate,ep093
1197,life he was living in California so he's,ep093
1200,decided to give it all up for Quito,ep093
1203,Ecuador moving to Ecuador,ep093
1206,just me and my dog ginger doing it my,ep093
1209,way a lot of people would even dream,ep093
1212,about that his friend raylene has lived,ep093
1215,here for over a year and is trying to,ep093
1218,keep him on a sensible path to a happy,ep093
1221,home,ep093
1224,but even she still has a few things to,ep093
1227,learn like your opinion about houses so,ep093
1230,the modern apartment has everything in,ep093
1233,it and had a brand-new kitchen and the,ep093
1236,views amazing yeah but it wasn't colonia,ep093
1239,and it wasn't in central historical,ep093
1242,that's what I wanted that's true let's,ep093
1245,talk about the suburban house it was,ep093
1248,very spacious and had a big kitchen,ep093
1251,however it's $100 over budget and it's,ep093
1254,really really far from town yeah that's,ep093
1257,true that wasn't my style what about the,ep093
1260,colonial oh it's close to the center of,ep093
1263,town it has the whole colonial feel and,ep093
1266,it's under budget but the kitchen was,ep093
1269,tiny it was basically two hot plates in,ep093
1272,a beer fridge yeah that's true,ep093
1275,and it was in the basement at Star I was,ep093
1278,expecting to see a ghost walk out of the,ep093
1281,guest bedroom,ep093
1284,I think the suburban house should be off,ep093
1287,the list I totally agree with that,ep093
1290,you know the first thing of real estate,ep093
1293,is location and that place is just way,ep093
1296,too far and it's a hundred dollars over,ep093
1299,budget I agree with that is definitely a,ep093
1302,no-go so it's between the modern,ep093
1305,apartment and the dungeon and how you,ep093
1308,means the Ottoman Medicaid yeah what,ep093
1311,about it that case was awesome it's in,ep093
1314,central historical that's where I want,ep093
1317,to be and when you walk in it was just a,ep093
1320,cool feeling it's so different it is,ep093
1323,different it's the difference between,ep093
1326,living in a dungeon or living in the,ep093
1329,clouds Wow,ep093
1332,okay so why are you such a big fan of,ep093
1335,the modern apartment I really like that,ep093
1338,one I think the kitchen was modern the,ep093
1341,master bedroom was huge in the view was,ep093
1344,incredible but look at the guest bedroom,ep093
1347,that's a tiny room but in the colonial,ep093
1350,that guest room had a big bed it was,ep093
1353,very authentic so when my guests come,ep093
1356,they're actually getting the whole,ep093
1359,Ecuadorian feel that's true,ep093
1362,but if I was your guest and I stayed in,ep093
1365,the room with no windows I'd feel like,ep093
1368,I'm in solitary confinement not on,ep093
1371,holiday ooh,ep093
1374,okay well can't you imagine having,ep093
1377,parties in the penthouse of the view of,ep093
1380,the city I don't think you can beat that,ep093
1383,in my opinion inside they're living in a,ep093
1386,dungeon or living on top of the world,ep093
1389,you know what really Nia I think you're,ep093
1392,right I think you're right,ep093
1395,modern apartment it is thanks for Dean,ep093
1398,good choice wow this is amazing,ep093
1401,every time I come up here I forget how,ep093
1404,beautiful it is it's a gorgeous view I,ep093
1407,love it if I could describe my life now,ep093
1410,in one word my life is awesome this is,ep093
1413,just such an awesome country you know,ep093
1416,what like the snoer I enjoyed my work,ep093
1419,and overall I'm Way happier,ep093
1422,that's way too high I know I gave up my,ep093
1425,ultimate man cave but I'm saving more,ep093
1428,money being here because I have a,ep093
1431,kitchen and I'm becoming a good cook my,ep093
1434,food comes out good and with that extra,ep093
1437,money ginger and I work traveling we're,ep093
1440,checking out Ecuador oh it's amazing I,ep093
1443,love it,ep093
1446,Brittany was right about everything,ep093
1449,really I were becoming better and better,ep093
1452,friends you gotta challenge yourself you,ep093
1455,gotta get out I did it it was a hard,ep093
1458,decision it was not easy to do but I,ep093
1461,have no regrets I've made the best,ep093
1464,decision in my life I'm really glad I,ep093
1467,did this,ep093
1470,[Music],ep093
12,[Music],ep094
15,Janey's put her nursing career on hold,ep094
18,who's the king of the goats I'm the king,ep094
21,of accounts so that Ryan can pursue a,ep094
24,job opportunity with the military in,ep094
27,Germany she's focused on what's best for,ep094
30,the family I am so exhausted and I don't,ep094
33,think Ryan really understands that,ep094
36,Ryan's wrapped up in the details it's,ep094
39,modern it's really clean it's what I,ep094
42,like I want a house that's close to the,ep094
45,city where the kids can experience the,ep094
48,culture what I want is to have enough,ep094
51,room for the kids to get out of the,ep094
54,house and out of my hair I think they,ep094
57,will drive me a little bit crazy,ep094
60,Oh 1 Acre,ep094
63,here who's gonna take care of that,ep094
66,[Music],ep094
69,Germany I'm in Healthcare Administration,ep094
72,when a job came open in launch tool,ep094
75,Germany to work at an Army Hospital I,ep094
78,was really excited to have that,ep094
81,opportunity are you guys hungry for a,ep094
84,pretzel yeah the kids are at the right,ep094
87,age we can pull them out of school and,ep094
90,they're just like sponges they just,ep094
93,absorb everything and there's so much to,ep094
96,experience we kind of coaxed him by,ep094
99,saying there were pretzels here you guys,ep094
102,know the word for dinosaur in German no,ep094
105,nope I'm a nurse practitioner and the,ep094
108,longer I am away from the states I could,ep094
111,lose my license and so that's a big,ep094
114,concern of mine she's trading in a,ep094
117,career she loves for a new unpaid,ep094
120,position as a stay-at-home mom and it's,ep094
123,gonna take a little getting used to with,ep094
126,three children cooped up in the house,ep094
129,everyone is at each other's throats,ep094
132,he's uprooted us from our home so,ep094
135,hopefully he's feeling a little guilty,ep094
138,and for my sanity he'll give in to some,ep094
141,of my needs one thing I thought would be,ep094
144,great for the kids is living in the,ep094
147,center and cosmos garden it's just,ep094
150,amazing that there's so much history and,ep094
153,culture and wonderful things to do we,ep094
156,need our kids to speak German so that,ep094
159,they can translate for us Louden it's,ep094
162,really very nice city it's having a lot,ep094
165,of activity for the kids we have a lot,ep094
168,of history here we have Emperor's Palace,ep094
171,en Casas Louden we have nice old castle,ep094
174,ruins so it's a lot to see here the real,ep094
177,estate market it's not that easy because,ep094
180,we have the biggest military base,ep094
183,outside of America with all those,ep094
186,Americans bowing and coming the houses,ep094
189,are gone very fast so what is your,ep094
192,"budget $2,200 per month would be our",ep094
195,limit we would like a four-bedroom house,ep094
198,with three bathrooms and a big kitchen,ep094
201,I'd like a modern house I wouldn't,ep094
204,for a traditional house something in the,ep094
207,countryside close to nature the green,ep094
210,and the beauty and the outdoors and I,ep094
213,want my kids to experience that also I'd,ep094
216,really like a yard to get the kids out,ep094
219,of my hair it's a big yard big yard but,ep094
222,not too big of a yard or not too country,ep094
225,because I don't want to spend my whole,ep094
228,time like doing yard work but I'd love,ep094
231,to have a home that's near the city so,ep094
234,we can enjoy what a city has to offer,ep094
237,for the kids where they could experience,ep094
240,the culture and not just be out in a,ep094
243,field or something you both I completely,ep094
246,the opposite Ryan and Kenny I think they,ep094
249,will drive me a little bit crazy they,ep094
252,may have a diverse wish list but,ep094
255,christina has to start somewhere so she,ep094
258,gets things going close to town for Ryan,ep094
261,we are here in other burg it's a really,ep094
264,nice town very family friendly,ep094
267,neighborhood really perfect location for,ep094
270,you,ep094
273,what about bedrooms and bathrooms four,ep094
276,bedrooms three bathrooms how far is it,ep094
279,from the city around ten minutes drive,ep094
282,oh I like that that's good for you,ep094
285,what's the price on this it's right on,ep094
288,"your budget $2,200 a month oh yeah it's",ep094
291,the top of our budget but you have to,ep094
294,trust me it's a great house you have to,ep094
297,see it you will like it okay come on I,ep094
300,love it all the natural light and great,ep094
303,floors,ep094
306,it looks really modern a little too,ep094
309,modern I feel like I could be anywhere,ep094
312,and it has a good view the yard - do you,ep094
315,like to see it yeah,ep094
318,this is nice you know I think it's too,ep094
321,small I got to be honest with you this,ep094
324,is about as big as I want the yard to,ep094
327,get if I'm gonna be the one mowing and,ep094
330,cleaning it,ep094
333,this fountains right in the center of,ep094
336,everything I can see the kids bumping,ep094
339,into this and getting hurt,ep094
342,since I'm home with the kids all day I,ep094
345,really need them to have a space to get,ep094
348,their energy out and I don't think Ryan,ep094
351,really understands that since he's in,ep094
354,the office all day no railings for the,ep094
357,kids that's scary let me talk to the,ep094
360,landlord so you can put some revving up,ep094
363,I think this would be great kids,ep094
366,bathroom it's not my style but I do like,ep094
369,that it has two sinks for the kids to,ep094
372,get ready for school in the morning,ep094
375,there's also a shower so when you have,ep094
378,one child in the bathtub you can put the,ep094
381,other one in the shower so they will get,ep094
384,ready quicker look at this huge bedroom,ep094
387,this is really big you know this would,ep094
390,fit both of the boys yeah this is great,ep094
393,I love the windows and all the light we,ep094
396,usually don't have built-in closets in,ep094
399,Germany so it's a really big big bonus,ep094
402,for you so this could be Tessa suit,ep094
405,bedroom good size very bright I gotta,ep094
408,tell you I really do like this style,ep094
411,this is great and there is another,ep094
414,bedroom with bathroom and you can use it,ep094
417,as a guest bedroom yeah or the boys can,ep094
420,each have their own room look at this,ep094
423,and maybe wow this is great,ep094
426,I love the view out the windows all the,ep094
429,green and trees I'm not crazy about this,ep094
432,side with all the houses I like that,ep094
435,it's modern it's really clean it's what,ep094
438,I like yeah but no railings for the kids,ep094
441,that's really dangerous this house it's,ep094
444,gonna make daily life difficult I'm,ep094
447,getting a little bit frustrated that,ep094
450,we're not able to seem to agree on,ep094
453,things the yard seems to be the right,ep094
456,size it's hard to imagine the kids,ep094
459,running around in that backyard but I,ep094
462,can't imagine stretching out inside and,ep094
465,spending a lot of happy time there's a,ep094
468,family really excited about this one I'm,ep094
471,seeing,ep094
474,lots of trees and green for you one acre,ep094
477,that is emanating here who's gonna take,ep094
480,care of that the yard scares me,ep094
483,during the some color words in German do,ep094
486,you know the word for blue yeah Ryan's,ep094
489,new job is shaking things up for the,ep094
492,Lindgren family they're being uprooted,ep094
495,from their home in Washington I'd love,ep094
498,it for the kids to feel comfortable in,ep094
501,their new country learn about the,ep094
504,culture we'd love to learn the language,ep094
507,we'd love to see historic sites you see,ep094
510,any letters or numbers kid a - yes what,ep094
513,else can you see a nine okay and while,ep094
516,Cheney's on board,ep094
519,isn't it funny we came all the way to,ep094
522,Germany to see American painting she's,ep094
525,putting her career on hold I'm a nurse,ep094
528,practitioner and I won't be able to work,ep094
531,well we're here to tackle the equally,ep094
534,foreign task of being a stay-at-home mom,ep094
537,things are a little crazy I am kind of,ep094
540,scrambling with trying to find a grocery,ep094
543,store and find food and get the kids in,ep094
546,school meanwhile Ryan is laser focused,ep094
549,on work my job is to make sure that,ep094
552,hospitals run the way that they should,ep094
555,providing quality care and Cheney fears,ep094
558,that he may not fully understand what,ep094
561,she's up against go towards mama for my,ep094
564,sanity we really need some open space,ep094
567,for them to get their energy out so,ep094
570,here's your yard this is nice you know I,ep094
573,think it's too small I gotta be honest,ep094
576,with you this is about as big as I want,ep094
579,the yard to get if I'm gonna be the one,ep094
582,mowing and cleaning it starting a new,ep094
585,job I don't want to add to my plate,ep094
588,another thing to worry about I can see,ep094
591,the kids bumping into this and getting,ep094
594,hurt it is a little stressful with the,ep094
597,three kids no railings that's really,ep094
600,dangerous and I don't think Ryan really,ep094
603,understands that since he's in the,ep094
606,office all day I love it all the natural,ep094
609,light and great floors,ep094
612,it looks really modern a little too,ep094
615,modern I'm getting a little bit,ep094
618,frustrated that we're not able to seem,ep094
621,to agree on things I will change my,ep094
624,strategy and showed him something the,ep094
627,dryin like very much now I would like to,ep094
630,show Amy something close to green and,ep094
633,forest Christine I'm really excited,ep094
636,about this one I'm seeing lots of trees,ep094
639,and green,ep094
642,I know for you one acre land here who's,ep094
645,gonna take care of that Christina and,ep094
648,I'll mow it yes how far is it from the,ep094
651,city around 20 25 minutes oh that's,ep094
654,pretty far how many bedrooms and,ep094
657,bathrooms five bedrooms two and a half,ep094
660,baths nice kitchen it's under your,ep094
663,"budget $1,900 a month oh that's great",ep094
666,that's great,ep094
669,oh wow I love this view I like it inside,ep094
672,it's modern,ep094
675,yeah a little bit more modern than what,ep094
678,I was hoping for but this view really,ep094
681,makes up for it the floor I'm not big,ep094
684,fan of the laminate I like tile or real,ep094
687,wood but I think you can put a carpet on,ep094
690,it the lender should be okay with this,ep094
693,that's a great stove I love the surfaces,ep094
696,do I push I do like all the cabinet,ep094
699,space I like the tile this would be easy,ep094
702,to clean up when the kids have their,ep094
705,messes it upstairs to the bedrooms,ep094
708,looks like I'll get a workout every time,ep094
711,I go to the bedrooms,ep094
714,house the railings out like that this,ep094
717,room is so big it could be you boys,ep094
720,bedroom gym in here we've got more,ep094
723,laminate I know you don't like that and,ep094
726,just fresh renovated bathroom I like it,ep094
729,it's modern not really my style but it,ep094
732,is a great size I could see getting all,ep094
735,the kids ready in here yeah we could get,ep094
738,them ready like an assembly line good,ep094
741,size of a master bedroom this is a nice,ep094
744,size and there's another bedroom just,ep094
747,crossed the hall could be Tessa's room,ep094
750,good size over room here yeah could be,ep094
753,your office bedroom whatever you want,ep094
756,this would be perfect for a playroom,ep094
759,it's already got shelves we can put all,ep094
762,our toys down here and put the kids in,ep094
765,the room and shut the door I like that,ep094
768,idea what I'm really,ep094
771,to see his backyard this is amazing I,ep094
774,feel like I'm in a Bavarian forest it's,ep094
777,really big,ep094
780,I will help you with the mowing and hey,ep094
783,I told you if you are calling me I will,ep094
786,come really yeah no I'm kidding,ep094
789,overall what do you think this is just,ep094
792,great,ep094
795,it has more bedrooms than what we asked,ep094
798,for and it's under budget yeah it had a,ep094
801,lot of space inside it has a huge yard I,ep094
804,do worry that this is too much for us to,ep094
807,take care of but honey it's exactly like,ep094
810,what I wanted but with three kids I want,ep094
813,to have a house that's closer to the,ep094
816,city where there's plenty of stuff for,ep094
819,them to do no way not me it makes me,ep094
822,feel a little bit worried that maybe the,ep094
825,houses and everything that I want when,ep094
828,it's so much the chi-lites cheese,ep094
831,country and I'm rock and roll oh my god,ep094
834,so this could be your kids bathroom I,ep094
837,like it it's a nice size why are there,ep094
840,two toilets putting events in the day he,ep094
843,doesn't get around,ep094
846,[Music],ep094
849,are you guys ready to go to the zoo yeah,ep094
852,a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity for,ep094
855,Ryan he's bringing his family to Germany,ep094
858,we're coming from Lacey Washington just,ep094
861,outside of Olympia and it was green and,ep094
864,beautiful we just love getting out in,ep094
867,nature so as hard as it is to leave,ep094
870,we're so excited to go to Germany,ep094
873,there's lots of fun stuff to do in,ep094
876,Germany huh I would love for the kids to,ep094
879,go to a German school and learn German,ep094
882,the alles asking you there bist du we,ep094
885,want him to get immersed in the culture,ep094
888,she's stronger for it,ep094
891,yeah you are pretty,ep094
894,but for Chaney transitioning to a,ep094
897,stay-at-home mom is more of a foreign,ep094
900,concept than the change in country I'm,ep094
903,the king of the Goths come on down guys,ep094
906,with three children they can sometimes,ep094
909,go crazy it's gonna be a lot for me you,ep094
912,know I'll be spending more time at work,ep094
915,and worrying about my job he knows what,ep094
918,he wants I like that it's modern it's,ep094
921,really clean it's what I like but he,ep094
924,also knows what I want and I think that,ep094
927,sometimes is more important to small for,ep094
930,the yard I feel like it's not in the,ep094
933,country they are a completely opposite I,ep094
936,want a house that's close to the city,ep094
939,where the kids can experience the,ep094
942,culture and not just be out in a field,ep094
945,or something I disagree babe my idea of,ep094
948,a backyard is to have enough room for,ep094
951,the kids to get out of my hair an acre,ep094
954,who's gonna mow that Christina and I'll,ep094
957,mow it the yard scares me they are,ep094
960,really driving me crazy,ep094
963,because it's only something that one of,ep094
966,them didn't like I was trying to find,ep094
969,something that has a little bit for Ryan,ep094
972,and something for Cheney so they can,ep094
975,both be happy,ep094
978,this house it's a really good compromise,ep094
981,house we're in a quiet nice village it,ep094
984,looks like we're kind of in the suburbs,ep094
987,I was hoping for something more country,ep094
990,we are country this is a typical German,ep094
993,neighborhood,ep094
996,very nice for your kids how far is it,ep094
999,from the city around 20 25 minutes,ep094
1002,that's pretty far but Ryan you will love,ep094
1005,me the yard is really nice but it's not,ep094
1008,too big so you will not have to mall the,ep094
1011,whole day this house has four bedrooms,ep094
1014,"three bathrooms it's $1,700 per month Oh",ep094
1017,God under budget,ep094
1020,let's look awesome yeah,ep094
1023,wow it's really nice a lot of natural,ep094
1026,light yeah open floor plan I really like,ep094
1029,that there's enough room for a formal,ep094
1032,dining room and the living room oh this,ep094
1035,is a great space I could be in here,ep094
1038,cooking and I could see the kids from,ep094
1041,anywhere let's go upstairs to see the,ep094
1044,bedrooms so this is the first bedroom,ep094
1047,yeah this is a good-size room I like the,ep094
1050,closets they have two additional,ep094
1053,bedrooms on this floor and they are,ep094
1056,exactly the same size so you have plenty,ep094
1059,of room for all your kids it's great so,ep094
1062,this could be your kids bathroom I like,ep094
1065,it it's a nice size why are there two,ep094
1068,toilets honey that's a bidet I like the,ep094
1071,size of the tub it will make the bath,ep094
1074,time very easy with the kids huh this is,ep094
1077,really great look at this room oh wow,ep094
1080,this is huge I really like this yeah,ep094
1083,that's great space but we're on a,ep094
1086,separate floor from the kids yeah I,ep094
1089,don't like being away from the kids I,ep094
1092,want to all be together they're still so,ep094
1095,little mommy and daddy might need their,ep094
1098,own space to about to look at this,ep094
1101,bathroom all the bathrooms in this house,ep094
1104,are huge when we are talking about space,ep094
1107,I would relish love to show you the,ep094
1110,backyard so this is another reason why I,ep094
1113,brought you to this home this very nice,ep094
1116,backyard it seems like just the right,ep094
1119,size I think it's not very big and,ep094
1122,there's Hots of houses I feel a little,ep094
1125,closed,ep094
1128,I was just really hoping for trees and,ep094
1131,big spaces and this isn't really what I,ep094
1134,was picturing I like the modern inside,ep094
1137,of this house and the yard is a perfect,ep094
1140,size the only thing that really worries,ep094
1143,me is how far it is from the city I,ep094
1146,really like the nice kitchen,ep094
1149,but as beautiful as that master suite is,ep094
1152,I just worry that the Masters on a,ep094
1155,different floor and I don't want to be,ep094
1158,away from the kids,ep094
1161,[Music],ep094
1164,I think christina is going to lose it if,ep094
1167,we can't get on the same page we can,ep094
1170,compromise and you can think like I did,ep094
1173,who's the king of the goats I'm the king,ep094
1176,of bitch get a position he couldn't,ep094
1179,refuse has brought Ryan and his family,ep094
1182,to Germany see anything if you turn your,ep094
1185,head sideways Janey put her career on,ep094
1188,hold to make the move and is feeling the,ep094
1191,weight of being a stay-at-home mom,ep094
1194,I am so exhausted with these three kids,ep094
1197,and I don't think Ryan really,ep094
1200,understands out since he's in the office,ep094
1203,all day so having a home that relieves,ep094
1206,some of the stress is a must for her for,ep094
1209,my sanity but Ryan doesn't want to be,ep094
1212,left in the dust my family is moving,ep094
1215,here for me and for this job but I will,ep094
1218,say that I want to be happy too,ep094
1221,so ultra-modern house I like the open,ep094
1224,space but you go out into the yard and,ep094
1227,it has a fountain in the middle of it I,ep094
1230,know somebody's gonna get hurt running,ep094
1233,around but that house is closer to the,ep094
1236,city where they could experience the,ep094
1239,culture and not just be out in a field,ep094
1242,but what about those dangerous stairs,ep094
1245,without railings Cristina said that she,ep094
1248,talked to the landlord and put some,ep094
1251,railings up on those but what about the,ep094
1254,country house you know I love that yard,ep094
1257,I can really picture the kids loving it,ep094
1260,and playing a lot out there well but I,ep094
1263,do worry that's too much property for us,ep094
1266,to take care of and I wanted to spend,ep094
1269,our weekends in the city not doing yard,ep094
1272,work all right what did you think about,ep094
1275,the suburban house the yard was a good,ep094
1278,selling point for me so the kids can,ep094
1281,play but we're not gonna spend all of,ep094
1284,our time cleaning it I thought it was a,ep094
1287,little small and it was right up against,ep094
1290,all these other houses and I didn't like,ep094
1293,that the master was on a different floor,ep094
1296,this is gonna be tough,ep094
1299,[Music],ep094
1302,I know christina is trying to find a,ep094
1305,happy medium but the suburban house just,ep094
1308,didn't work,ep094
1311,the Masters on a different floor and I,ep094
1314,don't want to be away from the kids I,ep094
1317,think there's still too young,ep094
1320,yeah the ultra-modern house I liked it,ep094
1323,it did have a lot of open space inside,ep094
1326,and it was modern it was nice I know you,ep094
1329,liked it but overall that place just,ep094
1332,felt cold to me it didn't seem like a,ep094
1335,happy cozy house that I can see our,ep094
1338,family hanging out the country house you,ep094
1341,know I love that yard being surrounded,ep094
1344,by the green trees it is beautiful but,ep094
1347,that's too much yard for us to take care,ep094
1350,of but that would make it easier with,ep094
1353,the kids for me I think you've made it,ep094
1356,pretty clear which one you want and,ep094
1359,you'll be the one that's spending most,ep094
1362,of the time with the kids and I think,ep094
1365,you'll be very happy there so I think,ep094
1368,we're saying the country house yes do,ep094
1371,you like living in Germany we are so,ep094
1374,happy with our decision what's your,ep094
1377,favorite room we love our house and we,ep094
1380,spend a lot of time in the yard our yard,ep094
1383,is bigger than a real soccer field the,ep094
1386,kids are adjusting in a wonderful way,ep094
1389,they're happy in their schools we go who,ep094
1392,else likes cats we're still learning,ep094
1395,German yeah we knew enough not to get,ep094
1398,into major trouble can you guys teach us,ep094
1401,some German words but the kids are just,ep094
1404,absorbing it like a sponge Oh,ep094
1407,is good night how about you see and when,ep094
1410,Tessa gets mad she'll yell na9 you guys,ep094
1413,know German better than mom and dads,ep094
12,[Music],ep095
15,[Applause],ep095
18,Luke and gosh',ep095
21,have big plans for their family in an,ep095
24,out-of-the-way place I mean it's really,ep095
27,off the grand spot we're really just,ep095
30,stuck in a rock they're starting a new,ep095
33,venture in sihanoukville Cambodia,ep095
36,building an island resort your thing,ep095
39,we've done the right thing well it's not,ep095
42,going back now but leaving their modern,ep095
45,lifestyle back in Sydney Australia won't,ep095
48,be easy,ep095
51,do we have a hot water oh no not all the,ep095
54,Western world doesn't exist here,ep095
57,everything is cambodian style cambodia,ep095
60,way and it could even take them off the,ep095
63,grid entirely there's no walls don't,ep095
66,have to worry about snakes coming,ep095
69,through there this is just permanent,ep095
72,camping is a simple bathroom you do your,ep095
75,cuckoo oh yes,ep095
78,I didn't realize life could be that,ep095
81,different,ep095
84,[Music],ep095
87,we're gonna get something for dinner,ep095
90,whoa yeah this only was a bit of culture,ep095
93,shop or we arrived to Cambodia can we,ep095
96,get something else in Sydney we had a,ep095
99,nice big house and here do you see,ep095
102,wooden shacks very different from home,ep095
105,isn't it,ep095
108,I meant gosh I back in Poland and live,ep095
111,for 10 years in Sydney so moving to,ep095
114,Cambodia why not let's do it let's buy,ep095
117,rice here we both worked corporate jobs,ep095
120,and really long hours I'm always working,ep095
123,for someone else we wanted to have our,ep095
126,own thing and manage the time the way,ep095
129,that we like it let's make a sandcastle,ep095
132,no we are building the resort we always,ep095
135,dreamt about it sounds good yeah there's,ep095
138,a great opportunity in sihanoukville,ep095
141,because there's in the whole island,ep095
144,close to the city that it's not very,ep095
147,much developed look there one of our,ep095
150,friends has a hotel or close to Karim,ep095
153,and gave me a call and said hey which,ep095
156,seems like there's a great opportunity,ep095
159,over there put it on that pile over,ep095
162,there okay up until now they've been,ep095
165,"managing the build from afar over 4,000",ep095
168,miles away in Sydney I'm actually,ep095
171,starting to imagine what this has been a,ep095
174,look like but with construction underway,ep095
177,the time feels right to make the move,ep095
180,it's certainly a risk leaving up to good,ep095
183,incomes and at the moment living on well,ep095
186,we're not quite sure everything's going,ep095
189,into funding the resort lot of work,ep095
192,still to do at the end of the day we,ep095
195,didn't want to look back and think all,ep095
198,we've done is work we have an,ep095
201,experienced life and I don't want the,ep095
204,boys to remember growing up and the,ep095
207,parents weren't there we are trying to,ep095
210,find a place now in sihanoukville but,ep095
213,it's over an hour one way come you so,ep095
216,we'll have to have a look what the,ep095
219,options are on the island located on the,ep095
222,southwestern coast of Cambodia,ep095
225,sihanoukville province is home to koh,ep095
228,rong the second largest island in,ep095
231,the developing region shows promise as,ep095
234,an international travel destination,ep095
237,something Luke is banking on to make,ep095
240,their venture success sinner will is,ep095
243,becoming so popular in terms of tourism,ep095
246,and for businessmen because they have,ep095
249,international seaport and Airport it's,ep095
252,very good for logistics how we can help,ep095
255,you I am building a resort on coral,ep095
258,island and we are now looking for a,ep095
261,place for a family my main priority is,ep095
264,three bedrooms and a bit of outdoor,ep095
267,space the boys and that dog is also,ep095
270,coming with us I love a western-style,ep095
273,house with lots of natural light for me,ep095
276,the priority is the budget to stay under,ep095
279,$500 per month and prefer to live on the,ep095
282,island so there is no commute to work,ep095
285,you won't find a Western house on the,ep095
288,island are you prepared to live in a,ep095
291,traditional home yeah I can I would like,ep095
294,to have a look at it for us we are happy,ep095
297,for the simple living I'm not so,ep095
300,enthusiastic about going to simple I,ep095
303,don't think I want to give up all the,ep095
306,luxuries from home so let's see what we,ep095
309,can find,ep095
312,Western amenities are limited on koh,ep095
315,rong island near the site of their new,ep095
318,resort so Saeng kicks things off on the,ep095
321,mainland,ep095
324,knowing the commute by ferry could be an,ep095
327,issue for Luke so how many bedrooms in,ep095
330,this one it's two bedrooms okay so the,ep095
333,boys will have to share how much is it,ep095
336,it's a $600 over the budget so it's nice,ep095
339,it's cute actually,ep095
342,so western-style can we have a look,ep095
345,please yeah please have a look,ep095
348,Wow,ep095
351,I guess it's fairly modern does it come,ep095
354,with the furniture just these okay at,ep095
357,least there's a few things we'd have to,ep095
360,buy an aircon that's the number one,ep095
363,thing yeah but the ceilings like they,ep095
366,got all the leaks and everything are,ep095
369,they gonna fix it oh the owners would,ep095
372,like to rent a city's I guess I will,ep095
375,have to do it myself,ep095
378,yeah I guess that's Cambodia life for,ep095
381,you then,ep095
384,hmm it's not so bright so is this the,ep095
387,bigger bedroom yeah this is a the,ep095
390,biggest bedroom because they will have,ep095
393,to get a second bed,ep095
396,maybe we can if we move the couch and,ep095
399,put single there and the boys can share,ep095
402,this one I like this one looks nice and,ep095
405,clean and the light is pretty good,ep095
408,[Music],ep095
411,dog here that's because of the,ep095
414,protection outside it's making the room,ep095
417,green there's no way of removing that at,ep095
420,all is that I guess you can do something,ep095
423,about it again myself yeah of course of,ep095
426,course you need to do it,ep095
429,Joshua seems to be liking that this,ep095
432,house in western style but it's over the,ep095
435,budget and all those things need to be,ep095
438,fixed so there's an ensuite there's no,ep095
441,windows wow that's really dark in here,ep095
444,very simple with no soulstealer,ep095
447,yeah look at that I guess I say the,ep095
450,exhaust air but it's broken and then the,ep095
453,owner loved it I'll have to fix it,ep095
456,myself again yes I guess so you've got a,ep095
459,lot of work on your plane I think Luke,ep095
462,was just thinking budget it's over,ep095
465,budgets over budget there's nothing to,ep095
468,really think about I was more hopeful we,ep095
471,could definitely work out the schematics,ep095
474,it looked really quite Western yes this,ep095
477,is a kitchen have a look okay there's,ep095
480,not too bad,ep095
483,we got washing machine free so it's two,ep095
486,of the biggest expenses we don't have to,ep095
489,buy well there's no oven,ep095
492,no no away you just need to buy it for,ep095
495,yourself all right,ep095
498,every kitchen I've seen in my lifetime,ep095
501,has an oven it's just there how do they,ep095
504,cook that go over there where does it go,ep095
507,to it's an outside that just you need,ep095
510,backyard no no backyard,ep095
513,nothing real yeah but just be difficult,ep095
516,for the boys and the dog because they,ep095
519,can get a little bit rowdy how much is,ep095
522,it again it's a $600 is that okay with,ep095
525,you my budget was 500 and there's so,ep095
528,many things that I'll need to fix around,ep095
531,here I have a mixed reaction I mean I,ep095
534,like it because overall it's western,ep095
537,style which is what I want it we've got,ep095
540,the mod cons I mean it's not exactly,ep095
543,what I'm used to in Sydney but obviously,ep095
546,I'll have to give up something here at,ep095
549,the end of the day budget is one of the,ep095
552,crucial things and for me it's quite a,ep095
555,long commute and I really wanted to,ep095
558,spend some more time with the family I'm,ep095
561,going to show you a man traditional,ep095
564,house perfect and you will like the,ep095
567,price because it's just $200 per night,ep095
570,that's not the house is it yeah it is,ep095
573,the house no seriously,ep095
576,boys we go into the island today Luke,ep095
579,and gosh',ep095
582,are embarking on the adventure of a,ep095
585,lifetime we're giving up our corporate,ep095
588,lives and our comfortable lifestyle in,ep095
591,Sydney because we want to spend more,ep095
594,time together as a family in Cambodia we,ep095
597,go into the island over there that's,ep095
600,where daddy is working western amenities,ep095
603,on koh rong island are almost,ep095
606,non-existent but the island located off,ep095
609,the country's beautiful southwest coast,ep095
612,offers an intriguing investment,ep095
615,opportunity look at that boys those are,ep095
618,the villas of our resort,ep095
621,one of our friends has a hotel or close,ep095
624,to Karim and gave me a call and said hey,ep095
627,it seems like there's a great,ep095
630,opportunity over there because building,ep095
633,our result somewhere else will cost a,ep095
636,fortune,ep095
639,agent sang has started their house,ep095
642,search on the mainland in sihanoukville,ep095
645,an hour ferry ride from their Island,ep095
648,Resort Seattle View is the closest place,ep095
651,to the island it's nice it's cute,ep095
654,actually,ep095
657,so western stars can we have a look,ep095
660,please yeah please have a look Wow,ep095
663,aircon that's fairly modern the ceilings,ep095
666,are nice and high,ep095
669,have a look okay it's not too bad you,ep095
672,know washing machine free so it's two of,ep095
675,the biggest expenses we don't have to,ep095
678,buy gosh is these potential but there,ep095
681,are big issues for Luke how much is it,ep095
684,again six hundred US dollars is that,ep095
687,okay with you my budget was five hundred,ep095
690,at the end of the day but it is one of,ep095
693,the crucial things and for me it's quite,ep095
696,a long commute spend some time with the,ep095
699,family when I'd really love to live on,ep095
702,the island close to works I don't have,ep095
705,to travel every day this time around,ep095
708,sang gets them on island and under,ep095
711,budget but almost entirely off the grid,ep095
714,I'm going to show you a house a Khmer,ep095
717,traditional house perfect and you we,ep095
720,like the price because it's just 200,ep095
723,rooms it's one bedroom only one how only,ep095
726,one bed we can make another one fix it,ep095
729,okay that's not the house is it yeah it,ep095
732,is the house no seriously no that's too,ep095
735,simple no it's not a house oh it's a,ep095
738,simple living looking at gosh eyes face,ep095
741,I really thought that she might fall and,ep095
744,I'll have to pick up I appreciate the,ep095
747,Cambodians and their local culture but,ep095
750,no school and you know you don't need,ep095
753,the aircon walls there's holes in the,ep095
756,floor do I have to worry about snakes,ep095
759,coming through there oh no not at all,ep095
762,you know we are in the insider village,ep095
765,out of the Chango budget-wise it's,ep095
768,perfect but there's no walls,ep095
771,Luke is really adamant about the budget,ep095
774,but this I don't know how he could even,ep095
777,think about living in this place,ep095
780,I couldn't imagine putting the kids in,ep095
783,there I could definitely see boys loving,ep095
786,it and dog loving it they can spend a,ep095
789,lot of time outdoors running around,ep095
792,that's a simple kitchen and this is the,ep095
795,cast oh so that's the thing,ep095
798,do we have hot water here oh no not at,ep095
801,all this is just permanent camping I'd,ep095
804,like to show you their bedroom,ep095
807,I don't see how a family of four could,ep095
810,fit in here the rest they sleep outside,ep095
813,and they put on it just a mosquito net,ep095
816,there you go you want simple life that's,ep095
819,your bedroom out there I guess this is,ep095
822,living off the grid but there is no,ep095
825,commute for me I can spend more time,ep095
828,with you and kids that's my priority,ep095
831,this is a simple bathroom the bathroom,ep095
834,yeah so no shower no no I'll just use a,ep095
837,big bucket the toilet doesn't flush,ep095
840,either,ep095
843,you just stand up if you do your poopoo,ep095
846,yes,ep095
849,just stand up on that yes and manually,ep095
852,everything is manually so no shower no,ep095
855,hot water only buckets to flush the,ep095
858,toilet get me out of here take me back,ep095
861,to the mainland now no I'm out Luke,ep095
864,sorry but this is $200 it's way below,ep095
867,our budget,ep095
870,I'm a financial risk on the resort,ep095
873,that's quite high so we really have to,ep095
876,be mindful of what we spend budgets,ep095
879,budget but sorry the culture shock is,ep095
882,really sunk in I didn't realize life,ep095
885,could be that different promise that,ep095
888,seven hundred US dollars per month well,ep095
891,saying when we said five hundred yeah,ep095
894,but this house has three bedrooms and,ep095
897,lots of big space outside we've got a,ep095
900,pool that's a nice bonus digital,ep095
903,hi guys honey's get very dancey yes Luke,ep095
906,and gosh',ep095
909,are heading from Sydney Australia to,ep095
912,sihanoukville Cambodia to live a simpler,ep095
915,life with their boys,ep095
918,it's petrifying but we're giving it all,ep095
921,up in come good jobs our nice house,ep095
924,we're gonna try something different for,ep095
927,the benefit of us and the benefit of our,ep095
930,boys and we're not gonna get old and,ep095
933,regret that we didn't do it,ep095
936,[Music],ep095
939,[Applause],ep095
942,[Music],ep095
945,an opportunity to start their own,ep095
948,business is taking them to the,ep095
951,developing island of Ko ROM and,ep095
954,everything around here is about the,ep095
957,simple life so for gosh I thought would,ep095
960,take a lot of adjustments I'm not quite,ep095
963,sure what I can give up few time I,ep095
966,really interested to say all the houses,ep095
969,and say which one cons if I can live,ep095
972,without the first two places offer,ep095
975,completely different perspectives on,ep095
978,what life could be like here I mean it's,ep095
981,not exactly what I'm used to in Sydney,ep095
984,but overall its western style which is,ep095
987,what I want it we've got the mod cons at,ep095
990,the end of the day but it is one of the,ep095
993,crucial things I'm going to show you a,ep095
996,house a command positional house perfect,ep095
999,you we like the price because it's just,ep095
1002,two hundred US dollars and that's not,ep095
1005,the house is it yeah it is the house no,ep095
1008,there's no walls that's the bathroom,ep095
1011,yeah you just stand up if you do your,ep095
1014,pool yeah that's the furthest thing from,ep095
1017,western style I could ever imagine,ep095
1020,look it's another three hundred dollars,ep095
1023,that we can spend on the resort we,ep095
1026,really have to be mindful of what we,ep095
1029,spend Luka strict on budget but I don't,ep095
1032,want to give up my old life entirely,ep095
1035,someone will have to compromise budgets,ep095
1038,and location and wall walls with island,ep095
1041,life a little too outside the box for,ep095
1044,gosh',ep095
1047,sang shifts focus back to the mainland,ep095
1050,where he's able to find a semi-western,ep095
1053,house with a third bedroom and plenty of,ep095
1056,outdoor space for the kids and dog the,ep095
1059,wheeler is three bedrooms and three,ep095
1062,baths romance with promise the seven,ep095
1065,hundred US dollars per month saying we,ep095
1068,said five hundred yeah but this house,ep095
1071,has a pool and lots of big space outside,ep095
1074,I'd like you to just go through this,ep095
1077,first this is the lounge room yeah it's,ep095
1080,a large room I thought it was a garage,ep095
1083,with doors like that it's dark not,ep095
1086,really a much natural light in here I,ep095
1089,guess you've gotta leave the doors open,ep095
1092,well we got the furniture I can't really,ep095
1095,imagine myself hanging out in here I,ep095
1098,have to say that's the kitchen yeah it's,ep095
1101,not really western-style I'd be missing,ep095
1104,everything in here unit just to buy,ep095
1107,extra stuff I want to stick to the,ep095
1110,budget and with no kitchen what,ep095
1113,I could not do it do we have a hot water,ep095
1116,oh no not at all,ep095
1119,$700 and there's no hot water no,ep095
1122,appliances no hot water it's starting to,ep095
1125,dawn on me this is real life now so is,ep095
1128,this the biggest one yeah this is the,ep095
1131,biggest one so this would be our only,ep095
1134,there comes good these you can put do,ep095
1137,that we'll bet in well we get rid of,ep095
1140,this furniture because this is more like,ep095
1143,outdoor furniture to me it's not as a,ep095
1146,big bed you said that there's an ensuite,ep095
1149,yeah I wonder if it looks anything like,ep095
1152,this oh no it doesn't I realize we're in,ep095
1155,Cambodia so I'm not really gonna get,ep095
1158,everything that I was hoping for three,ep095
1161,bedrooms it's what I wanted boys,ep095
1164,wouldn't have to share but walking,ep095
1167,through the house I'm really not,ep095
1170,impressed gosh I will have to give up,ep095
1173,the Western world because it doesn't,ep095
1176,exist here it doesn't exist in Cambodia,ep095
1179,everything is Cambodia style Cambodia,ep095
1182,way oh that's a lot of outdoor space you,ep095
1185,can imagine the boys and the dog would,ep095
1188,really enjoy hanging out here we've got,ep095
1191,a pool that's a nice bonus I wouldn't,ep095
1194,put a foot in there now mm-hmm,ep095
1197,it's been abandoned for three months now,ep095
1200,and I guess I would have to clean it,ep095
1203,myself right yeah you'll do your own,ep095
1206,cleaning yes I mean this outdoor space,ep095
1209,could really change my mind about this,ep095
1212,place I like spending a lot of time,ep095
1215,outside and so do the kids of course and,ep095
1218,I think we could make that quite a nice,ep095
1221,livable area it's a large house but over,ep095
1224,the budget that I was expecting to spend,ep095
1227,too many things to fix and clean and for,ep095
1230,me it's quite a long commute I'm really,ep095
1233,worried it's way over my budget and,ep095
1236,definitely non-western style but kosher,ep095
1239,seems to be liking that other area and,ep095
1242,that's a bit of a worry because,ep095
1245,certainly not something that I expected,ep095
1248,or I'm thinking about,ep095
1251,to start with it's well over the budget,ep095
1254,and it's very far away from the island I,ep095
1257,know in the budget and the location is,ep095
1260,so important to you but that's a really,ep095
1263,big decision to make,ep095
1266,Luke and Dasha are ditching their hectic,ep095
1269,corporate jobs and big house back in,ep095
1272,Australia and redesigning their lives in,ep095
1275,Cambodia we're gonna have,ep095
1278,good family time together highs in that,ep095
1281,gray sihanoukville province is an,ep095
1284,up-and-coming travel destination and,ep095
1287,it's the future side of their new resort,ep095
1290,do you think we can find a house here,ep095
1293,I'm not quite sure but with a simpler,ep095
1296,way of living in the region and their,ep095
1299,money tied up in a brand new venture,ep095
1302,they need to decide what they're willing,ep095
1305,to live without what about the 2 bedroom,ep095
1308,villa for 600 before me steel it's over,ep095
1311,the budget and it's far away from the,ep095
1314,island at the same time it's quite,ep095
1317,modern it's not too bad,ep095
1320,washing machine freeze the kitchens okay,ep095
1323,I can live without an oven but I really,ep095
1326,don't like that there's no outdoor space,ep095
1329,backyard so that's gonna be a little,ep095
1332,tough on their kids in the dog what,ep095
1335,about the island house for me it's so,ep095
1338,close to work and it's right on the,ep095
1341,beach and it's $200 I know you'd be,ep095
1344,saving a lot of money but I just don't,ep095
1347,think I'd be able to handle I don't know,ep095
1350,how the kids will be able to handle it I,ep095
1353,mean it's really off the grid that's the,ep095
1356,bathroom yeah just stand up there's no,ep095
1359,mod cons of whatsoever,ep095
1362,I'd really have to have a big think,ep095
1365,about it what do you think about the,ep095
1368,three bedroom villa it ticks the boxes,ep095
1371,for the three bedrooms and I like the,ep095
1374,outdoor area we got a pool,ep095
1377,that's a nice,ep095
1380,the boys would love the pool once it's,ep095
1383,cleaned off the dog would have its base,ep095
1386,to run around for me to start with it's,ep095
1389,well over the budget and there's so many,ep095
1392,things to add that's the kitchen yeah,ep095
1395,you're missing everything in here you,ep095
1398,need just to buy extra stuff,ep095
1401,[Music],ep095
1404,I mean for me it's a no-brainer I'm,ep095
1407,sorry but the shack is out just way too,ep095
1410,much that would need to be done to that,ep095
1413,place it's just too too simple for me to,ep095
1416,even consider I can understand that's a,ep095
1419,big culture shock for you,ep095
1422,no matter how much money we're saving I,ep095
1425,really could not imagine myself living,ep095
1428,in those circumstances so that leaves us,ep095
1431,with two options the three-bedroom pool,ep095
1434,villa and the two-bedroom the location,ep095
1437,is much the same so that doesn't really,ep095
1440,help us for me really it's all about the,ep095
1443,outdoor space two boys with heaps of,ep095
1446,energy and a dog so that's the plus for,ep095
1449,the three-bedroom Villa there's a lot of,ep095
1452,outdoor area there's a pool if we clean,ep095
1455,it up well it's very expensive and has,ep095
1458,no kitchen and has no hot water in it,ep095
1461,it's a big expense in the two-bedroom,ep095
1464,villa,ep095
1467,I just don't know with the outdoor area,ep095
1470,having none really there's just no way,ep095
1473,for them to run around I guess two,ep095
1476,bedroom villa we'll have to put up with,ep095
1479,all the bathrooms and water leaks and,ep095
1482,there's a lot of things to be fixed but,ep095
1485,the bigger house will have definitely,ep095
1488,much more work and more money the two,ep095
1491,bedroom villa with the final answer is,ep095
1494,that we have taken for our family will,ep095
1497,be the best choice I don't know I'm not,ep095
1500,too happy about the boys sharing the,ep095
1503,room I'd rather them have their own room,ep095
1506,but I think the front bedroom could work,ep095
1509,for the boys and that's enough space at,ep095
1512,the end of the day the three bedroom,ep095
1515,will cost a fortune so you want me to,ep095
1518,sacrifice the outdoor space and three,ep095
1521,bedrooms for the budget yes I think so I,ep095
1524,mean the kitchen is okay it's got most,ep095
1527,of my cons obviously there's no oven but,ep095
1530,I guess in Cambodia I'm not gonna find,ep095
1533,that anywhere so we made a decision I,ep095
1536,think so I think the two bedrooms a lot,ep095
1539,of this all right,ep095
1542,the,ep095
1545,the stiff drink I think I need several,ep095
1548,cocktails,ep095
1551,[Music],ep095
1554,that shoes off there Belvedere hello I,ep095
1557,was scared when we decided to move to,ep095
1560,Cambodia but it's not as bad as I,ep095
1563,thought and I think we've managed to,ep095
1566,make a home hey puppy,ep095
1569,hey puppy I truly enjoy it as well and,ep095
1572,although I have to travel to Island,ep095
1575,everyday Resort is going well and we get,ep095

234,Danny Bryce get there get a hurricane,ep096
237,kids together you know how Search,ep096
240,hurricane preparedness is always gonna,ep096
243,be on our mind cuz it's a big part of,ep096
246,life when you live in South Florida,ep096
249,a CBS concrete block house would be,ep096
252,awesome what dream house would be the,ep096
255,alternative and it's not ideal but we,ep096
258,would like to have the hurricane,ep096
261,shutters that are fit to put in place,ep096
264,that one oh really close to the,ep096
267,neighbors huh yeah yeah there's that,ep096
270,zero property line that yeah I really,ep096
273,don't care about not enough room for the,ep096
276,boat for my boat I'm gonna need a,ep096
279,specific Drive would have my need room I,ep096
282,would like to have an area to where I,ep096
285,can pull the boat off to the side and,ep096
288,sit by stop and not be in the way of the,ep096
291,cars and eat prefer a circular driveway,ep096
294,for easy in and out for the other cars a,ep096
297,big backyard is also key a pool would be,ep096
300,great if there's not a pool room for a,ep096
303,pool would be awesome I would love for,ep096
306,our kitchen to be an open-concept,ep096
309,kitchen that's really important to her,ep096
312,and I think it is to me too,ep096
315,I like the family to be together as a,ep096
318,unit they'd also like to have an,ep096
321,additional informal living space for the,ep096
324,kids so the grown-ups can have some,ep096
327,occasional quiet time there's a walk-in,ep096
330,closet you know I gotta have a walk-in,ep096
333,closet I would also love a home with the,ep096
336,fireplace as odd as it is in Florida and,ep096
339,especially at Christmastime somewhere to,ep096
342,hang the stockings for the kids that get,ep096
345,that full-on experience I just so look,ep096
348,forward to the memories that we're gonna,ep096
351,create in this house first up a home,ep096
354,with charm that should appeal to Suzanne,ep096
357,wow this is really cute okay guys so,ep096
360,this thing is kind of a craftsman,ep096
363,cottagey home and it is four bedrooms,ep096
366,three baths Oh awesome,ep096
369,Oh has a pool four and it's listed at,ep096
372,"350,000 right Betsy Julie there's a",ep096
375,little bit high it's like the top of our,ep096
378,budget and the driveways a little bit,ep096
381,small like I can't get a boat in this,ep096
384,driveway well maybe you could take this,ep096
387,planter area out and widen it maybe a,ep096
390,little bit each way maybe that's doable,ep096
393,yeah this house doesn't have an,ep096
396,room with the driveway for me to add in,ep096
399,my boat maybe for about 2500 3000 I,ep096
402,could get this driver widened out to,ep096
405,where I could put the boat in and we,ep096
408,could fit it in comfortably let's take a,ep096
411,look inside and just keep an open mind,ep096
414,okay,ep096
417,so this is a wood frame home hmm yes and,ep096
420,it does not have hurricane protection,ep096
423,okay we are gonna have to add hurricane,ep096
426,protection or shutters on this house so,ep096
429,there's gonna be an expense there with,ep096
432,that for sure so come on in okay that's,ep096
435,great I love it it's a definite yes time,ep096
438,yeah okay so over here you have your,ep096
441,formal living room I never hear you have,ep096
444,your formal dining room okay great nice,ep096
447,and big in here not my style but I think,ep096
450,I could fix everything like this chip,ep096
453,right here on the table okay yeah no I,ep096
456,love that about it I would pay extra for,ep096
459,that it's just furniture Robert doesn't,ep096
462,come with that and if they're selling,ep096
465,anything in here we could find out right,ep096
468,over here we've got our formal living,ep096
471,room okay this has got your fireplace,ep096
474,nice and open I love it I love this,ep096
477,fireplace this is so adorable over here,ep096
480,you have your breakfast nook where would,ep096
483,we put the other TV Raman okay another,ep096
486,living space so you do have an enclosed,ep096
489,sunroom here so you can use it for a,ep096
492,living space maybe a play room not ideal,ep096
495,so here's the kitchen this is your,ep096
498,kitchen come on in it is a galley,ep096
501,kitchen which I don't like it I don't,ep096
504,want to me it feels like you're still,ep096
507,kind of isolated over here yeah even,ep096
510,though it's a little bit open to this,ep096
513,living areas cooking in here you might,ep096
516,be a little bit cut off not an ideal,ep096
519,scenario with the galley but it does,ep096
522,open up quite a bit to the breakfast,ep096
525,nook she shows them a bathroom on the,ep096
528,first floor and takes them to the first,ep096
531,of four bedrooms so over here we have a,ep096
534,private entrance that'll lead you into,ep096
537,the bedroom oh cool I like it because,ep096
540,you have the privacy if we were to have,ep096
543,guests over and everything they have,ep096
546,their own door to go out and there's,ep096
549,actually the bathroom right there oh,ep096
552,that's convenient they head to the,ep096
555,stairs and go up to the second floor,ep096
558,were they looking on the hall bath and,ep096
561,two kids bedrooms so over here we have,ep096
564,the master bath okay this is adorable I,ep096
567,love the clawfoot tubs my grandma used,ep096
570,to have a tub like this in Kentucky,ep096
573,there's cool I really love it let's take,ep096
576,a look at the master bedroom I love that,ep096
579,this river I love that it's nice and,ep096
582,bright yeah very plantation shutters,ep096
585,I love them I love that medallion that,ep096
588,is so cute and charming,ep096
591,I love it well I love the Medina if you,ep096
594,love the medallion okay good answer,ep096
597,got a good place closet over here okay,ep096
600,well that's very important oh my gosh,ep096
603,that's a fantastic closet that's mine,ep096
606,that's enough room for you yep okay guys,ep096
609,and out here we have the sunroom okay we,ep096
612,could potentially use this as an extra,ep096
615,living space for the kids,ep096
618,yes you can open up the window from the,ep096
621,kitchen so here's the yard this is a,ep096
624,great yard,ep096
627,there's my spot ah man that's worth that,ep096
630,right there oh gosh waterfall this is a,ep096
633,black bottom pool got the waterfall the,ep096
636,stone waterfall gives you kind of that,ep096
639,tropical feeling oh it's beautiful yeah,ep096
642,it looks like they may even have the,ep096
645,things in place for a baby gate they do,ep096
648,because you're gonna need that with,ep096
651,price yes I really love the backyard the,ep096
654,pole the waterfall is just really,ep096
657,relaxing so is this something you guys,ep096
660,would consider I do love that this house,ep096
663,has four bedrooms that was a huge thing,ep096
666,for me it's got the character in the,ep096
669,charm I love the backyard there's a pool,ep096
672,there's a lot of things going for this,ep096
675,house the driveway is not big enough but,ep096
678,I see us being able to add to the,ep096
681,driveway but one thing about it though,ep096
684,is the kitchen is the galley kitchen,ep096
687,which was a deal breaker for me we're at,ep096
690,the max of our budget then the hurricane,ep096
693,protection probably looking about five,ep096
696,grand to get the shutters to do all the,ep096
699,windows not ideal I'm gonna have to,ep096
702,think about that's something we can work,ep096
705,with or not Robert wants a ranch-style,ep096
708,house with a big yard and Julie delivers,ep096
711,look right here we have plenty of room,ep096
714,to park the boat,ep096
717,[Music],ep096
720,yeah you went in fridge buddy,ep096
723,I'm gonna help me stage sure good big,ep096
726,sister huh that's up good right working,ep096
729,"with a max budget of 350,000 dollars",ep096
732,this Palm City Florida couple is on the,ep096
735,hunt for a storm resistant home with at,ep096
738,least four bedrooms and enough parking,ep096
741,for the family boat so far they've seen,ep096
744,a two-story craftsman with the charm,ep096
747,Susana clicking for but it wasn't,ep096
750,Roberts preferred ranch as Suzanne who,ep096
753,would like to spend less than three,ep096
756,hundred and fifty thousand dollars was,ep096
759,balking at it sticker price,ep096
762,[Music],ep096
765,so now their agent has lined up a,ep096
768,less-expensive option okay guys so this,ep096
771,is a three-bedroom two-bath pool home,ep096
774,it's got seventeen hundred and,ep096
777,twenty-two square feet I'm going 325 325,ep096
780,325 hi for me Julie and you're getting,ep096
783,primarily everything you want yeah,ep096
786,except that fourth bedroom that we,ep096
789,really need I like that it's a ranch,ep096
792,homes it's not exactly my style I do,ep096
795,prefer either a craftsman or a bungalow,ep096
798,I really love the size of this front,ep096
801,property we did want to do a circle,ep096
804,driveway going out look really good here,ep096
807,wasn't it and look right here we have,ep096
810,plenty of room to park the boat so I,ep096
813,really like the impression when I first,ep096
816,came off the curb side and solved in the,ep096
819,ranch house I liked how I can add to the,ep096
822,driveway do the circle driveway I had,ep096
825,plenty of room for the boat this is a,ep096
828,wood frame home it is not concrete block,ep096
831,like you originally wanted can we live,ep096
834,with that I wonder if it has shutters,ep096
837,for it I don't see anything out right,ep096
840,now take a look inside go look oh wow,ep096
843,it's cute huh I like the openness it's,ep096
846,beautiful how you can just see all the,ep096
849,way out to the back when you first walk,ep096
852,in I love that there's a fireplace,ep096
855,it's so cute your stockings yeah baby,ep096
858,what do you think about the shelves I,ep096
861,could probably do without that okay over,ep096
864,here you have your formal dining room,ep096
867,light fixtures got to go but I like the,ep096
870,room you don't like this light fixture,ep096
873,Hale,ep096
876,not really never here guys we have your,ep096
879,family room so this is like a little bit,ep096
882,more of an informal family area yeah we,ep096
885,could have a little area here set up,ep096
888,with the TV so when you're cooking we,ep096
891,can all be part of the fun well yeah I,ep096
894,like the idea though too that we could,ep096
897,have that as the TV room and this would,ep096
900,be a little bit more of an informal spot,ep096
903,and behind you Suzanne look what you got,ep096
906,I love it I love the counter space lot,ep096
909,of cabinet space yeah the only thing is,ep096
912,it's like they updated the countertops,ep096
915,and then painted the cabinets and the,ep096
918,backsplash is still it's just kind of,ep096
921,mismatched bowls of ix+,ep096
924,it's pretty it just doesn't go with the,ep096
927,kitchen so before we head outside let me,ep096
930,show you guys the bedrooms hey guys this,ep096
933,is the master,ep096
936,yeah I'm just scared to look in the,ep096
939,closet oh I know I know you need you can,ep096
942,save this little spot for Rob yeah all,ep096
945,right it's nice at least there's a,ep096
948,master bath it's probably like half the,ep096
951,size of the bathroom we had least half,ep096
954,so it is a little bit small but at least,ep096
957,we'd have our own bathroom down the hall,ep096
960,is the guest bath and two bedrooms even,ep096
963,though the bedrooms are nice and I like,ep096
966,that they're together I was really,ep096
969,looking for that fourth bedroom okay,ep096
972,guys and out here we have your covered,ep096
975,lanai like I like a stranger and now,ep096
978,here we have the pool tents this is,ep096
981,beautiful yeah I do like it yeah great,ep096
984,backyard I'm not really comfortable,ep096
987,though with how open it is with a baby,ep096
990,you know it's kind of scary to think,ep096
993,about I'm pretty concerned about the,ep096
996,fact that there's no fence around the,ep096
999,pool for the baby I mean from a parent's,ep096
1002,point of view you want some kind of,ep096
1005,protection or something there to put,ep096
1008,something between the pool and your baby,ep096
1011,and I agree it's something we definitely,ep096
1014,need yeah we definitely have to do that,ep096
1017,[Music],ep096
1020,I like the inside the outsides great,ep096
1023,great area it's a little high on the,ep096
1026,price for me yeah I don't think the,ep096
1029,price is that bad,ep096
1032,"Suzanne was one to stick to the 300,000",ep096
1035,but I know realistically in this area,ep096
1038,we're gonna have to give ourselves a,ep096
1041,little bit of leeway and we're not,ep096
1044,getting that fourth bedroom you know,ep096
1047,this was nice actually like we're,ep096
1050,gaining another room you know this is a,ep096
1053,place that we can come out and sit sure,ep096
1056,but there are a few things with in,ep096
1059,regards to the budget that we would have,ep096
1062,to think about we want the circular,ep096
1065,driveway hurricane protection right she,ep096
1068,and the baby fence just cost just kind,ep096
1071,of keep adding up I would like to see,ep096
1074,some houses with concrete block,ep096
1077,construction and maybe the fourth,ep096
1080,bedroom so the next house has that,ep096
1083,fourth bedroom and the concrete block,ep096
1086,but hey honey,ep096
1089,[Music],ep096
1092,"with a max budget of 350,000 dollars",ep096
1095,Robert and Suzanne are looking for a,ep096
1098,four-bedroom home in Palm City Florida,ep096
1101,so far they've seen a Craftsman bungalow,ep096
1104,with the charm Suzanne wants and the,ep096
1107,four bedrooms they prefer but parking,ep096
1110,for the boat would be tight and it was,ep096
1113,at the top of their budget then they saw,ep096
1116,a more modern ranch more to Robert's,ep096
1119,taste with ideal boat parking but there,ep096
1122,was no fourth bedroom and neither home,ep096
1125,was constructed with hurricane resistant,ep096
1128,concrete blocks oh my gosh it's so cute,ep096
1131,I love it what do you think yes,ep096
1134,definitely your style so I think this is,ep096
1137,a great compromise for you guys okay,ep096
1140,it's really cute I love the Key West,ep096
1143,bungalow look this house is a,ep096
1146,four-bedroom three-bath concrete block,ep096
1149,with impact windows so the list price is,ep096
1152,360 360 Julie honey it is a budget but,ep096
1155,it has a lot of the features that you're,ep096
1158,looking for but I'm worried about the,ep096
1161,size of the driveway I don't have room,ep096
1164,for the boat and there's no way to put a,ep096
1167,circle driveway in here the front yard,ep096
1170,is this very small you're gonna have to,ep096
1173,compromise a few things so for Robert it,ep096
1176,is really important to have room for,ep096
1179,their boats and for the circle driveway,ep096
1182,I don't know if he's going to compromise,ep096
1185,on that or not that's something I could,ep096
1188,probably compromise on but I don't know,ep096
1191,we'll have to see let's go in and take a,ep096
1194,look all right let's take a look,ep096
1197,oh my gosh that's great,ep096
1200,walking in the house I see this big,ep096
1203,open-concept great room I can see from,ep096
1206,the front of the house to the back of,ep096
1209,the house I really like it so here we've,ep096
1212,got one bedroom so this is like the,ep096
1215,fourth bedroom this would be your fourth,ep096
1218,bedroom yep I love the high ceilings and,ep096
1221,these tile floors are beautiful they are,ep096
1224,beautiful so this is tile huh this is,ep096
1227,tile this is the wood what luck exactly,ep096
1230,and here's your kitchen it is my wife,ep096
1233,bright open kitchen this area I love how,ep096
1236,it's open to the living area I love that,ep096
1239,the kitchen is open to the living area,ep096
1242,so you're not closed off into some,ep096
1245,hallway kitchen that's very conducive,ep096
1248,for a family over here this is gonna be,ep096
1251,your dining room okay that's great I,ep096
1254,love that this is a nice big open space,ep096
1257,and over here this is gonna be your,ep096
1260,great room okay so this is really the,ep096
1263,only living space this is your living,ep096
1266,space yeah okay but the thing I don't,ep096
1269,like is that we're stuck to just this,ep096
1272,one room right well that's where you,ep096
1275,could utilize the room up front you can,ep096
1278,use it as a den or a separate TV room,ep096
1281,but I really wanted it to be our fourth,ep096
1284,bedroom so it's not ideal,ep096
1287,Julie shows them two guest bedrooms and,ep096
1290,two guest bathrooms before heading to,ep096
1293,the master bedroom oh my gosh I love it,ep096
1296,look at these ceilings,ep096
1299,that's a tray ceiling and you've got,ep096
1302,recessed lighting in that's beautiful so,ep096
1305,I love it it has all those little,ep096
1308,details that make a house charming it's,ep096
1311,not cookie cutter would have been really,ep096
1314,nice if they were to carry the tile into,ep096
1317,the master take a look at that closet,ep096
1320,Suzanne wow this is a great closet this,ep096
1323,is pretty big yeah that looks good oh my,ep096
1326,god he's going all the way back there,ep096
1329,I'm just shocked at the size of the,ep096
1332,master bedroom closet I didn't know that,ep096
1335,was gonna continue going back like that,ep096
1338,it's just it's like dual sinks but a,ep096
1341,dual closet so over here I think you're,ep096
1344,gonna like the master bathroom as well,ep096
1347,okay oh my gosh I love this shower party,ep096
1350,shower I love the dual showerhead the,ep096
1353,rain the rain head from the ceiling,ep096
1356,that's awesome snag it up for me,ep096
1359,okay so this is your covered patio area,ep096
1362,does seem a little small we're really,ep096
1365,close to our neighbors there's hardly,ep096
1368,any room yard at all there's really not,ep096
1371,room for a pool I really wanted the big,ep096
1374,yard there's no pool I don't have the,ep096
1377,option of a pool this is kind of,ep096
1380,disappointing this small backyard small,ep096
1383,patio okay guys remember the reason I'm,ep096
1386,showing you this house it's got a lot of,ep096
1389,the features you wanted concrete block,ep096
1392,impact windows four bedrooms Suzanne's,ep096
1395,dream kitchen I love that it's a little,ep096
1398,bungalow I'm just a little concerned,ep096
1401,that it's over budget it's even over,ep096
1404,your budget now it's time for Robert and,ep096
1407,Suzanne to decide which house they want,ep096
1410,they'll have to choose between their,ep096
1413,priorities a big yard four bedrooms or,ep096
1416,the concrete structure four bedroom,ep096
1419,which you know I want the fourth bedroom,ep096
1422,yes big deal,ep096
1425,[Music],ep096
1428,"with a budget of 350,000 dollars Robert",ep096
1431,and Suzanne have looked at several,ep096
1434,different places in the Palm City,ep096
1437,Florida area in the hopes of finding the,ep096
1440,perfect family home now they have to,ep096
1443,make a tough decision the first one is,ep096
1446,the two storey bungalow style house at,ep096
1449,350 its four-bedroom which you know I,ep096
1452,want the fourth bedroom yes big deal and,ep096
1455,I do like that pool area and the big,ep096
1458,backyard and the charm in that house oh,ep096
1461,my goodness,ep096
1464,big time for me in that house was that,ep096
1467,it's a galley kitchen and then it's also,ep096
1470,wood frame there's no hurricane,ep096
1473,protection on that house either so that,ep096
1476,is an additional cost and we're already,ep096
1479,at 350 so let's talk about the ranch,ep096
1482,next at 325 I know you really like the,ep096
1485,way that house log time yeah I do like,ep096
1488,the style I like the big front yard and,ep096
1491,I did have room for the boat,ep096
1494,I like it being open in the kitchen but,ep096
1497,is only a three-bedroom house that was,ep096
1500,not what we were probably looking for,ep096
1503,had a couple ideas or maybe we could add,ep096
1506,a spot that's what frame and it doesn't,ep096
1509,need hurricane protection the price was,ep096
1512,a pro even it was a little more than I,ep096
1515,want to spend maybe that's a compromise,ep096
1518,we can make the pool was beautiful was,ep096
1521,beautiful the Key West bungalow at 360,ep096
1524,you know I like the Key West bungalow,ep096
1527,south loved the idea was concrete block,ep096
1530,yeah huge plus in the kitchen was,ep096
1533,beautiful we just had the one great room,ep096
1536,right one living space but there was the,ep096
1539,ward bedroom so I mean if you're gonna,ep096
1542,you know give and take a little bit,ep096
1545,that's a that's a pretty good compromise,ep096
1548,the yard and the front was a little,ep096
1551,small and the back I really don't feel,ep096
1554,like I had room in the driveway for the,ep096
1557,boat no room for a pool but that one I,ep096
1560,think the price is just a little bit,ep096
1563,high so which one will they choose,ep096
1566,[Music],ep096
1569,[Applause],ep096
1572,okay so as much as I love to choose,ep096
1575,story in the fourth bedroom I really,ep096
1578,like that the ranch has the extra living,ep096
1581,space and it has the layout that I love,ep096
1584,so maybe I think the ranch is the best,ep096
1587,way to go okay so we're gonna do this,ep096
1590,yeah I think we should call Jolie,ep096
1593,okay lose it yeah okay what I think is,ep096
1596,after we get done with this why you guys,ep096
1599,should be able to handle this not a,ep096
1602,little taking that we have not moved in,ep096
1605,yet we're still doing some minor,ep096
1608,renovations and we have some more things,ep096
1611,to do each and every time we walk in,ep096
1614,here we have a good feeling we know that,ep096
1617,this was the right house out of that,ep096
1620,this house was listed for 325 and we,ep096
1623,"ended up paying 318,000 which was much",ep096
1626,more close to my comfortable budget no,ep096
1629,problems there we painted every every,ep096
1632,wall what's up the kitchen we painted,ep096
1635,the ceilings and we put up beadboard,ep096
1638,wainscoting in the dining room wall we,ep096
1641,did decide to take down the built-in,ep096
1644,shelves around the fireplace underneath,ep096
1647,the shelving there was no flooring so,ep096
1650,now we're gonna be doing a flooring,ep096
1653,throughout the house this one is still,ep096
1656,my favorite out of all three I really,ep096
1659,like this one I think I like the top one,ep096
1662,the best okay I was two of three who the,ep096
1665,things we didn't get in this house first,ep096
1668,off will be the fourth bedroom we have,ep096
1671,an area out to the side of the house in,ep096
1674,the back that already has a concrete,ep096
1677,slab and we figured that we can get a,ep096
1680,pretty good sized room there oh I'll,ep096
1683,have my fourth bedroom hey we didn't get,ep096
1686,a concrete block house so it doesn't,ep096
1689,have that sturdiness to it oh this house,ep096
1692,has been through five hurricanes and I,ep096
1695,feel confident that this house is gonna,ep096
1698,go through them anymore and still be,ep096
1701,here I think one by one we'll change out,ep096
1704,the windows to hurricane impact glass,ep096
1707,and that way we won't don't worry about,ep096
1710,shutters or panels at all didn't get the,ep096
1713,concrete driveway but I have the room to,ep096
1716,put everything that I want in and that's,ep096
1719,something that we can do and also a big,ep096
1722,thing about this house the things that,ep096
1725,we don't have and,ep096
1728,we can change everything was either,ep096
1731,there or could be there it's like we're,ep096
1734,starting a new season in life and it's,ep096
1737,really fun everything worked out the,ep096
1740,Stars lined up for this house you know,ep096
1743,like everything did good so it's really,ep096
1746,done mm-hmm,ep096
12,[Music],ep097
15,this is like a greenhouse Mary doctors,ep097
18,Stephanie and Steven are on the hunt for,ep097
21,a first house in Westchester New York,ep097
24,Cape Cod houses I always see faces in,ep097
27,them I really don't want to live in a,ep097
30,house with that face they also have to,ep097
33,decide if they want to go all-in on a,ep097
36,luxurious single-family home,ep097
39,you can't believe it a so nice house or,ep097
42,put up with the headaches of owning a,ep097
45,multi-family where they live in one unit,ep097
48,and rent out the rest hey how was that,ep097
51,you hear that yes I like the flooring,ep097
54,those still kind of cramped all right we,ep097
57,still have a lot of stuff this is a,ep097
60,multi-family we're saving money,ep097
63,[Music],ep097
66,why don't we just make a fruit salad,ep097
69,good is that okay I agree I use me yes,ep097
72,I'm Steven I'm a surgeon in New York,ep097
75,City I'm Stephanie and I'm a,ep097
78,geriatrician also New York City we met,ep097
81,about eight years ago in a lab and,ep097
84,eventually ended up going to the same,ep097
87,medical school and then when he,ep097
90,graduated then I put a ring on okay so,ep097
93,did you have any new recipes yeah do,ep097
96,they involve apples nope can I throw,ep097
99,them in there nope Stefan is such a,ep097
102,high-energy person she really kind of,ep097
105,brought me out of my shell I think,ep097
108,sometimes you need to be a little bit,ep097
111,creative and modify some things in life,ep097
114,I disagree,ep097
117,steve is very thoughtful kind really,ep097
120,very funny very corny sense of humor,ep097
123,we're currently living in an apartment,ep097
126,in Laura Westchester County a lot of,ep097
129,people who live in Westchester County do,ep097
132,commute to New York we like Westchester,ep097
135,Canada because it gives us a nice,ep097
138,suburban quiet lifestyle which is kind,ep097
141,of tough to find in New York City it's,ep097
144,just a great suburb to plant roots with,ep097
147,just a 45-minute commute to New York,ep097
150,City by train they want to live here for,ep097
153,the long haul and they're ready to stop,ep097
156,renting and buy yeah we have a dog named,ep097
159,our two so we need at least a big enough,ep097
162,yard that you can throw the ball and,ep097
165,have him run a decent distance when I,ep097
168,roll over,ep097
171,and we also have a parakeet named me so,ep097
174,ideally I'd like to have him be able to,ep097
177,fly around he doesn't like it win me so,ep097
180,flies around but you know things have to,ep097
183,happen having me so thinks my hair is a,ep097
186,nest our ideal budget would be anywhere,ep097
189,from 650 to 700 thousand dollars our max,ep097
192,budget would be eight hundred thousand,ep097
195,dollars but they'll have to agree on,ep097
198,what to spend it on they love a,ep097
201,single-family home at this point but,ep097
204,they're open to another type of property,ep097
207,as well,ep097
210,anything where we can live in a portion,ep097
213,of it and rent out the other to kind of,ep097
216,get some more cash flow when we've,ep097
219,graduated from undergrad Medical School,ep097
222,we accumulate a lot of debt so a couple,ep097
225,hundred thousand dollars anyway to,ep097
228,recoup some of those expenses would be,ep097
231,really ideal I'm a little nervous about,ep097
234,multifamily homes because while their,ep097
237,income potentials there would be,ep097
240,sacrificing a lot of our privacy I think,ep097
243,right now maybe we're worried about,ep097
246,compromising too much because we're used,ep097
249,to making sacrifices and we really this,ep097
252,should really be our dream home this,ep097
255,would really be a place that we can,ep097
258,settle into it looks like it's a big,ep097
261,yard I personally like the Cape Cod,ep097
264,style houses or ones that kind of have,ep097
267,face like features with the two windows,ep097
270,so it looks kind of unique and funny to,ep097
273,me look at its face the eyes nose their,ep097
276,mouth right there looks like I didn't,ep097
279,hit my head and soon my ideas I'll would,ep097
282,be a colonial house I like the open,ep097
285,space this is the cramped ceiling you,ep097
288,don't like so much okay looks pretty,ep097
291,cramped my ideal kitchen would be a nice,ep097
294,subway tiles with stainless steel,ep097
297,appliances like that island looks like a,ep097
300,lot of people can gather on that I own,ep097
303,the place,ep097
306,I do like that fridge I actually don't,ep097
309,really like the tile at all the,ep097
312,stainless steel and the white tile just,ep097
315,look very sterile or like maybe so I,ep097
318,don't really like that I like something,ep097
321,more warm maybe warm wooden colors or,ep097
324,country kitchen like if I had my,ep097
327,druthers I've put everything in straw,ep097
330,subway tile did you want to call,ep097
333,Michelle and go look around yeah it's,ep097
336,ready I think this is gonna be the,ep097
339,biggest purchase of Our Lives it's a,ep097
342,huge investment and we're hoping we're,ep097
345,making the right decision,ep097
348,[Music],ep097
351,today I'm showing you a multi-family,ep097
354,house oh it's pretty nice it's built in,ep097
357,the 1838 it's a colonial 38 I looks a,ep097
360,lot newer than that it has three units,ep097
363,three units yes where are they all,ep097
366,hiding there is a unit on the first and,ep097
369,second floor,ep097
372,those are 2-bedroom 1-bath about a,ep097
375,thousand square feet and then the last,ep097
378,unit is in the basement or lower level a,ep097
381,one monitor one bath that would be the,ep097
384,smallest what's the asking price so the,ep097
387,asking price is seven hundred and twenty,ep097
390,thousand oh that's great for three units,ep097
393,yes and it was reduced from seven,ep097
396,hundred and fifty thousand that's,ep097
399,actually making my wallet clear happy,ep097
402,yes I love that it has three units so,ep097
405,there's two potential units for income I,ep097
408,mean we have ten thirteen years of,ep097
411,educational debt to make up for us so,ep097
414,the price is amazing they head up the,ep097
417,stairs to see the second floor unit,ep097
420,first so let's check out the kitchen,ep097
423,Wow I really like this I love this,ep097
426,backsplash it's beautiful Seth likes the,ep097
429,backsplash it's the subway tile but it's,ep097
432,okay you know it's kind of like an,ep097
435,avant-garde version of subway tile it's,ep097
438,not subway tile but is so much better,ep097
441,than that and it's beautiful I love that,ep097
444,agree to disagree,ep097
447,got it so what's next so here is the,ep097
450,living room I like the flooring yeah,ep097
453,really nice you know for the bird for,ep097
456,the plants I think this would be a,ep097
459,really great room I know it's still kind,ep097
462,of cramped out right we still have a lot,ep097
465,of stuff this is something that we have,ep097
468,to though we have to wrestle with,ep097
471,because this is a multi-family we're,ep097
474,saving money it would be like living in,ep097
477,an apartment it's a thousand square feet,ep097
480,remember yeah so let's take a look at,ep097
483,the bathroom this is the one bath for,ep097
486,this apartment this is the only bathroom,ep097
489,for the whole unit right correct every,ep097
492,apartment has one bathroom okay so let's,ep097
495,see the bedrooms,ep097
498,I sense as Stevens really struggling,ep097
501,with it's kind of all or nothing we go,ep097
504,for the multi-family we're gonna save,ep097
507,money we're gonna sacrifice the space,ep097
510,and that kind of privacy the house would,ep097
513,give us all that kind of family value in,ep097
516,that living space that we're looking for,ep097
519,maybe long term we've really are,ep097
522,struggling to kind of figure out where,ep097
525,our priorities are gonna be at this,ep097
528,point then Steven and Stephanie head,ep097
531,downstairs to check out the second,ep097
534,apartment which is an exact replica of a,ep097
537,top floor very very similar to upstairs,ep097
540,surprise it's pretty much the same as,ep097
543,the one appraised exactly well there's a,ep097
546,side door now that goes out to the yard,ep097
549,signage so this works out well for,ep097
552,having a dog yes I would foresee this,ep097
555,being the owners unit just because you,ep097
558,have access to the yard,ep097
561,typical so the tenant will be upstairs,ep097
564,right is it very noisy then the people,ep097
567,upstairs,ep097
570,interviewer the sound downstairs that's,ep097
573,something to consider I'll be right back,ep097
576,run,ep097
579,hey how was that you hear that yes you,ep097
582,can hear and you walk normally,ep097
585,okay wait yeah we're gonna hear it so,ep097
588,that is one of the downsides of having,ep097
591,your units stacked on top of each other,ep097
594,exactly they take a quick look at the,ep097
597,basement level unit then go outside to,ep097
600,see the yard so they come around come in,ep097
603,this way,ep097
606,right exactly they come around from that,ep097
609,side it's a good-size backyard yeah,ep097
612,actually that's good for a dive so,ep097
615,you're George - yeah he could run around,ep097
618,today was really eye-opening you know,ep097
621,it's a newly renovated so it looks,ep097
624,really great inside it has a great,ep097
627,income potential we set our budget at,ep097
630,"800,000 and this is 720 and to be able",ep097
633,to have three units it basically just,ep097
636,pay very minimal amount to live in this,ep097
639,space there's a question of when is it,ep097
642,time for us to stop postponing all those,ep097
645,things that we were postponing while we,ep097
648,were training and enjoy the life great,ep097
651,investment but there's a lot that I wish,ep097
654,there was more of do you have any other,ep097
657,places you can look at yes absolutely I,ep097
660,wanted to show you a place where would,ep097
663,be more suitable to your lifestyle as,ep097
666,opposed to investment opportunity okay,ep097
669,absolutely,ep097
672,so now they're meeting their broker at,ep097
675,this single-family sidewall colonial the,ep097
678,asking price is at the top of your rain,ep097
681,relative kindergarten projects edible,ep097
684,marker oh that's awesome,ep097
687,Steven and Stephanie both doctors are in,ep097
690,the market for their first home their,ep097
693,"dilemma to spend their $800,000 budget",ep097
696,on an income-producing multi-family to,ep097
699,help them pay off their student debt or,ep097
702,just take the plunge and buy a,ep097
705,single-family home for themselves their,ep097
708,dog and their bird Misha so far they've,ep097
711,seen a well-priced multi-family with,ep097
714,three units it was updated and had a big,ep097
717,yard for their dog but it would mean,ep097
720,they'd have to live in a two-bedroom,ep097
723,one-bath unit with little privacy so now,ep097
726,they've asked to see a single-family,ep097
729,home instead I do like the quiet street,ep097
732,that porch looks like it's gonna be,ep097
735,interesting it's awesome so this is a,ep097
738,"three bedroom one and a half bath 1,900",ep097
741,square foot okay the side wall colonial,ep097
744,a lotta charm it was built in 1935 the,ep097
747,asking price is at the top of your range,ep097
750,"at $799,000 income potential not here Oh",ep097
753,we'd have to really like this yeah got,ep097
756,it without the potential for rental,ep097
759,income and with our student debt would,ep097
762,be a tough test for me to love it,ep097
765,this is your living room I like the nice,ep097
768,tall ceilings that this feels that makes,ep097
771,it feel so much more spacious so next we,ep097
774,are going to see the sunroom so many,ep097
777,windows can you still just fly in here,ep097
780,and not fly anywhere else,ep097
783,well close us off a little mesh and then,ep097
786,put some little trees in here and then,ep097
789,he can have his own aviary good so you,ep097
792,won't ever get worried only if you walk,ep097
795,in here without food okay they check out,ep097
798,the dining room and then the kitchen I,ep097
801,like the white subway tile oh there's,ep097
804,your subway tile can't get away from me,ep097
807,oh yeah haha I don't know why stuff,ep097
810,doesn't like subway tile it's not,ep097
813,offensive it's great you know I wanted,ep097
816,something warmer than the white I'm,ep097
819,really disappointed in this kitchen I,ep097
822,wish that I liked it more but everything,ep097
825,about it is something that was not on my,ep097
828,initial wish list or kitchen it doesn't,ep097
831,have the warm inviting colors the wooden,ep097
834,cabinetry so it's not the kitchen I'm,ep097
837,looking for you have this really nice,ep097
840,covered porch I love this this is so,ep097
843,great there's no other way to describe,ep097
846,it it's open it feels like a special,ep097
849,special secret place those kitchen lacks,ep097
852,entertaining spaces this but this could,ep097
855,definitely be our entertainment space,ep097
858,instead so let's see the backyard,ep097
861,wow you and we cut these bushes back,ep097
864,there's just not enough space for our,ep097
867,two large backyard is one of our top,ep097
870,priorities so there's really nothing we,ep097
873,can do to change this so this is a,ep097
876,really big negative they head inside to,ep097
879,see the first floor half bathroom the,ep097
882,large semi finished basement and then,ep097
885,head upstairs to the second level so,ep097
888,first we have the hall bath on the right,ep097
891,okay nice and spacious yeah I mean it's,ep097
894,a three,ep097
897,room with one full bathroom here it,ep097
900,would be a site in the morning yes they,ep097
903,look in on the two guest bedrooms before,ep097
906,seeing the master oh it's a really,ep097
909,decent sized bedroom and I guess that's,ep097
912,the entryway to the patio here we go,ep097
915,this is pretty nice wow it's a good view,ep097
918,good space,ep097
921,I think it's a great special unique,ep097
924,addition the overall space and the view,ep097
927,is beautiful it is I think the major,ep097
930,thing that we were looking for was for,ep097
933,our to that big backyard with the trees,ep097
936,to offer some shade and just very small,ep097
939,on the contrary the other pet that we,ep097
942,have Lisa will be very happy in the,ep097
945,sunroom the kitchen itself was really,ep097
948,inadequate I really wish that the,ep097
951,kitchen was bigger and this house had an,ep097
954,"open concept at $800,000 we're really",ep097
957,stretching our money bin here at this,ep097
960,point I think this house is a good,ep097
963,stepping stone for our first,ep097
966,single-family home there's a lot of,ep097
969,potential and I think we can get used to,ep097
972,some of the aspects of it then we're not,ep097
975,thrilled about it now but I really am,ep097
978,hoping to see other houses that may,ep097
981,fulfill more of our priorities the next,ep097
984,house is also at the top of their budget,ep097
987,but it may give them more bang for the,ep097
990,buck,ep097
993,the yard is 0.26 acres so definitely a,ep097
996,lot of space for our two,ep097
999,[Music],ep097
1002,dr. Steven and Stephanie have to decide,ep097
1005,of the home they want to buy in,ep097
1008,Westchester New York should be a single,ep097
1011,family place just for themselves or an,ep097
1014,income-producing multi-family that would,ep097
1017,help them pay off their student loans,ep097
1020,"working with an $800,000 budget they've",ep097
1023,seen a well-priced multi-family home,ep097
1026,that would mean rental income for them,ep097
1029,but tight living quarters then they saw,ep097
1032,a more spacious single-family with,ep097
1035,attractive features but it was at the,ep097
1038,top of their budget and the yard was,ep097
1041,small so now their brokers lined up,ep097
1044,another single-family home this time,ep097
1047,with a bigger yard Cape Cod houses I,ep097
1050,always see faces of them this one with,ep097
1053,the bay window looks like the left eye,ep097
1056,has a black eye and then the big eye,ep097
1059,here in the nose I really don't want to,ep097
1062,live in a house with that face the yard,ep097
1065,is 0.26 acres so definitely a lot of,ep097
1068,space for our two in the price this is,ep097
1071,asking $7.99 so again the top of your,ep097
1074,budget but you know what it came down,ep097
1077,from 879 so it seems like the sellers,ep097
1080,are motivated and I bet you there's a,ep097
1083,chance to get it at a lower price okay,ep097
1086,so let's check it out and say oh wow a,ep097
1089,little bit low I think you definitely,ep097
1092,touch the ceilings it's not all compact,ep097
1095,little claustrophobic I mean I guess,ep097
1098,that's the Cape the compact miss of the,ep097
1101,Cape I don't mind it because I'm 5 feet,ep097
1104,but it does feel very open so the,ep097
1107,kitchen's been updated you could see,ep097
1110,there's granite countertops there's some,ep097
1113,stainless steel appliances,ep097
1116,I like the subway tile I actually missed,ep097
1119,the subway tile because I saw the warm,ep097
1122,wood paneling of the cabinet's so,ep097
1125,professionally it's somehow compromises,ep097
1128,it's a good fit for what we both like,ep097
1131,cuz I don't mind the subway tile is so,ep097
1134,much it has the illusion of being open,ep097
1137,with the blue one over here but I still,ep097
1140,feel kind of cramped in here they check,ep097
1143,out the first-floor bathroom a guest,ep097
1146,bedroom,ep097
1149,and an office that can be turned into,ep097
1152,another bedroom they head upstairs and,ep097
1155,look in on the three guest bedrooms on,ep097
1158,this level in the hall bathroom this is,ep097
1161,the one bathroom up on this level okay,ep097
1164,it's a nice blue color what do you think,ep097
1167,of the blue I should really like it yeah,ep097
1170,it's very calming that's a nice calming,ep097
1173,effect down the hall from the bathroom,ep097
1176,is the master bedroom this is the master,ep097
1179,bedroom because it has a lot of closets,ep097
1182,this outpost has this slanted roof which,ep097
1185,I'm kind of worried about how's your,ep097
1188,head space it's if I'm careful I should,ep097
1191,be okay,ep097
1194,I'm not really sure what to use this,ep097
1197,space for there's not much space to do,ep097
1200,anything other than sustained a,ep097
1203,concussion they head down two flights of,ep097
1206,stairs into the finished basement you,ep097
1209,have a wet bar oh that's a big surprise,ep097
1212,a bar is maybe a little too excessive it,ep097
1215,wouldn't be something that we would use,ep097
1218,a lot in our house I can almost touch my,ep097
1221,head if I'm standing my tippy-toes Oaks,ep097
1224,around the corner it's a bonus room the,ep097
1227,real surprise is it's a sauna what a,ep097
1230,song yes I'm gonna come in oh my god,ep097
1233,[Music],ep097
1236,they take a quick look at the third,ep097
1239,bathroom before heading outside like a,ep097
1242,greenhouse and you have a hot tub oh and,ep097
1245,is that the backyard yes so let's go,ep097
1248,check each other look it's a big yard oh,ep097
1251,my god is that koi pond yes you have a,ep097
1254,koi pond,ep097
1257,oh my god it's pretty cool there's maybe,ep097
1260,the perfect backyard for our to not only,ep097
1263,doesn't have a huge yard but he will,ep097
1266,have a lot of fishy friends overall this,ep097
1269,house is full of surprises there's a lot,ep097
1272,of pros and cons of this house a pros it,ep097
1275,has this amazing backyard but the low,ep097
1278,ceilings I don't want to hit my head on,ep097
1281,a daily basis and really kind of adds to,ep097
1284,the really cramped Austral phobic feel I,ep097
1287,get in the whole place while there's a,ep097
1290,lot of nice amenities it costs a lot to,ep097
1293,keep those amenities up the koi pond the,ep097
1296,hot tub and the sauna it's gonna take a,ep097
1299,conservative money for upkeep I'm not,ep097
1302,sure I like that at all for me it feels,ep097
1305,more spacious it has a ton of rooms but,ep097
1308,perhaps this might be such thing as too,ep097
1311,much house for the two of us plus our,ep097
1314,dog and our bird right it's gonna be a,ep097
1317,really tough decision having seen,ep097
1320,several houses even in Stephanie will,ep097
1323,have to decide what elements are the,ep097
1326,most important an income-producing,ep097
1329,property a big backyard or high ceilings,ep097
1332,our friends our age are already in their,ep097
1335,own dream homes and you know having,ep097
1338,family so where are our priorities,ep097
1341,hey you should go apple picking,ep097
1344,no wait Steven and wife Stephanie have,ep097
1347,been house hunting in Westchester County,ep097
1350,"New York with a max budget of $800,000",ep097
1353,they've seen several options now they,ep097
1356,have to decide I want to start off with,ep097
1359,"the multifamily colonial $720,000 you",ep097
1362,can't be there for three units we'd be,ep097
1365,able to pay off our loans so much faster,ep097
1368,we'd be sacrificing a lot of our privacy,ep097
1371,right yeah that's the multi-family,ep097
1374,that's what we're giving up they'd be,ep097
1377,noisy in the first floor and then you'd,ep097
1380,be making noise for people downstairs,ep097
1383,the kitchens are small yes the rooms are,ep097
1386,small it would be more just for us yeah,ep097
1389,the one with the double porches that,ep097
1392,side colonial that was for $7.99 799,ep097
1395,thousand yes top of our budget,ep097
1398,yeah I really like the Porsches I,ep097
1401,thought it was great I really loved and,ep097
1404,we could definitely grow into that space,ep097
1407,you know we could definitely live there,ep097
1410,for more than 10 years it would be more,ep097
1413,than happy there when next the other,ep097
1416,house was the Cape Cod Spa so seven,ep097
1419,hundred ninety nine thousand this is at,ep097
1422,the top of our budget,ep097
1425,our two would love that backyard it was,ep097
1428,a quarter of an acre what I hated was,ep097
1431,the cost Republic feel and the other,ep097
1434,thing is there was so much cool stuff,ep097
1437,there the sauna the new house yeah that,ep097
1440,takes a lot of money to maintain right,ep097
1443,if something breaks beating all those,ep097
1446,fishies,ep097
1449,yes here the fishes takes cash out of my,ep097
1452,pocket yep so I'm just gonna go and say,ep097
1455,that I've actually made a decision,ep097
1458,really yes I'm a little afraid because I,ep097
1461,have my own land use - okay I think it,ep097
1464,would work out for both of us if we,ep097
1467,chose,ep097
1470,[Music],ep097
1473,the double porch colonial no way really,ep097
1476,yes he was out thinking the same way it,ep097
1479,just felt right I know that it's,ep097
1482,expensive yeah we okay with you know the,ep097
1485,income and investment and choosing the,ep097
1488,lifestyle I kind of splurged a little,ep097
1491,bit I was doing a lot of thinking about,ep097
1494,where we are in our lives and I think,ep097
1497,it's time any of you both deserve it,ep097
1500,right I think we do I think it's,ep097
1503,actually sheet one I am strong like bull,ep097
1506,all right it's an unbelievable feeling,ep097
1509,to live in this home that we can call,ep097
1512,entirely our own so ultimately we chose,ep097
1515,this lifestyle home over an investment,ep097
1518,home and I think we are at this place in,ep097
1521,our lives where we do feel ready and,ep097
1524,this is a decision all or nothing we go,ep097
1527,for it and I think that it's made us,ep097
1530,pretty happy we closed on the house,ep097
1533,about a month ago and then we moved in,ep097
1536,four days ago,ep097
1539,this house was originally listed for,ep097
1542,seven hundred ninety nine thousand we,ep097
1545,"got it for 700 85,000 steve is ecstatic",ep097
1548,than you so hesitant group no no stay,ep097
1551,here I've had the chase around the bird,ep097
1554,already hopefully the bird just stays,ep097
1557,here learned that this is this place the,ep097
1560,boy Archer seems pretty satisfied within,ep097
1563,your space for right now I think he's,ep097
1566,just happy to have a patch of grass to,ep097
1569,call his own,ep097
1572,yes we were surprised recently,ep097
1575,Stephanie's pregnant and this house now,ep097
1578,it's gonna be a little more full and so,ep097
1581,we were very excited that this new,ep097
1584,responsibility of being parents is not,ep097
1587,also complicated by being landlords so,ep097
1590,this single-family home is just right,ep097
1593,for us and this could be your forever,ep097
1596,home with our family yeah this is your,ep097
1599,home,ep097
12,look kind of looking Roos that's so cute,ep098
15,that's something you'd never get in,ep098
18,England after three years in Yorkshire,ep098
21,Ashley can't wait to return to Australia,ep098
24,I grew up on the base and if I can't,ep098
27,wait to show Gemma what ours looked,ep098
30,really like but for his fiance Gemma the,ep098
33,move is a huge risk I'm giving up a,ep098
36,great job great family great friends,ep098
39,we're gonna be newlyweds moving into a,ep098
42,new country,ep098
45,that's a lot of change and there's,ep098
48,something else,ep098
51,Gemma didn't bargain on it turns out I,ep098
54,should I have quite different tastes I,ep098
57,love this house it's got that wings on,ep098
60,this character I want authentic,ep098
63,Australia this is older than my grandma,ep098
66,being there done all that modern stuff,ep098
69,words are just not my style at all I,ep098
72,reckon I can get it,ep098
75,[Music],ep098
78,it has been a huge couple of months,ep098
81,actually I've been planning a wedding we,ep098
84,look stunning stunning and bright don't,ep098
87,forget married we're gonna have a go at,ep098
90,living in Australia that's a lot of,ep098
93,change for a brand-new married couple,ep098
96,this is my turn to have a girl living in,ep098
99,ashes hometown he's been on my turf for,ep098
102,three years now I came over here to play,ep098
105,rugby and my landlord just happened to,ep098
108,be on the board of the local rugby club,ep098
111,when I first met Gemma I thought this is,ep098
114,definitely a chick I wanna get to know,ep098
117,better and it turned out that she was,ep098
120,the one for me now that they're married,ep098
123,Ashley's excited to get back to the,ep098
126,beach I'm busting a gut to get back,ep098
129,there it's gonna be good to go back home,ep098
132,in the UK it's cold it's dark by three,ep098
135,o'clock in the afternoon I have that,ep098
138,childhood connection to Townsend you,ep098
141,don't really get to live on the beach in,ep098
144,New York City so I think it's really,ep098
147,gonna be good for us but with their,ep098
150,savings on the line Gemma's got her,ep098
153,doubts I'll be honest I am fearful of,ep098
156,the move it's not like I'm running away,ep098
159,from something I don't enjoy so I was,ep098
162,thinking the next shoot could be just,ep098
165,sort of along here then you get the,ep098
168,valley in the background right okay,ep098
171,great I have a great job in marketing,ep098
174,for some amazing heritage properties all,ep098
177,every auction and great family great,ep098

186,lived in another country and I've never,ep098
189,even seen Australian I'm gonna be,ep098
192,completely out of my comfort zone we,ep098
195,don't have our jobs lined up yet so it's,ep098
198,a daunting prospect,ep098
201,Australia is all about being laid back,ep098
204,I'm definitely round up a little bit,ep098
207,more tight but I'm hoping the move to,ep098
210,Australia might humming all right let's,ep098
213,do this,ep098
216,Townsville is a busy port city located,ep098
219,on the northeast coast,ep098
222,Australia's Sunshine State Council,ep098
225,"community of about 180,000 people based",ep098
228,on the Ross River it's a great place for,ep098
231,young couples delived it because of,ep098
234,their hot climate,ep098
237,we have Magnetic Island about 20 minute,ep098
240,boat ride away great fishing but the,ep098
243,biggest thing is there's no hustle and,ep098
246,bustle its laid-back great lifestyle and,ep098
249,everyone loves to have a beer here what,ep098
252,are you looking for three or four,ep098
255,bedrooms a nice big yard so we can get,ep098
258,ourself a little puppy we both like the,ep098
261,idea of having a big garden outside,ep098
264,space is really important,ep098
267,I'm stalled behind I actually really,ep098
270,like the Queenslander style I just think,ep098
273,they're really authentic to the region I,ep098
276,grew up in a Queensland I know exactly,ep098
279,what they're all about,ep098
282,they're too old too outdated and Gemma,ep098
285,just moving here I want to try and make,ep098
288,that as least stressful as possible so,ep098
291,we really need to find some of this,ep098
294,gonna be nice and modern and I want an,ep098
297,area fairly really close to the beach as,ep098
300,I like to cool off and go swimming all,ep098
303,the time I'm actually quite keen to be,ep098
306,close to the city,ep098
309,imagine I'm gonna be working in the city,ep098
312,I don't want the big commute um,ep098
315,budget warrants want to spend below 1500,ep098
318,"as much below as we can but 1,500 our",ep098
321,maximum budget we feel so really we've,ep098
324,got two different areas two different,ep098
327,styles of home so you're looking at,ep098
330,modern and obviously close to the water,ep098
333,yeah and then Jamie you're looking for a,ep098
336,within city limits,ep098
339,I'll Queensland install Deki at the back,ep098
342,I think we're gonna see a little bit of,ep098
345,head-butting today but I just want to,ep098
348,see who's gonna come out the winner,ep098
351,thank you I think Gemma might build us,ep098
354,why he's opinionated house one is a,ep098
357,traditional Queenslander that should,ep098
360,appeal to her while meeting Ashley's,ep098
363,need for a large yard oh this reminds me,ep098
366,my family hug back in the old day so,ep098
369,Gemma this is what we call a classic,ep098
372,Queenslander three bed two bath upstairs,ep098
375,downstairs,ep098
378,budget-wise little bit over how much,ep098
381,1730 speak yes but wait till you get,ep098
384,inside and have a look it could be,ep098
387,shuttling that ticks the boxes for you,ep098
390,and half our way away from the city,ep098
393,that's three to four kilometres away,ep098
396,still about 10-15 minutes from the beach,ep098
399,oh yeah it looked depends how fast you,ep098
402,go,ep098
405,oh wow on the doll this place is proper,ep098
408,Aldi it's right up your alley,ep098
411,[Music],ep098
414,it's really unusual it's like nothing I,ep098
417,have ever seen in England that it's,ep098
420,really hot in here where's the aircon,ep098
423,you ever heard of these fans it's a lot,ep098
426,cooler than it was outside Jemma didn't,ep098
429,seem too worried about having no aircon,ep098
432,well I know that we get a little bit,ep098
435,hotter she's gonna dive I'm Jamie all of,ep098
438,this polish staircase yeah beautiful,ep098
441,this is gorgeous I love it this is,ep098
444,exactly what I had in mind what's going,ep098
447,on over here that dining room is tiny,ep098
450,just look at the character in this room,ep098
453,though it's amazing that polished floors,ep098
456,and the gorgeous walls and I like the,ep098
459,slanted roof I just think it's amazing,ep098
462,let's have a look at the kitchen,ep098
465,nice finish is pretty good it does look,ep098
468,a lot smaller than what we used to,ep098
471,window so this is the main bedroom oh,ep098
474,wow this is really nice this is lovely,ep098
477,[Music],ep098
480,really nice breeze coming free back,ep098
483,window really nice I did notice the box,ep098
486,aircon in the corner there mate when,ep098
489,walked in there really noisy I'm not a,ep098
492,big fan of that at least it is aircon,ep098
495,you still got a fan that's right,ep098
498,I really love it I love the high,ep098
501,ceilings and the polished floor this is,ep098
504,exactly what I had in mind but I was,ep098
507,imagining our bedroom in a Queenslander,ep098
510,this is great he dragged me all the way,ep098
513,here from England so I feel like should,ep098
516,have a decent sway in where we,ep098
519,eventually live oh wow it's a pretty,ep098
522,good size see that Jemma that's a mango,ep098
525,tree you would never get that in England,ep098
528,Wow amazing and then to the right you've,ep098
531,got chops so you get your fresh eggs,ep098
534,really yes nice line through that the,ep098
537,garden just just blown me away I could,ep098
540,pick my own lines from a gin and tonic,ep098
543,it's just amazing so really like that,ep098
546,it's the Queen's I know I've been,ep098
549,looking for upstairs it's absolutely,ep098
552,perfect the layout downstairs it throws,ep098
555,me a little bit but I think it's,ep098
558,probably just proves it's nothing like,ep098
561,I've ever seen before,ep098
564,yep this yard is amazing this is,ep098
567,probably my favorite bit I just got a,ep098
570,mango tree a lime tree that's stuff you,ep098
573,just wouldn't have in your gardening,ep098
576,buttons I can get the trunks and the,ep098
579,chicken amazing that's outdoor living,ep098
582,right you can't do that in England I,ep098
585,can't grow my own fruit so for me it,ep098
588,could make a difference between me,ep098
591,wanting to go out over-budget soon as,ep098
594,she walked up in the front door saw,ep098
597,those little cooker bars on the window I,ep098
600,knew that she was,ep098
603,I love this place but it's just not,ep098
606,modern enough for me it doesn't have,ep098
609,aircon throughout and it's just a bit,ep098
612,too steep for what I'm willing to pay,ep098
615,but the location is great I'm really,ep098
618,really happy to be just three or four,ep098
621,kilometers out from the city it's just,ep098
624,too far from the beach it turns out I,ep098
627,should I have quite different taste in,ep098
630,houses which I didn't really expect,ep098
633,someone's gonna have to let something go,ep098
636,not me I think she's got a lot of,ep098
639,whitening so Martin aims for a,ep098
642,compromise this property was Queensland,ep098
645,a character mixed up that modern,ep098
648,interior but Ashley digs in his heels,ep098
651,straight a full kilometres from the city,ep098
654,awesome it's just too far from the beach,ep098
657,[Music],ep098
660,nothing like this though newlyweds Gemma,ep098
663,and Ashley have traded the cold comforts,ep098
666,of Yorkshire England for a more tropical,ep098
669,climate in Townsville Australia I'm,ep098
672,ecstatic to be back in Australia that,ep098
675,was excellent,ep098
678,make your choice yet I grew up on the,ep098
681,beach fishing all the time and I really,ep098
684,want to ever to come be a part of that,ep098
687,that's why we need to live near the,ep098
690,beach to agree to disagree on that one,ep098
693,I'm excited about the prospect of seeing,ep098
696,where he's from okay bye oh you're on,ep098
699,also I feel like a fish out of water,ep098
702,we just gone through a lot of change by,ep098
705,getting married come towards me okay,ep098
708,coming I'm feeling a lot of pressure,ep098
711,right now I've just Musa Ashley's home,ep098
714,country and just left my family behind,ep098
717,like a job just starting a whole new,ep098
720,lifestyle,ep098
723,I'm really gonna help her adjust but I,ep098
726,just hope that the conflict doesn't,ep098
729,stress her out because general likes to,ep098
732,get a bossy boots on that dining room is,ep098
735,fine look at the character in this room,ep098
738,right obviously being newlyweds they're,ep098
741,on that honeymoon period but what I'm,ep098
744,finding there's a bit of tension me it's,ep098
747,just not modern enough for me he dragged,ep098
750,me all the way here from England so I,ep098
753,feel like should have a decent sway and,ep098
756,where we eventually live and how far,ep098
759,away are we from the city that's three,ep098
762,to four kilometers away I imagine I'm,ep098
765,gonna be working in the city I don't,ep098
768,want a big commute the layout downstairs,ep098
771,it throws me a little bit but other than,ep098
774,that it's absolutely perfect it's,ep098
777,definitely not my style,ep098
780,it's still about 10-15 minutes from the,ep098
783,beach and it's just a bit too steep for,ep098
786,what I'm willing to pay someone's gonna,ep098
789,have to let something go not me,ep098
792,I think she's got a lot of lightning so,ep098
795,for house - Martyn finds a happy meeting,ep098
798,then guys this is carriage on straight,ep098
801,or four kilometers from the city awesome,ep098
804,3-bed 2bath you have a sixty-year-old,ep098
807,property so it fits within that,ep098
810,Queensland a character it's just not as,ep098
813,modern as I expected it to be now look,ep098
816,it fits within your budget it's just,ep098
819,"under around 1,400 314 yep so let's get",ep098
822,in and have a good look and see what you,ep098
825,think I love this white picket fence,ep098
828,white picket fences perfect oh wow I,ep098
831,wasn't expecting this I love it,ep098
834,definitely different from the outside,ep098
837,obviously they've done a little bit of,ep098
840,work internally could just be a little,ep098
843,bit small for my liking reminds me of,ep098
846,kind of a little English place I love it,ep098
849,I love the mix of the sort of character,ep098
852,on the outside but then instead of a,ep098
855,modern finish on the inside to the,ep098
858,modern kitchen suits me down to the,ep098
861,ground the modern kitchen is perfect,ep098
864,it's like my dream kitchen it's got the,ep098
867,island it's got an induction hog all,ep098
870,brand-new appliances he literally could,ep098
873,not get any better for me but I think,ep098
876,actually isn't completely sold on this,ep098
879,house so to the left one bedroom well,ep098
882,that's a really good size yeah it's not,ep098
885,too bad up to the right is the main,ep098
888,bathroom this is older than my grandma,ep098
891,come on it's not that old,ep098
894,Wow I'm really surprised actually how,ep098
897,dated this is compared to the rest,ep098
900,this is a bit the only thing that,ep098
903,probably needs to be finished on the,ep098
906,property guys to the left we've got,ep098
909,another bedroom this is exactly what I,ep098
912,expected in the house a lot more modern,ep098
915,up-to-date yeah this is a really,ep098
918,good-size room it'll be great when we,ep098
921,thought family over to stay oh wow this,ep098
924,is nice oh really nice this is the main,ep098
927,bedroom,ep098
930,oh my double showerhead in here that's,ep098
933,lovely,ep098
936,such a nice finish I really like that it,ep098
939,has the casement windows and this,ep098
942,throwing doll is also amazing isn't it,ep098
945,yeah I love it,ep098
948,this could be the compromise that we're,ep098
951,looking for and this is your deck boss,ep098
954,wow this is awesome be perfect for,ep098
957,entertaining having parties and,ep098
960,barbecues here ceiling fans outside is a,ep098
963,good idea as well get that air flowing,ep098
966,around keep Gemma nice and cool in those,ep098
969,hot days yeah that's so odd to have,ep098
972,ceiling fans outside this is tensile,ep098
975,never even thought that you would have a,ep098
978,fan outside because it's certainly not,ep098
981,necessary in England but I can see how,ep098
984,it would be really good for living here,ep098
987,I love this house it's absolutely,ep098
990,perfect for me it's exactly what I'm,ep098
993,looking for I like that it's got a,ep098
996,modern finish on the inside so good for,ep098
999,maintenance and a nice modern kitchen,ep098
1002,but it still got that character of a,ep098
1005,sort of Queens Anton's house match it's,ep098
1008,a bit small for what I'm after but the,ep098
1011,location is great it's not too far out,ep098
1014,of the city,ep098
1017,Gemma just moving here I think she needs,ep098
1020,that closed area to the beach and living,ep098
1023,10-15 minute drive it's just way too far,ep098
1026,he also needs to remember I've made,ep098
1029,quite a big sacrifice to come over here,ep098
1032,so it would be really nice if we could,ep098
1035,have something that really feels,ep098
1038,authentic Australia Gemma was really,ep098
1041,excited about this house but I'm pretty,ep098
1044,sure if I can get her away from that I,ep098
1047,secretly hope that I can get a show over,ep098
1050,the line and this is gonna be the one,ep098
1053,that we live in Ashley finally gets,ep098
1056,everything on his list the 10 minutes,ep098
1059,walk from the beach fits within your,ep098
1062,budget actually this is your modern home,ep098
1065,it's exactly what I want just not my,ep098
1068,style at all but I reckon I can get it,ep098
1071,that's a rock wallaby tiny kangaroo yeah,ep098
1074,they're just miniature versions Ashley,ep098
1077,and Gemma are kicking off married life,ep098
1080,in Townsville Australia I can't wait to,ep098
1083,show Gemma what tampons really like I,ep098
1086,have that childhood connected with,ep098
1089,terrain different animals and I think,ep098
1092,Magnetic Island is gonna be the best,ep098
1095,place to convince them that she's gonna,ep098
1098,love being so close to the beach,ep098
1101,eating straight out of your head oh,ep098
1104,they're so cute I actually cannot,ep098
1107,believe the heat here it's so much,ep098
1110,hotter than I ever imagined living close,ep098
1113,to the beach you're gonna be able to,ep098
1116,cool off and not have the city rut of,ep098
1119,the cars making everything so much,ep098
1122,hotter this is gorgeous and you want to,ep098
1125,live in the town centre do you want to,ep098
1128,be close to the beach I'm just more,ep098
1131,worried about having really long to eat,ep098
1134,practical concerns are never too far,ep098
1137,from Gemma's mind I have a great job,ep098
1140,great family great friends and I have to,ep098
1143,give all that up sir country I've never,ep098
1146,been to and on top of that there's a,ep098
1149,hitch in the home search we tend to have,ep098
1152,completely different tastes the high,ep098
1155,ceilings and the polished floor this is,ep098
1158,exactly what I had in mind when I was,ep098
1161,imagining scream Thunder I want,ep098
1164,authentic Australia although houses one,ep098
1167,and two got high praise from her I love,ep098
1170,the mix of the character and the modern,ep098
1173,finish on the inside he wants modern and,ep098
1176,new and big a little bit small for my,ep098
1179,liking they're missing the mark for him,ep098
1182,this is too far from the beach the,ep098
1185,location is great it's not too far out,ep098
1188,of the city,ep098
1191,I can't maybe hit a little close to the,ep098
1194,beach then Martin hasn't quite met the,ep098
1197,wishlist that I wanted Jim is getting,ep098
1200,her way but he's trying to fight back,ep098
1203,Martin hopes to be the Peacekeeper with,ep098
1206,house three it's closer to the beach for,ep098
1209,Ashley with a modern interior that could,ep098
1212,work for Gemma this used bushland beach,ep098
1215,this is a 3-bed 2bath modern home MA it,ep098
1218,looks awesome 15 minutes away from the,ep098
1221,city centre Gemma not what you wanted,ep098
1224,but ten minutes walk from the beach fits,ep098
1227,"within your budgets about 1,400 a month",ep098
1230,it's exactly what I want excellent oh,ep098
1233,wow look in here I love the high,ep098
1236,ceilings it is a lot more modern then I,ep098
1239,was looking for I do have in my head,ep098
1242,that I want something that feels a,ep098
1245,little bit more authentic Australia I,ep098
1248,think it's awesome I come from a,ep098
1251,Queenslander so I want to get as far,ep098
1254,away from Queenslanders as possible I,ep098
1257,love the open living the,ep098
1260,air-conditioning the high ceilings tile,ep098
1263,floors everything,ep098
1266,say nice and cool yo Gemma really wants,ep098
1269,this authentic Australia which I think,ep098
1272,she thinks he's gonna get out of a,ep098
1275,Queenslander but she's got me and that's,ep098
1278,all she needs,ep098
1281,this kitchen is modern a little bit,ep098
1284,different to what you'll see in a,ep098
1287,Queenslander it's okay I just ideally,ep098
1290,like a little bit bigger but having said,ep098
1293,that I do like that it feeds out into,ep098
1296,the outdoor space so probably really,ep098
1299,good for entertaining and BBQs that kind,ep098
1302,of thing you've also got the breakfast,ep098
1305,spent here we actually can sit and then,ep098
1308,have these breakfasts that you make for,ep098
1311,me no not at all,ep098
1314,so what we've got to the right is,ep098
1317,bedroom to the right again into laundry,ep098
1320,it's nice and Laden yeah come up here a,ep098
1323,little bit further we have my bathroom,ep098
1326,toilet some good-sized rooms look up the,ep098
1329,back here we've got a main bedroom so,ep098
1332,I'll take you through here to the left,ep098
1335,the ensuite bathrooms unusual I love,ep098
1338,having the aircon in the bedroom it's a,ep098
1341,must so we get a good night's sleep I'm,ep098
1344,gonna help Gemma adjust to the,ep098
1347,Townsville lifestyle we're getting as,ep098
1350,much aircon in the house as we can,ep098
1353,possible really make it nice and cool,ep098
1356,and then just keep it so guys this is,ep098
1359,the airport entertaining area fully,ep098
1362,fenced yard,ep098
1365,I like the entertainment space I think,ep098
1368,this is sort of what I had in mind full,ep098
1371,and having friends over and barbecues,ep098
1374,and stuff so it's a good size for that,ep098
1377,and a fenced yard will be really good,ep098
1380,for if we get our dogs this yard is,ep098
1383,awesome shame it's a bit Browns moment,ep098
1386,but that's towns already so I really,ep098
1389,love this modern beach s it's 10 minute,ep098
1392,walk from the beach it's really modern,ep098
1395,on the inside really modern on the,ep098
1398,outside exactly what I'm looking for in,ep098
1401,a house,ep098
1404,it is lovely but it doesn't have the,ep098
1407,character that I'm really looking for,ep098
1410,and it's really far out from the city,ep098
1413,I don't think Jim is quite sold but I,ep098
1416,reckon I can get her there,ep098
1419,it's just not my style I really do enjoy,ep098
1422,that modern beach ass it's perfect for,ep098
1425,what I want it was really really hot,ep098
1428,moving over here and really want to,ep098
1431,compromise beautiful with this it's,ep098
1434,really nice after a 3-year courtship in,ep098
1437,Yorkshire England Ashley and Gemma are,ep098
1440,making the move to his hometown I can't,ep098
1443,wait to get settled in living there it's,ep098
1446,gonna be awesome,ep098
1449,he's hoping Gemma can ease into a more,ep098
1452,laid-back lifestyle in Townsville but,ep098
1455,she sacrificed a lot and has her own,ep098
1458,ideas about what will make the move,ep098
1461,worth why high ceilings and a polished,ep098
1464,floor this is exactly what I had in mind,ep098
1467,and that garden was just available it's,ep098
1470,a good-sized yard and the house is large,ep098
1473,but it's not something that suits me,ep098
1476,definitely not that modern feel that I'm,ep098
1479,really looking for there's way over,ep098
1482,budget I like this I love the mix of the,ep098
1485,character on the outside but there's a,ep098
1488,modern finish on the inside just a,ep098
1491,little bit small for my liking it was,ep098
1494,under budget still too far from the,ep098
1497,beach the modern beach house was right,ep098
1500,up my alley,ep098
1503,ten minutes walk from the beach put in,ep098
1506,"your budgets we have 1,400 a month it's",ep098
1509,exactly what I want it's just really not,ep098
1512,what I had in mind at all modern is,ep098
1515,exactly what you can get in England and,ep098
1518,it's really far out from the city,ep098
1521,[Music],ep098
1524,I can't believe how stressful this has,ep098
1527,been moving over here and looking at all,ep098
1530,these different houses they're all got,ep098
1533,so much to offer it it has been really,ep098
1536,really hard I think we really need to,ep098
1539,rule the house up yeah I think it would,ep098
1542,make the decision easier I'm thinking,ep098
1545,it's got to be the classic green thunder,ep098
1548,just because even though the yards,ep098
1551,amazing and it's a really good size I,ep098
1554,just don't think it's a good idea to go,ep098
1557,over budget at the state,ep098
1560,I totally agree I know it was the,ep098
1563,biggest house with the biggest yard but,ep098
1566,we definitely don't have the money to be,ep098
1569,spending yet so that leaves us with two,ep098
1572,yeah well you know which one's my,ep098
1575,favorite I love that small Queens on,ep098
1578,there I really do I like the combination,ep098
1581,of the Queensland style plus the modern,ep098
1584,fittings and the location is so great I,ep098
1587,could tell you that one but I really do,ep098
1590,enjoy that modern beach house it's,ep098
1593,perfect for I want the air conditioning,ep098
1596,the big yard entertaining area I think,ep098
1599,it's exactly what we need,ep098
1602,being so close to the beach in that Jeep,ep098
1605,that was a big sell for me but the,ep098
1608,location is an ideal for me I don't,ep098
1611,really want to be commuting too far and,ep098
1614,that's more Queens under been so close,ep098
1617,to the city would leave us a lot more,ep098
1620,free time to be enjoying the Aussie,ep098
1623,lifestyle but I know how much you want,ep098
1626,that one beach house,ep098
1629,[Applause],ep098
1632,well I didn't drag you halfway across,ep098
1635,the world to make you live in a place,ep098
1638,that you don't love and I know you,ep098
1641,really love that small Queenslander so I,ep098
1644,think that's one we should take,ep098
1647,can't believe you're willing to,ep098
1650,compromise that much you sure I'm,ep098
1653,definitely sure we can always drive to,ep098
1656,the beach and I want you to be happy we,ep098
1659,need to start brainstorming and some of,ep098
1662,the top things to do in Townsville as,ep098
1665,newlyweds I do feel like it was a pretty,ep098
1668,brave steps to immediately move overseas,ep098
1671,but we've both got jobs that we're,ep098
1674,really happy with I'm working for the,ep098
1677,local tourism organization doing some,ep098
1680,marketing and I'm starting to come along,ep098
1683,as a good personal trainer feet shoulder,ep098
1686,width apart chest up back straight yeah,ep098
1689,just let your ass swing so we're happy,ep098
1692,with our decision to move to your town,ep098
1695,salts or just gym I absolutely love well,ep098
1698,everything about this home to be honest,ep098
1701,I love the modern fishings on the inside,ep098
1704,and having friends over on the deck he's,ep098
1707,just awesome yeah we please so - and,ep098
1710,then we've got enough room in the garden,ep098
1713,froderick as well Joey sit,ep098
1716,okay I'm still not a big fan of the,ep098
1719,outside and I still want that closer,ep098
1722,house to the beat but she makes me happy,ep098
1725,type compromised it was a big change,ep098
1728,moving over here from England but I love,ep098
1731,the Aussie lifestyle I don't miss me in,ep098
1734,cooped everything,ep098
12,any from here newlyweds Kevin and Lee,ep099
15,are off to Townsville Australia we've,ep099
18,only been married for a week so I guess,ep099
21,the move to Australia is like a,ep099
24,honeymoon Kevin's getting his PhD in,ep099
27,marine biology I'm more excited about,ep099
30,the movement Lee studying Great Barrier,ep099
33,Reef is kind of the marine biology dream,ep099
36,after giving up her job to make Kevin's,ep099
39,dream come true,ep099
42,we has certain expectations about life,ep099
45,down under because we just got married,ep099
48,really hoping we can get something that,ep099
51,feels more grown-up wow this kitchen is,ep099
54,"huge so 1,100 per month not too bad I",ep099
57,feel pressure to stick to the thousand,ep099
60,dollar budget that we set out oh this is,ep099
63,amazing,ep099
66,[Music],ep099
69,[Music],ep099
72,we're at home right now I'll be able to,ep099
75,see with our eyes we'd be head to toe in,ep099
78,snow suits we actually met online and on,ep099
81,our first date I learned that Jeff was,ep099
84,planning to study marine biology and I,ep099
87,thought okay I have one story about when,ep099
90,I was stepped on a sea urchin and how,ep099
93,much I hate them and then I asked him so,ep099
96,what are you gonna study for your,ep099
99,masters and he said I'm gonna study sea,ep099
102,urchins I can't wait to see the views if,ep099
105,we make it to the top yeah pick,ep099
108,Townsville because I can get out there,ep099
111,and get my hands on some sharks and,ep099
114,stingrays every month I think the view,ep099
117,is gonna be worth it oh whoa well here,ep099
120,we are I've been a registered nurse for,ep099
123,five years,ep099
126,and I'm having to give that job up to,ep099
129,move to Australia which has been really,ep099
132,tough I think the university is,ep099
135,somewhere just over there is past as,ep099
138,hell should we go check it out yeah I,ep099
141,think we should even though Kaz has a,ep099
144,little bit of money coming in from his,ep099
147,scholarship I don't have a job lined up,ep099
150,at all and it's a little bit concerning,ep099
153,when we're making this big move overseas,ep099
156,are we still on campus or did we drive,ep099
159,out of it I kind of feel like we're out,ep099
162,in the middle of the outback all right,ep099
165,home to some of the world's leading,ep099
168,experts in marine biology maybe that'll,ep099
171,be you someday yeah I hope so,ep099
174,we don't know all that much about,ep099
177,Townsville we know it's quite a bit,ep099
180,smaller than Winnipeg I've had this,ep099
183,vision in my head that it's beautiful,ep099
186,beaches and really cool place to live,ep099
189,Tan's Belize the capital of North,ep099
192,Queensland we got beaches close Islands,ep099
195,we've got everything that you could want,ep099
198,here weather beautiful tropical very,ep099
201,laid-back you can get anywhere in 20,ep099
204,minutes it's a place to be the kind of,ep099
207,people that love to live in counsel,ep099
210,people that like the Great Barrier Reef,ep099
213,for our oceans because it's so close we,ep099
216,have a big University so the people that,ep099
219,like to be here normally around at a,ep099
222,younger generation love being outdoors,ep099
225,enjoying the tropical weather we're,ep099
228,looking to renting apartments yeah and,ep099
231,we definitely want a two-bedroom doing,ep099
234,two baths one bar one bathroom is fine,ep099
237,okay um area Wars where are you looking,ep099
240,for then we go into the university every,ep099
243,day so some are close by with a short,ep099
246,commute would be really convenient for,ep099
249,me it would be really nice to be close,ep099
252,to the beach otherwise that's another,ep099
255,good thing yeah is anything else that,ep099
258,you're looking for I guess from a next,ep099
261,want to be a nice outdoor space we had a,ep099
264,ground-floor unit with a patio or,ep099
267,someone were the balcony because you,ep099
270,want to be able to barbecue yeah,ep099
273,wouldn't mind a more kind of modern,ep099
276,kitchen would be really nice and I,ep099
279,definitely wouldn't say no to a pool in,ep099
282,this hot weather budget goes what are,ep099
285,you looking from a budget point of view,ep099
288,our budget is a thousand dollars a month,ep099
291,yeah I think we could go a little bit,ep099
294,more to get a nicer place if we could,ep099
297,have a bit of wiggle around we don't,ep099
300,need too much extra so we really like to,ep099
303,stay at a thousand dollars if we can I,ep099
306,kind I think it should be fairly easy to,ep099
309,find a job so we could go over a little,ep099
312,bit Kevin and Lee want to leave all,ep099
315,right where the universities or,ep099
318,somewhere near the water,ep099
321,this is Lee's picked this is near the,ep099
324,water so it's about 15 20 minutes to the,ep099
327,University but with what Lee wants it's,ep099
330,five minutes from the city couple of,ep099
333,minutes from the water area I love all,ep099
336,these trees and nice and close to the,ep099
339,water but I think it might be a little,ep099
342,far from the Uni it wouldn't hurt to,ep099
345,ride the BOC would it back and forth,ep099
348,hey so I think I'd be a puddle of sweat,ep099
351,by the time I got there I wouldn't need,ep099
354,to go to the gym then this is the modern,ep099
357,unit that you're looking for this,ep099
360,apartment has two bed one bath the pool,ep099
363,excellent what's the price of this unit,ep099
366,"a little bit over budget so it's 1,100",ep099
369,per month,ep099
372,not too bad it's a bit more than I was,ep099
375,hoping for even though Lee has some,ep099
378,savings and is willing to dip into them,ep099
381,I feel bad,ep099
384,dipping into her savings and not,ep099
387,contributing too much look it's really,ep099
390,nice what's the space I like this,ep099
393,countertop here this parts a little bit,ep099
396,squishy though like yeah we can we can,ep099
399,even cuddle and cook on the stove here,ep099
402,yeah I like the big windows yeah also I,ep099
405,got the patio coming in and have a look,ep099
408,at these oh wow what a view,ep099
411,sure beats our parking lot we had to,ep099
414,look over my bag we couldn't even go,ep099
417,outside we didn't have the balcony it's,ep099
420,a good size you could definitely put the,ep099
423,barbecue like right here yeah it's gonna,ep099
426,go barbecue table out here,ep099
429,oh wow it's a really good size I really,ep099
432,like how big the room is not too crazy,ep099
435,about the view yeah we're looking at a,ep099
438,kind of dirt wall the greenery is nice,ep099
441,though yeah this is pretty nice Oh a,ep099
444,nice big mirror here there's not a lot,ep099
447,of countertop space but I mean it's,ep099
450,functional it's got a bathtub I wasn't a,ep099
453,huge fan of the bathroom I think I could,ep099
456,live with it but it might get a little,ep099
459,bit crowded is the correct term I don't,ep099
462,even have that much stuff do you leave,ep099
465,it on the counter though it looks like a,ep099
468,lot we really like the living area it's,ep099
471,a big area in this space the master,ep099
474,bedroom was really big lots of space for,ep099
477,our furniture all of the rooms are good,ep099
480,size we really like the layout it's,ep099
483,pretty modern and of course the balcony,ep099
486,we're just minutes from the beach and,ep099
489,all the shops that's really nice,ep099
492,kitchens a little bit cramped but we,ep099
495,might be able to make it work I am a,ep099
498,little bit concerned about how far it is,ep099
501,away from the University and it's also a,ep099
504,bit over the budget that we are hoping,ep099
507,to spend so yeah but we don't want to,ep099
510,rule it out quite yet the area is,ep099
513,amazing it's so close to the beach it's,ep099
516,really kind of where everything is,ep099
519,happening I really liked it it's close,ep099
522,to everything except for the University,ep099
525,and I'd like to look at a place that's,ep099
528,more within our budget,ep099
531,how far away is this one from the city,ep099
534,this one's about 20 minutes away from,ep099
537,the city if we look if we look from the,ep099
540,side the university saw it about five,ep099
543,minutes oh that's perfect Kevin gets his,ep099
546,preferred location but Lee pushes back,ep099
549,furnitures a bit plain couch is a bit,ep099
552,worn out I guess that's why it's under,ep099
555,budget,ep099
558,I'm excited to live somewhere that,ep099
561,finally has an aquarium yeah let's go,ep099
564,find some rays for you Kevin and Leigh,ep099
567,have come to Townsville Australia so,ep099
570,that Kevin can get his PhD in marine,ep099
573,biology I'm more excited about the move,ep099
576,to Australia than Lee studying sharks,ep099
579,and stingrays the Great Barrier Reef is,ep099
582,kind of the marine biology dream we've,ep099
585,got a blue spotted Lagoon right just,ep099
588,hiding in the corner over there at the,ep099
591,moment she's an absolute beauty yeah,ep099
594,just came to town so I'm doing my PhD,ep099
597,studying race at jcu oh that's fantastic,ep099
600,but since she's given up her career back,ep099
603,in Canada to make the move happen he's,ep099
606,not ready to compromise on what she,ep099
609,wants in a new home keV just expects to,ep099
612,get an abode and go do research,ep099
615,whereas I expect more to be able to live,ep099
618,somewhere that's close to the beach and,ep099
621,relax this is so cool this is really and,ep099
624,so far the house Hunt has been kinder to,ep099
627,lead city was about four units a strange,ep099
630,bit a minute or two a wide area is,ep099
633,amazing it's so close to the beach and,ep099
636,all the shops it's really kind of where,ep099
639,everything is happening I really liked,ep099
642,it it's close to everything except for,ep099
645,the University look great oh this is,ep099
648,amazing,ep099
651,I don't think the fact that it was over,ep099
654,budget was really that big of a deal how,ep099
657,do you feel about it and I'd really like,ep099
660,to stay within the thousand dollars that,ep099
663,we were planning to spend originally,ep099
666,luckily there's a giant shovel nose,ep099
669,right there oh look so weird with house,ep099
672,- Martin focuses more on Kevin's wish,ep099
675,list so Kevin this property is actually,ep099
678,gonna match what he's looking for,ep099
681,it's five minutes from the Uni so maybe,ep099
684,a 10-minute bike ride for him nearly she,ep099
687,wants to be where the action is strain,ep099
690,the water that's about 20 minutes away,ep099
693,how far away is this one from the city,ep099
696,about 20 minutes away from the city if,ep099
699,we look if we look from the say the,ep099
702,university side about five minutes,ep099
705,perfect here's the building this is to,ep099
708,bed one bath and a large courtyard okay,ep099
711,now it's a ground-floor you there yes it,ep099
714,is yes also has a pool up to on the left,ep099
717,as well oh I'm happy to hear that what's,ep099
720,the price of this units there's no,ep099
723,$100.00 per my house,ep099
726,he's a little hesitant about the,ep099
729,location of this unit because it's quite,ep099
732,far away from the city I want somewhere,ep099
735,"that falls at $1,000 a month the school",ep099
738,to the University to make my commute,ep099
741,really easy living area is awesome it's,ep099
744,so big furniture is a bit plain couch is,ep099
747,a bit worn out I guess that's why it's,ep099
750,under budget I really like the kitchen,ep099
753,this is a nice big countertop these,ep099
756,appliances look new to ya oh the,ep099
759,cupboard space we have I mean this,ep099
762,happens a bit small yeah yeah a little,ep099
765,bit narrow I don't know if we'd fit a,ep099
768,big roasting pan in there,ep099
771,I definitely think Kevin likes this,ep099
774,place more than me it's close to the,ep099
777,University and if it were up to him he'd,ep099
780,move in there tomorrow I'm a little bit,ep099
783,apprehensive of how far away it is to,ep099
786,the beach it's a bit small is this the,ep099
789,main bedroom,ep099
792,cities I don't think you'd be able to,ep099
795,fit any other storage or anything in,ep099
798,here oh you've got Hilton wardrobe in,ep099
801,there so he sounds good that's good I,ep099
804,don't mind the view,ep099
807,you got nice hills and trees back there,ep099
810,that's right on that main road traffic,ep099
813,going by and he's the bathroom oh okay,ep099
816,yeah the bathrooms not bad yeah it looks,ep099
819,pretty nice not a lot of counter space,ep099
822,got some nice cupboards and can fit some,ep099
825,more stuff in there these are wall,ep099
828,fixtures I mean they don't feel like,ep099
831,they're on that well like careful we,ep099
834,were barely in there for a minute you're,ep099
837,already breaking the place this backyard,ep099
840,is huge you got this nice patio over,ep099
843,here you got a barbecue which is,ep099
846,fantastic where's the pool up here on,ep099
849,you're all about a hundred meters away,ep099
852,Oh excellent what do you think I really,ep099
855,like the location it's quite close to,ep099
858,school ekta bike there in couple minutes,ep099
861,and the living area is quite big,ep099
864,bedrooms are a bit small and some of the,ep099
867,furniture was a little bit worn out,ep099
870,definitely like the modern kitchen and,ep099
873,this living space outside is really nice,ep099
876,but I'm a bit concerns that it's so,ep099
879,close to this main road and it is really,ep099
882,far away for,ep099
885,the beachy kind of all those main shops,ep099
888,we both really love the outdoor space,ep099
891,where we can put the barbecue but we,ep099
894,definitely are disagreeing on the,ep099
897,location,ep099
900,keval be so busy with his studies and,ep099
903,I'm coming here new not really knowing,ep099
906,anyone still looking for a job so it,ep099
909,might be really nice to have something,ep099
912,to go and do while he's studying so the,ep099
915,apartment gonna go and see near about 15,ep099
918,minutes away from the city 20 minutes,ep099
921,away from where the university is okay,ep099
924,it's not really close to either no it's,ep099
927,not 9:00,ep099
930,House 3 is location puts Kevin and Lee,ep099
933,off but the interior realz them right,ep099
936,back in this kitchen is huge never run,ep099
939,in a storage space in here now this is,ep099
942,what I call a nice modern kitchen think,ep099
945,Martin was like hella called wood oh so,ep099
948,much Kevin and Lee are starting their,ep099
951,lives as husband and wife in Townsville,ep099
954,Australia so Kevin can get a PhD in,ep099
957,marine biology we've only been married,ep099
960,for a week so I guess this moved to,ep099
963,Australia is like a honeymoon moving to,ep099
966,Townsville was financially it's,ep099
969,stressful and then finding a new job and,ep099
972,the place to live there's all these,ep099
975,things that take into play for moving to,ep099
978,another country house one was a serious,ep099
981,contender for lead but made Kevin a,ep099
984,little nervous about the cost so what,ep099
987,did you think of that place by the,ep099
990,Strand oh that was so nice cities about,ep099
993,5 minutes strain and the beach is about,ep099
996,a minute or it's so close to the beach,ep099
999,and all of the shops it's really kind of,ep099
1002,where everything's happening I really,ep099
1005,liked it,ep099
1008,looking over that marina that was,ep099
1011,beautiful I really love the view on that,ep099
1014,balcony,ep099
1017,I don't think the fact that it was over,ep099
1020,budget was really that big of a deal I,ep099
1023,feel pressure to stick to the thousand,ep099
1026,dollar budget that we set out and I want,ep099
1029,to live really close to university you,ep099
1032,really liked that apartment by the,ep099
1035,university yeah I did this living area,ep099
1038,is awesome it's so big,ep099
1041,a bit plain big fan of the price,ep099
1044,something under budget that close the,ep099
1047,university I don't know if we'll be able,ep099
1050,to do much better than that no it just,ep099
1053,seems like it should be even more under,ep099
1056,budget if it's that far away from town,ep099
1059,it's just a 10-minute bike ride every,ep099
1062,day that's nothing,ep099
1065,if we put that apartment closer to the,ep099
1068,city she would want to move in in a,ep099
1071,heartbeat but I'm really happy with how,ep099
1074,close it is to the University because,ep099
1077,it'll make my life so much easier,ep099
1080,hey I heard that there might be a scuba,ep099
1083,shop around here maybe we should check,ep099
1086,that out oh yeah I think Kevin's really,ep099
1089,excited about the move I know she can't,ep099
1092,wait to get going and studying on the,ep099
1095,Great Barrier Reef but I know he's,ep099
1098,really anxious about how I feel we came,ep099
1101,over here because I got a PhD position,ep099
1104,at the University and I really wanted to,ep099
1107,be happy with where we're living yeah,ep099
1110,that's the one so she can settle in and,ep099
1113,be more comfortable if there's something,ep099
1116,that she really really loves and it's a,ep099
1119,bit further away I'll probably need to,ep099
1122,compromise Kevin Lee are looking for I,ep099
1125,guess two different locations Lee wants,ep099
1128,something that's in the city where Kevin,ep099
1131,wants something that's close to the,ep099
1134,University so this property is sits in,ep099
1137,the middle so the apart we're gonna go,ep099
1140,and see now about 15 minutes away from,ep099
1143,the city 20 minutes away from where the,ep099
1146,university is no it's not and about 20,ep099
1149,minutes away from the beach that is a,ep099
1152,bit far out from the beach yeah it does,ep099
1155,kind of feel like a homey neighborhood,ep099
1158,though so here we are okay is it the,ep099
1161,ground floor the top floor you like,ep099
1164,grain floor to bed one bath does this,ep099
1167,one have a pool no it doesn't there's no,ep099
1170,"pool here it's 1,100 per month yeah it",ep099
1173,might be a bit much it's not that much,ep099
1176,over budget what's going to have a look,ep099
1179,all right this looks really modern seems,ep099
1182,really homey,ep099
1185,quite large too I really like the,ep099
1188,windows get lots of natural light in,ep099
1191,here too furniture is actually really,ep099
1194,nice wow this kitchen is huge look at,ep099
1197,all the covers oh never run out of,ep099
1200,storage space in here now this is what I,ep099
1203,call a nice modern kitchen oh here we go,ep099
1206,it might be a little bit small it's not,ep099
1209,that big is it it's not a lot of room,ep099
1212,for anything else than what's already in,ep099
1215,here yeah I wouldn't get much furniture,ep099
1218,in here,ep099
1221,really not a lot of space in here really,ep099
1224,tiny countertops pretty small and,ep099
1227,there's not a lot of storage in here,ep099
1230,it's really not that big of a bathroom,ep099
1233,shower looks really nice though I think,ep099
1236,I was more concerned about how small the,ep099
1239,bathroom was he thought it didn't really,ep099
1242,matter as much oh wow I haven't see art,ep099
1245,is huge this is a cute little table yeah,ep099
1248,I really like the flow from the kitchen,ep099
1251,right out onto the patio this would be a,ep099
1254,great place to eat meals together yeah,ep099
1257,definitely why don't we share this yard,ep099
1260,okay yes you do so obviously the,ep099
1263,balconies upstairs but you've got all,ep099
1266,down here so who does all the yard work,ep099
1269,then body is by me okay what do you,ep099
1272,think of the whole place I mean first,ep099
1275,impressions walking in it was WOW,ep099
1278,like this is really modern looks like,ep099
1281,it's been totally redone everything,ep099
1284,looks brand-new it's really nowhere near,ep099
1287,the University and it's still quite a,ep099
1290,bit far from the beach too and a little,ep099
1293,bit further from town than I think I'd,ep099
1296,like it to be I think you would like it,ep099
1299,if it maybe had a pool too yeah there's,ep099
1302,no pool here and it is over budget I can,ep099
1305,see why Martin brought us here it's a,ep099
1308,really modern unit and it's got a lot of,ep099
1311,the interior features that we were,ep099
1314,looking for price of this unit is a,ep099
1317,little bit more than we want to spend,ep099
1320,that much over budget though,ep099
1323,but for somewhere that's far from the,ep099
1326,University and also far from the beach,ep099
1329,not sure if we'd be worth it if we got,ep099
1332,the one by the beach would be so close,ep099
1335,all the restaurants and shopping areas I,ep099
1338,think we might be thinking a little bit,ep099
1341,like tourists wanting to live close to,ep099
1344,the beach and the attractive area of,ep099
1347,town where we really should be thinking,ep099
1350,about something that's gonna be,ep099
1353,convenient for our everyday lives this,ep099
1356,is so crazy I think we can just come,ep099
1359,down and go for a walk along the ocean,ep099
1362,Kevin and Lee came to Townsville so,ep099
1365,Kevin could study marine biology but Lee,ep099
1368,isn't about to give up on what she wants,ep099
1371,out of Australia keV just a,ep099
1374,to get an abode and go do research,ep099
1377,whereas I expect more to be able to live,ep099
1380,somewhere that's close to the beach and,ep099
1383,relax,ep099
1386,I'd really like to stick with the budget,ep099
1389,we could dip into lee's savings but i'd,ep099
1392,rather save that and live really close,ep099
1395,to university what did you think about,ep099
1398,the one by the beach,ep099
1401,I liked that one I mean the view over,ep099
1404,the water was great such a great I,ep099
1407,really loved the view on that balcony,ep099
1410,it's so close to the beach and all the,ep099
1413,shops I really liked it although it did,ep099
1416,come in over our budget I'd really like,ep099
1419,to stay within the thousand dollars that,ep099
1422,we were planning to spend originally,ep099
1425,what did you think about the one by the,ep099
1428,University I really like that one I mean,ep099
1431,really convenient to get to school it's,ep099
1434,living areas awesome furnitures a bit,ep099
1437,plain I'm really happy about how close,ep099
1440,it is to the University because it'll,ep099
1443,make my life so much easier yeah came in,ep099
1446,under budget $900 a month that's true,ep099
1449,was definitely under our budget I don't,ep099
1452,know it just seems like it should be,ep099
1455,even more under budget if it's that far,ep099
1458,away from town,ep099
1461,just think of that really modern one,ep099
1464,that looks like it been recently redone,ep099
1467,that was beautiful I really like that,ep099
1470,one it's really hoping the concept seems,ep099
1473,really homey quite large - I was really,ep099
1476,blown away when we first walked in it's,ep099
1479,so modern the living area is fantastic,ep099
1482,has this a really natural flow to it and,ep099
1485,feels like a home already it's just,ep099
1488,walking in there's nice and big you guys,ep099
1491,have a patio and barbecue back there,ep099
1494,friends but we're sharing it with the,ep099
1497,upstairs neighbors it's not close to the,ep099
1500,beach,ep099
1503,and it's not close to the University and,ep099
1506,"it came in at $1,100 if you put it by",ep099
1509,the beach I'd be ready to move in and if,ep099
1512,you plopped it down by the university,ep099
1515,keV would be ready to move in so I'm,ep099
1518,just not really sure if the location,ep099
1521,makes sense for us but the property just,ep099
1524,blew us away,ep099
1527,[Music],ep099
1530,that really modern ones really not close,ep099
1533,to the beach or the University and it's,ep099
1536,hundred dollars over a budget,ep099
1539,yeah I'm really not sure if it's worth,ep099
1542,going over our budget yeah I agree,ep099
1545,despite how much we really love the,ep099
1548,interior I think I'd probably eliminate,ep099
1551,that one yeah let's do that so there's,ep099
1554,two left we've got the one by the,ep099
1557,University and we've got the one by the,ep099
1560,beach what do you think I think we,ep099
1563,should take the one by the beach that,ep099
1566,one was nice but how often are we really,ep099
1569,gonna go to the beach the one by the,ep099
1572,university would be convenient for,ep099
1575,everyday life but if we took the one by,ep099
1578,the beach we could come walk down here,ep099
1581,all the time have a nice glass of wine,ep099
1584,on that patio the one by the beach is,ep099
1587,$100 a month over budget yeah it is a,ep099
1590,little bit over budget but it wasn't,ep099
1593,that much over budget I think we might,ep099
1596,be thinking a little bit like tourists,ep099
1599,wanting to live close to the beach and,ep099
1602,the attractive area of town where we,ep099
1605,really should be thinking about,ep099
1608,something that's gonna be convenient for,ep099
1611,our everyday lives,ep099
1614,and hey the pool oh I did love that pool,ep099
1617,you're probably gonna make better use of,ep099
1620,the pool and the one by the university,ep099
1623,than the one by the beach if we got the,ep099
1626,one by the beach would be so close to,ep099
1629,all the restaurants and shopping areas I,ep099
1632,just think being by the beach,ep099
1635,might not really be as important as we,ep099
1638,think it is we're not gonna be going to,ep099
1641,the beach every day I think we should go,ep099
1644,for the one by the University but I want,ep099
1647,you to be happy so I throw it to you,ep099
1650,whichever one you want I did really love,ep099
1653,that pool plus we'd have that extra,ep099
1656,money to really explore Australia so,ep099
1659,yeah let's get the one by the University,ep099
1662,that's it yeah awesome we found our home,ep099
1665,[Music],ep099
1668,hey how's your day good we really love,ep099
1671,Townsville there's so much to do that's,ep099
1674,close by you've done six dives since,ep099
1677,we've been here put up the Great Barrier,ep099
1680,Reef I ordered us taster Potter of beers,ep099
1683,that they make in have a serious awesome,ep099
1686,life here feels completely different,ep099
1689,from Winnipeg when we first came over we,ep099
1692,were really worried about finances but,ep099
1695,I've been able to get a job at a,ep099
1698,hospital that's only a 10-minute Drive,ep099
1701,away and now that Lee has a job we have,ep099
1704,that extra amount of money that we can,ep099
1707,go and just keep exploring Australia,ep099
1710,yeah I keep scuba diving the sausages,ep099
1713,are almost done Oh perfect my favorite,ep099
1716,things about our new apartment,ep099
1719,our patio in the backyard I absolutely,ep099
1722,love being able to barbecue and I really,ep099
1725,love being so close to the University I,ep099
1728,can bike there in under ten minutes I,ep099
1731,just can't believe there's palm trees I,ep099
1734,know it's so relaxing a week before we,ep099
1737,moved to towns when we got married which,ep099
1740,was a huge event at our lives,ep099
1743,yeah and moving over here it's like,ep099
1746,being a tropical paradise so there was,ep099
1749,really no need for a honeymoon yeah it,ep099
1752,just feels like we're on a honey,ep099
12,for the power in the family after years,ep100
15,of persuasion from his wife Courtney,ep100
18,Dave Moke has agreed to uproot himself,ep100
21,and his family from their comfortable,ep100
24,lives in Glen Mills Pennsylvania who's,ep100
27,gonna be the winner to live in Rome,ep100
30,Italy who's gonna be the loser the clash,ep100
33,will be over whether to live like a true,ep100
36,Roman I would really like to downsize in,ep100
39,a small City apartment,ep100
42,could you imagine cooking Thanksgiving,ep100
45,dinner in here no I couldn't I think it,ep100
48,may be a tougher transition than you,ep100
51,think,ep100
54,downsizing that much or to return to a,ep100
57,big house in the suburbs,ep100
60,I need some space for myself like,ep100
63,Americans this is the space that I was,ep100
66,looking the elevator that means the,ep100
69,house is too big,ep100
72,[Applause],ep100
75,[Music],ep100
78,[Music],ep100
81,I've been playing hockey since high,ep100
84,school,ep100
87,current team that I'm playing with when,ep100
90,we become really tight and you've spent,ep100
93,a lot of time together just having a,ep100
96,good time doing an international move,ep100
99,has been something I've been really,ep100
102,trying to convince Dave to do first,ep100
105,several years now so really I'm gonna,ep100
108,miss the camaraderie and the friendships,ep100
111,that I've made with these guys he really,ep100
114,wasn't open to the idea but I think I,ep100
117,kept persisting and working on him this,ep100
120,is it for me,ep100
123,there's no hockey in Rome so definitely,ep100
126,is something that I know I'm gonna miss,ep100
129,we'll miss you buddy,ep100
132,so I need to figure out what I can do to,ep100
135,kind of fill that void I think you're,ep100
138,gonna be able to do this in Italy I,ep100
141,haven't moved around much so this type,ep100
144,of move is pretty dramatic when an,ep100
147,international job opportunity came up in,ep100
150,her company Cortney saw her chance to,ep100
153,broaden her family's horizons especially,ep100
156,her kids impressive her photo,ep100
159,it's an opportunity for them to open up,ep100
162,things I never even knew about as I was,ep100
165,growing up it's just gonna be an,ep100
168,incredible adventure the kids and I are,ep100
171,definitely a little hesitant for this,ep100
174,move just because we're giving up what,ep100
177,we know our activities our friends our,ep100
180,family it's gonna be a big change,ep100
183,Rome it's amazing it's like a movie and,ep100
186,can give you so many different emotion,ep100
189,just walking around and see what you,ep100
192,have all around you a lot of people,ep100
195,wants to move here and leave the,ep100
198,experience of Rome it's like do you want,ep100
201,to read a book or you can visit Rome,ep100
204,just to the score in the history we're,ep100
207,talking about thousands of years like,ep100
210,the Pantheon and the Piazza Navona like,ep100
213,so much history behind I would love to,ep100
216,take this opportunity to really downsize,ep100
219,and see what it's like living in a,ep100
222,smaller space the apartment scares me a,ep100
225,little bit um after living years in a,ep100
228,larger home downsizing to an apartment,ep100
231,with a lot of shared space might give me,ep100
234,a little anxiety we really would like to,ep100
237,have three to four bedrooms we hope to,ep100
240,have lots of visitors so having that,ep100
243,fourth bedroom will be really nice for,ep100
246,us the other thing to think about is one,ep100
249,outdoor space preferably with a garden,ep100
252,we want to have enough space where we're,ep100
255,not feeling cramped me having three,ep100
258,girls in the house plus the dog I need,ep100
261,some some space for myself at times and,ep100
264,I don't want to lose that and what's,ep100
267,your budget,ep100
270,"oh the budget is a max of $4,300 a month",ep100
273,going from two salaries to one initially,ep100
276,it's important that we don't go over the,ep100
279,budget house one lines up nicely with,ep100
282,Courtney's dream of downsizing downtown,ep100
285,this apartment can be a good option for,ep100
288,them to enjoy the daily Roman lifestyle,ep100
291,in a central area it's a really nice,ep100
294,area very residential okay it's a three,ep100
297,bedroom apartment with two bathroom,ep100
300,there is a little private patio in the,ep100
303,backyard I'm night and it's fully,ep100
306,furnished ooh I'd love to be in the city,ep100
309,where we can walk to restaurants and,ep100
312,pubs walk around the corner to get,ep100
315,gelato the monthly price is three,ep100
318,thousand and five hundred dollars per,ep100
321,coin the price is great,ep100
324,welcome very nice this is actually a,ep100
327,little bigger than I was expecting and,ep100
330,it's quite open yeah so is this the only,ep100
333,living area yes it is now we're going to,ep100
336,the kitchen oh the store doesn't even,ep100
339,open all the way that's right into the,ep100
342,fridge yeah okay this is very small well,ep100
345,you did want to downsize,ep100
348,could you imagine cooking Thanksgiving,ep100
351,dinner in here no I couldn't we had 12,ep100
354,people over it's just not possible,ep100
357,yeah but I do really like the cabinet's,ep100
360,I like how there is sort of shabby chic,ep100
363,style yeah I think this entire place,ep100
366,gives me anxiety just the size I think,ep100
369,overall it's just too small for me it's,ep100
372,gonna be very tight and I think we're,ep100
375,gonna be all over each other and this is,ep100
378,the bad room much my a bad room it's a,ep100
381,nice precise room yeah,ep100
384,wow this is incredible things is a,ep100
387,beautiful courtyard we can let the dog,ep100
390,out very easily here the kids can play,ep100
393,out here I think my number one priority,ep100
396,is having enough space it doesn't have,ep100
399,to be as big as the house we had but I,ep100
402,want to make sure we're comfortable it's,ep100
405,really rare to find in the central area,ep100
408,something like this private yeah it adds,ep100
411,a lot of living space it's what we're,ep100
414,looking for in outdoor space so I'm,ep100
417,gonna be there all the time you need a,ep100
420,little bit of space to stretch out,ep100
423,change rooms go to a different place let,ep100
426,me show you the inner courtyard wow this,ep100
429,is really nice I think it's got really,ep100
432,nice sized bedrooms the kitchen is a,ep100
435,little small well not a little small the,ep100
438,kitchen is very small so that does,ep100
441,concern me the price is amazing overall,ep100
444,I think the space is great yeah I mean,ep100
447,there's positives and negatives of it I,ep100
450,mean you've got this this beautiful,ep100
453,courtyard the space I know it's nice but,ep100
456,it's very it feels very small to me,ep100
459,overall me having three girls in the,ep100
462,house I need some space for myself at,ep100
465,times,ep100
468,- er goes off the deep end for Jane five,ep100
471,bedrooms and you have a pool wow that's,ep100
474,big that's what I'm looking for elevator,ep100
477,that means the house is too big it was,ep100
480,just too much space day this is not,ep100
483,downsizing at all,ep100
486,we're gonna actually learn how to fight,ep100
489,like gladiators a job opportunity for,ep100
492,Cortney Moke has her family leaving,ep100
495,their perfect American life to broaden,ep100
498,their horizons moment you are fighters,ep100
501,this has been a dream of mine for,ep100
504,probably ten years to actually live in,ep100
507,another country so this means that from,ep100
510,this moment you will be my slaves,ep100
513,what and the opportunity finally came up,ep100
516,Nick and I was able to convince Dave to,ep100
519,go along with me so hey we're moving but,ep100
522,Dave's not used to moving and you'll,ep100
525,have to give up his job his friends and,ep100
528,his favorite pastime this fight is for,ep100
531,the power in the family okay once the,ep100
534,the application process began it,ep100
537,definitely got a little nerve-racking,ep100
540,part that you know this is going to be a,ep100
543,reality it's definitely a little bit,ep100
546,more of a challenge for me personally,ep100
549,come on Bobby,ep100
552,it's a shoot this was my idea so really,ep100
555,at the end of the day I feel all the,ep100
558,pressure that I've got to figure out a,ep100
561,way to make it work,ep100
564,I've made a commitment to work we've,ep100
567,sold our house we're prepared to sell,ep100
570,the rest of our belongings maybe you,ep100
573,deserve lies it's critical that we find,ep100
576,a home that we're all gonna be,ep100
579,comfortable in,ep100
582,Courtney thinks they could all be,ep100
585,comfortable in a small city apartment we,ep100
588,can let the dog out very easily here the,ep100
591,kids can play out here you will be Roman,ep100
594,citizens and this means that you have to,ep100
597,pay taxes Dave is on board for moving to,ep100
600,Rome but not necessarily into a much,ep100
603,smaller space it's gonna be very tight,ep100
606,and I think we're gonna be all over each,ep100
609,other if Dave wants space Chiara has,ep100
612,just the place in the suburbs okay I'm,ep100
615,looking it's really rare to find in Rome,ep100
618,house with a giant space so that's the,ep100
621,reason why I had to bring them out of,ep100
624,like the central area that is way bigger,ep100
627,than I was really wanting to have and,ep100
630,you have a fool Wow I love that that,ep100
633,might be something to consider,ep100
636,we had a pool back at our house in,ep100
639,"Philly it's all-inclusive and it's 3,000",ep100
642,and hate hundred dollars probably the,ep100
645,area is done exactly what I was,ep100
648,envisioning it doesn't feel very,ep100
651,European to me,ep100
654,feels like we could be you know anywhere,ep100
657,in the United States yeah I'm excited to,ep100
660,see the size,ep100
663,so guys welcome oh wow this is the space,ep100
666,that I was looking this is a lot more,ep100
669,modern than I was expecting based on the,ep100
672,look of the outside well you've got that,ep100
675,nice kind of American style kitchen I,ep100
678,guess you oh yeah yeah gasps like we,ep100
681,talked about look at it I think saying,ep100
684,oh the kitchen is actually really nice I,ep100
687,mean the oven is actually a good size a,ep100
690,nice sized fridge for which is something,ep100
693,where you needle yeah what's familiar to,ep100
696,the home in Philadelphia that we had is,ep100
699,just the openness of that main room when,ep100
702,you walk in its what we had what we're,ep100
705,used to and I love just the the over,ep100
708,looking from the kitchen into the room,ep100
711,it's great for just I want to watch over,ep100
714,the kids and then while we're preparing,ep100
717,food absolutely,ep100
720,is that a working fireplace yes it is if,ep100
723,you follow me I will show you something,ep100
726,which is really nice the elevator that,ep100
729,means the house is too big I think it's,ep100
732,gonna be like a fool not to do stairs,ep100
735,every time and I will show you the,ep100
738,bedrooms okay take a look there's no,ep100
741,European feel really whatsoever visa,ep100
744,stop us 4-bedroom wow this is quite big,ep100
747,yeah that's good space and you have a,ep100
750,balcony here oh that's nice,ep100
753,and it also overlooks the pool which is,ep100
756,great and these is the basement Wow too,ep100
759,much space they of like this is the,ep100
762,playroom but I really wanted to downsize,ep100
765,I mean this is not downsizing at all,ep100
768,yeah this is very very nice in the kids,ep100
771,absolutely loved swimming I mean for me,ep100
774,it's just so big the location doesn't,ep100
777,even feel like we're in Europe here I,ep100
780,think it may be a tougher transition,ep100
783,than you think downsizing that much so,ep100
786,we have a lot of positives here and this,ep100
789,I understand having some similarities,ep100
792,between here and Philly is important but,ep100
795,at the same time I really wanted a,ep100
798,change,ep100
801,it's really difficult to find something,ep100
804,that can really match both of their,ep100
807,needs which are so different difficult,ep100
810,but perhaps not impossible I love it I,ep100
813,mean this is definitely what I was in,ep100
816,it's a four bedrooms of full equipped,ep100
819,kitchen and with a large living area,ep100
822,there's also a beautiful terrace with a,ep100
825,view on the roman forum ruins,ep100
828,[Music],ep100
831,it's like a pizza in a cone I'm not sure,ep100
834,but we're gonna find out,ep100
837,Courtney mode has high hopes for her,ep100
840,move to Rome,ep100
843,this move is really important for not,ep100
846,only my career but also for my family,ep100
849,Bettina is branch outside the soft,ep100
852,inside and then we start for the typical,ep100
855,recipes from Rome our grandma's original,ep100
858,my dream is that we all gain a new and,ep100
861,open perspective about the world around,ep100
864,us what do you think you would like addy,ep100
867,meatballs and really grow an,ep100
870,appreciation for people who come from,ep100
873,all different parts of the world all,ep100
876,that's definitely worth trying Kourtney,ep100
879,thinks living in a small city apartment,ep100
882,is worth trying she understands that,ep100
885,we're doing this for her initially I've,ep100
888,always been in a stable job so Dave is,ep100
891,looking to make this transition as easy,ep100
894,as possible for the family one of the,ep100
897,big things with the move is we want to,ep100
900,be able to minimize some of our stress,ep100
903,and have more fun that's interesting,ep100
906,and I think if we don't find the place,ep100
909,that is comfortable for us we don't want,ep100
912,to be adding a layer of stress that,ep100
915,we're just not looking to have right now,ep100
918,you want to try to be fun no thank you,ep100
921,that means house 2 is much more what,ep100
924,Dave had in mind this is the space that,ep100
927,I was but this would be an up size for,ep100
930,them when Courtney wants to downsize,ep100
933,it's just too much space Dave I mean,ep100
936,this is not downsizing at all Kiara,ep100
939,thinks a rare find in the heart of Rome,ep100
942,could be what they're both looking for,ep100
945,city life and space I think that these,ep100
948,apartment matches all their requests it,ep100
951,should be perfect for them so are we in,ep100
954,the historical center of the city oh yes,ep100
957,yes,ep100
960,so we are just behind the Roman Forum I,ep100
963,love it I mean this is definitely what I,ep100
966,was envisioned so guys this is the,ep100
969,apartment it's a penthouse it's a four,ep100
972,bedrooms two bathrooms a full equipped,ep100
975,kitchen and with a large living area,ep100
978,there's also a beautiful terrace with a,ep100
981,view on the roman forum ruins got ivy,ep100
984,growing on the other side of the street,ep100
987,so it's very European feel to me we're,ep100
990,in the center of Rome tell me what the,ep100
993,prices are to 600 for EM well okay so,ep100
996,that is quite a bit over our budget but,ep100
999,it sounds like it covers so much of what,ep100
1002,I was looking for and the location is,ep100
1005,just incredible now I feel like I'm,ep100
1008,really challenged to the side what's,ep100
1011,most important for me this is the,ep100
1014,hallway it's a little tight in here this,ep100
1017,is the living room,ep100
1020,excellent I love the chandelier,ep100
1023,the built-ins the floor it's beautiful I,ep100
1026,really like it very white so this is a,ep100
1029,full kitchen with four gas stove tops,ep100
1032,there's plenty of counter space prep,ep100
1035,space kids can eat breakfast here a,ep100
1038,little nook yeah that's really a true so,ep100
1041,guys this is the first bedroom I love it,ep100
1044,it is high ceiling the molding the,ep100
1047,archway it'll be tight to fit our bed in,ep100
1050,here though we'll see I think this,ep100
1053,apartment gives us a really great,ep100
1056,compromise,ep100
1059,it gives Dave the space that he was,ep100
1062,looking for but it's still smaller than,ep100
1065,what we had in the United States so I,ep100
1068,feel like I am downsizing a little yet,ep100
1071,it's in this amazing location you can,ep100
1074,really see that you're in the center of,ep100
1077,Rome through these big windows it's,ep100
1080,great so what about these stairs what is,ep100
1083,this the terrace,ep100
1086,Wow this is incredible,ep100
1089,you're the forum it's it's just unreal,ep100
1092,this is really incredible I could,ep100
1095,absolutely come out to this every day I,ep100
1098,think it would be an incredible addition,ep100
1101,to the space inside a little oasis in,ep100
1104,the heart of room as an apartment I can,ep100
1107,consider something like this but I don't,ep100
1110,know if I can get over that budget I,ep100
1113,think it's actually worth splurging on,ep100
1116,the budget which I'm surprised to hear,ep100
1119,myself say that just when agreement,ep100
1122,seems to be in reach it still proves,ep100
1125,elusive it has the exact feel from,ep100
1128,living in Europe that I was looking for,ep100
1131,so you know the penthouse is also a way,ep100
1134,over our budget old-world streets that,ep100
1137,we're actually moving here,ep100
1140,Courtenay may still be in awe but now,ep100
1143,it's a reality we've really got to make,ep100
1146,a decision on where we're gonna live,ep100
1149,after 10 years of dreaming about it the,ep100
1152,Stars finally aligned to where she could,ep100
1155,convince her husband to move their whole,ep100
1158,family abroad this was my idea so really,ep100
1161,at the end of the day I feel all the,ep100
1164,pressure all the load but they have yet,ep100
1167,to align on which house to live in the,ep100
1170,home is the foundation so we want a,ep100
1173,place that were ultimately all happy,ep100
1176,living it,ep100
1179,house one perfectly fit Courtney's,ep100
1182,desire to downsize it had a great,ep100
1185,outdoor space we can let the dog out,ep100
1188,here the kid can play out here and was,ep100
1191,way under budget three thousand and five,ep100
1194,hundred dollars the price is great Dave,ep100
1197,liked it but thought the smaller space,ep100
1200,left no room for privacy it's nice but,ep100
1203,it's very small to be overall could you,ep100
1206,imagine cooking Thanksgiving dinner in,ep100
1209,here no I could house to put them back,ep100
1212,in the suburbs in an up sized house that,ep100
1215,made Dave feel much more comfortable,ep100
1218,this is the space that I was looking I,ep100
1221,love to see the over looking from the,ep100
1224,kitchen into the room but the immense,ep100
1227,space made Kourtney's head spin that,ep100
1230,means the house is too big Wow too much,ep100
1233,space Dave this is you know it's,ep100
1236,downsizing it at all,ep100
1239,house 3 offered good space in the heart,ep100
1242,of Rome this is incredible but the price,ep100
1245,forty six hundred for it well okay so,ep100
1248,that is quite a bit over our budget,ep100
1251,[Music],ep100
1254,the first one now I just don't think,ep100
1257,that I want to live in is the,ep100
1260,ground-floor apartment yeah it was small,ep100
1263,and we're all gonna be on top of each,ep100
1266,other I just don't know if that,ep100
1269,apartments gonna give us what we need,ep100
1272,I'm in agreement with you so you know,ep100
1275,with the townhouse I love the pool I,ep100
1278,didn't expect that we'd be able to get,ep100
1281,one it's gonna give me something to do,ep100
1284,in the summer with the kids plus we have,ep100
1287,all that space so for me with the,ep100
1290,townhouse it's not an allocation I had,ep100
1293,envisioned at all when we thought about,ep100
1296,moving to Europe,ep100
1299,there's no Piazza it really doesn't have,ep100
1302,that European feel plus it's so big I,ep100
1305,really wanted to downsize it definitely,ep100
1308,makes me feel more comfortable okay the,ep100
1311,penthouse it has the exact feel for,ep100
1314,living in Europe that I was looking for,ep100
1317,the room sizes were all really good the,ep100
1320,kitchen was actually plenty big so you,ep100
1323,know the penthouse is also way over our,ep100
1326,budget yeah you're right about that so,ep100
1329,I'm just really torn I know you really,ep100
1332,want that penthouse you know it really,ep100
1335,just has the best of both worlds I feel,ep100
1338,like for our family,ep100
1341,but I know how reluctant you were about,ep100
1344,this whole move and I saw how,ep100
1347,comfortable you are in that townhouse so,ep100
1350,I feel like you know I'm okay to let you,ep100
1353,get what you want with where we live Wow,ep100
1356,I did not expect you to come around like,ep100
1359,that I just I know I saw your face we're,ep100
1362,at the the penthouse and I just I,ep100
1365,figured that was gonna be what you,ep100
1368,wanted so thank you this is one of my,ep100
1371,favorite things to do in Rome ruins of,ep100
1374,the ancient civilization and this is a,ep100
1377,church from the medieval times this was,ep100
1380,a quite a change for us and I think I've,ep100
1383,adjusted pretty well see how that used,ep100
1386,to be a dome,ep100
1389,yes I'm happy that we made the move just,ep100
1392,because the experiences that we've had,ep100
1395,so far every weekend we really try to,ep100
1398,plan something to do that we wouldn't,ep100
1401,get to take advantage of if we were,ep100
1404,still living in the United States,ep100
1407,all right who's gonna get first yeah D,ep100
1410,okay ultimately decided that we're gonna,ep100
1413,give Isabel the master bedroom so the,ep100
1416,girls can be on the same floor all right,ep100
1419,we've taken the smaller bedroom on the,ep100
1422,third floor which has the bathroom so,ep100
1425,it's kind of been a like a little sweet,ep100
1428,for us and it's worked out well in Rome,ep100
1431,everyday we're experiencing something,ep100
1434,new some of its great and some of its a,ep100
1437,little bit of a challenge but all of it,ep100
1440,is opening our minds to new experiences,ep100
1443,in new cultures that's exactly what I,ep100
1446,wanted for my kid,ep100
12,wow this is so open and so big it was,ep101
15,just fantastic young parents Shawn and,ep101
18,Ashley are on the hunt for a new home in,ep101
21,Seattle,ep101
24,[Music],ep101
27,he's a mr. Fixit who wants a place in,ep101
30,the city that he can renovate there's a,ep101

117,more soft spoken and China's the,ep101
120,outgoing can talk to any one time a guy,ep101
123,and I think we complement each other,ep101
126,really well what a rainy Seattle date,ep101
129,yeah like get all these cute store so,ep101
132,come on let's go,ep101
135,the animal is just an amazing city it's,ep101
138,probably the prettiest city I've ever,ep101
141,seen in my life it's almost like a,ep101
144,picture but they're 1200 square foot,ep101
147,starter home has been a bit of a handful,ep101
150,so we bought this house for years ago it,ep101
153,needed a lot of work keep on doing one,ep101
156,lower remodel and okay let's do this and,ep101
159,my plans get bigger and we have to redo,ep101
162,everything we've had two different sets,ep101
165,of staircases for a while we had just a,ep101
168,giant hole in the middle of our floor,ep101
171,those maybe hit people over basically,ep101
174,had to jump over the hole yeah I can't,ep101
177,do more project so with a max budget of,ep101
180,"750,000 dollars they're on the hunt for",ep101
183,a new home we've outgrown this house,ep101
186,it's just too small for us with our,ep101
189,daughter she takes over all the space,ep101
192,all the open space that we have as all,ep101
195,the toys and there's not a place for her,ep101
198,to run around we don't really have a,ep101
201,yard we have a really small front yard,ep101
204,and she loves being outside and we can't,ep101
207,just let her be outside the kids,ep101
210,bedrooms that ones upstairs ones,ep101
213,downstairs,ep101
216,our bedrooms downstairs so I'd like to,ep101
219,have the kids bedrooms and our bedrooms,ep101
222,on the same level how about this one,ep101
225,this one's nice I like this one I would,ep101
228,like a move-in-ready home so maybe,ep101
231,something that's newer I've been working,ep101
234,on this house for years I love doing it,ep101
237,so I much rather have a house it needs a,ep101
240,little work this is the type of,ep101
243,neighborhood you just walk everywhere,ep101
246,coffee shops gonna be right in the,ep101
249,corner and get out of your hair and it,ep101
252,nice to be close to parks nerd thing I'm,ep101
255,a big city guy I love the walkability of,ep101
258,everything so one of my favorite things,ep101
261,to do is without the kids and just walk,ep101
264,to a coffee shop go grab a cup of coffee,ep101
267,so that's that's a huge thing I mean of,ep101
270,course that si is frustrated and wants,ep101
273,to go out we can get a little bit more,ep101
276,from money I will give her that you know,ep101
279,we could probably get move-in-ready less,ep101
282,work everything that I do not want this,ep101
285,is totally my style I like this one I,ep101
288,mean so my style is definitely more of a,ep101
291,new build,ep101
294,I like the northwest contemporary I like,ep101
297,just the straight lines the open the,ep101
300,bright character I don't mind that each,ep101
303,of them kind of looks like each other on,ep101
306,the street I like the uniform look,ep101
309,there's no character to this house,ep101
312,that's my spectrum say cookie cutters,ep101
315,myself would be your typical Northwest,ep101
318,class and so basically with the,ep101
321,characters the big pillars the white,ep101
324,trim I will bungalow type it's got a lot,ep101
327,of wood going on a lot,ep101
330,dark woods that's character Ashley and,ep101
333,will be so much happier than commuting,ep101
336,for an hour hour and a half to basically,ep101
339,you know have a suburban house it looks,ep101
342,the same all right so here's the house,ep101
345,it's listed at $6.99 yeah that's not bad,ep101
348,today their broker Tara has lined up a,ep101
351,place a little more suited to Shaun a,ep101
354,bungalow near downtown Ballard Ballard,ep101
357,is a great neighborhood,ep101
360,it is very walkable with coffee shops,ep101
363,restaurants parks we can get in to a,ep101
366,neighborhood like this at a decent price,ep101
369,point it would just be amazing,ep101
372,looks a little tiny from the house it so,ep101
375,"it's 1,700 square feet total",ep101
378,"however 1,100 square feet finished",ep101
381,oh three bedrooms one bath one bath it,ep101
384,got one back but I really want you guys,ep101
387,to look through the whole house keep an,ep101
390,open mind because it has an unfinished,ep101
393,basement which has a basement it's got a,ep101
396,lot of potential this is like the exact,ep101
399,style Craftsman bungalow in a great,ep101
402,neighborhood all right come on in oh so,ep101
405,here we have living room hardwood floors,ep101
408,opens to the dining room kitchen I,ep101
411,really like this step for dining space,ep101
414,that's not something we have in our,ep101
417,current home phony both of this toys,ep101
420,separate play space so we have a kitchen,ep101
423,over here yes about this if you take,ep101
426,this wall out right here no no no no,ep101
429,knocking down walls no I did not want,ep101
432,this open or just be such a nice flow,ep101
435,into the dining room and this whole,ep101
438,kitchen was a project John is very,ep101
441,excited about a project I mean he just,ep101
444,lit up when he got the idea to knock,ep101
447,down this kitchen,ep101
450,Aisling on the other hand is the voice,ep101
453,of reason and the voice of no which i,ep101
456,think is a great balance for them i,ep101
459,think he needs her and she needs him,ep101
462,they're gonna have to find a happy,ep101
465,medium with whatever place it is that,ep101
468,they choose but let me show you guys the,ep101
471,first bedroom okay would this be one of,ep101
474,the kids bedroom this time yeah it's,ep101
477,nice a little bit as well I think I'd be,ep101
480,good kids room too,ep101
483,well let's go to the second bedroom,ep101
486,upstairs so both the kids rooms will be,ep101
489,up here where's our bedroom so there is,ep101
492,remember a third bedroom downstairs so,ep101
495,we're gonna go look at yeah that's,ep101
498,something we kind of wanted to avoid no,ep101
501,we wanted to come all the bedrooms,ep101
504,upstairs on one level together,ep101
507,downstairs there's not a bathroom,ep101
510,downstairs the main bathroom is here,ep101
513,upstairs would you guys come on in I do,ep101
516,like the color of the tile I mean it's a,ep101
519,nice blue I mean okay that's I don't say,ep101
522,I love it it's not bad it is tight in,ep101
525,here though and as the only bathroom I,ep101
528,mean yeah all four of us sharing this,ep101
531,bathroom is gonna be interesting,ep101
534,they head downstairs to the unfinished,ep101
537,basement so you'll notice that this is,ep101
540,mid construction but the previous owner,ep101
543,actually started so you have new drywall,ep101
546,I'd really like to show you what could,ep101
549,potentially be your master bedroom okay,ep101
552,in the basement in the basement but keep,ep101
555,in mind that this is under construction,ep101
558,meaning that it's actually a finished,ep101
561,space but there's a lot of there's,ep101
564,things that need to come out,ep101
567,Wow you are kidding but it seems like,ep101
570,there's a lot to do in this room we're,ep101
573,looking at more costs more projects I,ep101
576,also don't like that this is downstairs,ep101
579,and the kids would be upstairs these we,ep101
582,got the kids on the same floor space we,ep101
585,can maybe the bathroom and down here or,ep101
588,something like that try to make it a,ep101
591,little bit more livable okay it's,ep101
594,manageable I think we can do something,ep101
597,as I complete capped off all right well,ep101
600,I'd like to take you guys outside,ep101
603,okay the garage and then also the,ep101
606,backyard,ep101
609,alright so from the garage here's your,ep101
612,backyard this is nice,ep101
615,I think if we put up a new fence and,ep101
618,then closer it'd be great for the kids,ep101
621,so yeah it'll be great little swing set,ep101
624,over there nice deck over here it's uh,ep101
627,it's great love it a lot of potential so,ep101
630,this house is exactly what I'm looking,ep101
633,for,ep101
636,the character is a craftsman cottage,ep101
639,bungalow but your finished basement do,ep101
642,the kitchen and I'd really love to get,ep101
645,my hands dirty,ep101
648,yeah don't spray anything but I mean,ep101
651,there's a lot of things about this house,ep101
654,that we didn't lunch I mean we don't own,ep101
657,the house of that room in the basement,ep101
660,and we're gonna end up with the bedroom,ep101
663,in the basement and I mean how much do,ep101
666,you think it would cost to finish off,ep101
669,the basement you know I think about 30,ep101
672,"$40,000 I just I don't know if it's",ep101
675,worth it,ep101
678,I'm in a great house just playing today,ep101
681,I have a lot of concerns much fun and,ep101
684,all the projects he wants to do this,ep101
687,house we knocking down walls updating,ep101
690,kitchens and bathrooms and a basement,ep101
693,project and I just don't want to be in a,ep101
696,house where we're doing projects for,ep101
699,another four or five years so now their,ep101
702,brokers lined up a totally move-in ready,ep101
705,house for Ashley Wow pretty naughty,ep101
708,actually that's pretty nice,ep101
711,[Music],ep101
714,after the birth of their second baby,ep101
717,Sean and his wife Ashley have outgrown,ep101
720,their home in Seattle and are looking,ep101
723,for a larger space so far they've seen a,ep101

741,bungalow Sean style but it's totally,ep101
744,move-in ready for Ashley so we're here,ep101
747,in Magnolia which is a neighborhood just,ep101
750,north of downtown Magnolia to me is,ep101
753,probably a good compromise between what,ep101
756,ashley is looking for what I am looking,ep101
759,for it's so close to the city it really,ep101
762,has that quiet suburban feel that,ep101
765,Ashley's looking for we're gonna look at,ep101
768,a home three bedrooms two baths a little,ep101
771,"over 1,600 square feet it's listed for",ep101
774,735 okay what do you guys think about,ep101
777,the style well it's a bungalow bungalows,ep101
780,are definitely not my style and it's,ep101
783,very plain and it needs some landscaping,ep101
786,yeah yeah I mean it could use a little,ep101
789,character we can we can add something to,ep101
792,it oh wow this is pretty nice actually,ep101
795,that's pretty nice it's completely,ep101
798,redone yeah you have engineered,ep101
801,hardwoods throughout the main um it's an,ep101
804,open living kitchen though this kitchen,ep101
807,you've got quartz countertops,ep101
810,stainless-steel appliances what I really,ep101
813,don't like about the kitchen isn't I,ep101
816,mean you can touch both sides at the,ep101
819,same time I mean it is really narrow,ep101
822,right I mean look at this I mean we're,ep101
825,gonna have the dishwasher open,ep101
828,uh-huh and look at this we're gonna get,ep101
831,stuck right there and you know this is,ep101
834,gonna be and with two kids running,ep101
837,around,ep101
840,yeah a little dangerous but it is I mean,ep101
843,it's a nice kitchen I do like that it's,ep101
846,been completely updated I mean it's nice,ep101
849,that there won't be any products they,ep101
852,check out the two bedrooms and a,ep101
855,bathroom on this level the dining room,ep101
858,then head out,ep101

876,downstairs to the basement where there's,ep101
879,a bonus room as well as the master suite,ep101
882,this is a really tight space I mean,ep101
885,there's nowhere to move brush my teeth,ep101
888,no we're just yeah lots of elbow in here,ep101
891,yeah now we came in for a double of,ep101
894,ambien here is that door even close Wow,ep101
897,alright let's go check out the master,ep101

906,there's a window I mean that lets in,ep101
909,light and it's a I mean it's a decent,ep101
912,size wrong it's not tiny I was really,ep101
915,hoping not to have a master in the,ep101
918,basement it's kind of trick to got to,ep101
921,the kids bedrooms at night with house,ep101
924,getting up like four times a night right,ep101
927,now to feed the kids it's definitely a,ep101
930,consideration oh yeah okay it's a,ep101
933,bungalow which I really like and it's in,ep101
936,a city neighborhood yeah I like that it,ep101
939,has been updated units move-in ready,ep101
942,which is great for me I don't really,ep101
945,feel like we're gaining that much out of,ep101
948,the house I mean the layout is very,ep101
951,similar to what we have right now it's,ep101
954,not that much bigger than our current,ep101
957,home so now their brokers showing them a,ep101
960,home it's much bigger it's four bedrooms,ep101
963,"three baths and over 3,000 square feet",ep101

1002,with a ton of work which ashley doesn't,ep101
1005,want then they saw a completely redone,ep101
1008,bungalow but they felt it was a little,ep101
1011,too tight so now their brokers lined up,ep101
1014,a bigger home in Bothell a suburb about,ep101
1017,20 miles from Seattle all right so we're,ep101
1020,a little bit outside your comfort zone,ep101
1023,as far as location however this is a new,ep101
1026,construction it's four bedrooms three,ep101
1029,"baths and over 3,000 square feet it's",ep101
1032,right under your budget,ep101
1035,750 perfect wouldn't even know what to,ep101
1038,"do at 4,000 square feet I really like",ep101
1041,the northwest contemporary style and I,ep101
1044,mean the fact that it's got four beds,ep101
1047,and three baths that's perfect this is,ep101
1050,definitely my style of home I love the,ep101
1053,Northwest contemporary I love that it's,ep101
1056,"a new bill I love that it's over 3,000",ep101
1059,square feet this is definitely my kind,ep101
1062,of house we also have a nice outdoor,ep101
1065,deck with territorial views that's,ep101
1068,fairly nice that's really nice actually,ep101
1071,oh wow I really like the fireplace and I,ep101
1074,like how nice and open and bright the,ep101
1077,spaces they check out a bedroom being,ep101
1080,used as an office and a bathroom on this,ep101
1083,floor then they move on to the great,ep101
1086,room Wow,ep101
1089,wow this is so open and so big there's,ep101
1092,so much space here I love this it is,ep101
1095,pretty nice actually having a space for,ep101
1098,the kids over here we can be cooking at,ep101
1101,the dining room right there this is just,ep101
1104,fantastic so you have a nice big green,ep101
1107,space this is definitely a nice-sized,ep101
1110,yard I mean we could definitely get,ep101
1113,maybe a dog and have a swing set out,ep101
1116,here it's nice all right well let's go,ep101
1119,check out the upstairs,ep101
1122,okay got three bedrooms and two full,ep101
1125,baths great three bedrooms on the same,ep101
1128,floor,ep101

1134,out a flex space at the top of the,ep101
1137,stairs and two spacious bedrooms for the,ep101
1140,kids then move on to the master my king,ep101
1143,bed this is the size of a living room,ep101
1146,those mountains over there are,ep101
1149,breathtaking yeah I could definitely,ep101
1152,wake up to this view every morning it's,ep101

1158,master bedroom yeah well here's the,ep101

1170,down there and you know I made long,ep101
1173,showers yeah twice as long great oh yeah,ep101
1176,I was surprised at how much Shaun,ep101
1179,actually likes a lot of the aspects of,ep101
1182,the home the hardest cell on this is,ep101
1185,probably gonna be the commute followed,ep101
1188,secondly by the lack of walkability I,ep101
1191,really like the house I mean I love the,ep101
1194,style the northwest contemporary look I,ep101
1197,love that there's the three bedrooms all,ep101
1200,in the one level with two kids we need,ep101
1203,it it's really good now the commute it,ep101
1206,can be really concerning I mean it is it,ep101
1209,is out here,ep101
1212,yeah but what I really like about this,ep101
1215,house is there are no projects we just,ep101
1218,don't have to worry about anything I'm,ep101
1221,surprised how much I actually do love,ep101
1224,this house it's just can we look at the,ep101
1227,community and all the driving now having,ep101
1230,seen several homes Shaun and Ashley will,ep101
1233,have to decide what's most important,ep101
1236,space location or projects so ready to,ep101
1239,make a decision I think so it is gonna,ep101
1242,be tough,ep101
1245,[Music],ep101
1248,Shawn and Ashley have been on the hunt,ep101
1251,for a bigger home for their family in,ep101
1254,Seattle they've seen several options now,ep101
1257,it's decision time so what do you think,ep101
1260,about classman bungalow in Ballard at 69,ep101
1263,it's a great location there's some flaws,ep101
1266,to that house though because I mean it,ep101
1269,doesn't mean quite a bit of work,ep101
1272,especially in the basement that it's not,ep101
1275,finished it's a work in progress we're,ep101
1278,looking at having a master bedroom in,ep101
1281,the basement again I don't know how I,ep101
1284,feel about some of these things if the,ep101
1287,neighborhood I mean that's exactly what,ep101
1290,I'm looking for,ep101
1293,it's quiet it's really so so the city I,ep101
1296,don't know if I want to get involved in,ep101
1299,a house that needs more projects what do,ep101
1302,you think that remonda bungalow and,ep101
1305,Magnolia for 7:30 Bible I really liked,ep101
1308,it I mean it was nice and open I liked,ep101
1311,the yard the living room was a little,ep101
1314,small so I don't think we're we're gonna,ep101
1317,get that space that we've been looking,ep101
1320,for so what do you think about that new,ep101
1323,building Bothell first 750 that was,ep101
1326,surprised how much I liked that house,ep101
1329,this space for a family is amazing no,ep101
1332,it's gorgeous it's beautiful yeah I mean,ep101
1335,I don't have too many bad things to say,ep101
1338,except the drive and it's a big negative,ep101
1341,that's a negative for me is but that,ep101
1344,house is freakin amazing so which one,ep101
1347,will they choose,ep101
1350,[Music],ep101
1353,which one do you think that you would,ep101
1356,want to put an offer in the house that,ep101
1359,needs work and projects in Ballard just,ep101
1362,being in that neighborhood with all,ep101
1365,those activities you know the,ep101
1368,walkability is something really hard to,ep101
1371,pass up I mean I can see our family,ep101
1374,living in the house growing in the house,ep101
1377,and you know that being our forever home,ep101
1380,even with all the projects so have we,ep101
1383,made a decision I think we may have yeah,ep101
1386,yeah okay well let's call Tara and make,ep101
1389,an offer okay what couldn't offer in two,ep101
1392,months ago and lien closed on the house,ep101
1395,about a month ago but we were able to,ep101
1398,get the house at a reasonable price 708,ep101
1401,are the agreement with Ashley was she,ep101
1404,maybe get a contractor so we actually,ep101
1407,have work going on in the basement right,ep101
1410,now and we haven't moved into the house,ep101
1413,quite yet we're preparing to do so in,ep101
1416,the next couple days,ep101
1419,looks like they've made a lot of,ep101
1422,progress so far yeah I mean they get in,ep101
1425,there the layout of this house limbs,ep101
1428,well to having a master in the basement,ep101
1431,I don't even think it's gonna feel like,ep101
1434,a basement and the big thing we really,ep101
1437,wanted to do was put a bathroom in down,ep101
1440,there this is the big ad right here yes,ep101
1443,this is what you really wanted a big,ep101
1446,nice bathroom so they're in the process,ep101
1449,of doing that right now should hopefully,ep101
1452,be finished in the next couple weeks and,ep101
1455,it looks so much better without all the,ep101
1458,debris,ep101
1461,it's really opened up quite a bit,ep101
1464,without all that and now you can see the,ep101
1467,windows almost finished I find to be,ep101
1470,really nice yeah well it definitely,ep101
1473,won't be dark in here with that extra,ep101
1476,window and we're looking for to it I,ep101
1479,like that both the kids are at least on,ep101
1482,the same level and they're right up the,ep101
1485,stairs from us so it's not like we're,ep101
1488,tracking across the house every time we,ep101
1491,have to go up the stairs they're right,ep101
1494,there which is nice getting you cabinets,ep101
1497,in here it's just gonna be amazing as,ep101
1500,for the kitchen I don't know how long I,ep101
1503,can actually last that kitchen that wall,ep101
1506,between the kitchen and the dining room,ep101
1509,it's coming down I really can't wait,ep101
1512,until we can get the kids back here and,ep101
1515,you know they'll have a great time they,ep101
1518,can have so much fun in the backyard I,ep101
1521,just have a huge relief to finally,ep101
1524,actually get a house and in a preferred,ep101
1527,neighborhood is just unreal I really,ep101
1530,understand how much fun I wanted to be,ep101
1533,in a neighborhood like this because in,ep101
1536,the lower and he just would have been,ep101
1539,unhappy which would have made me unhappy,ep101
1542,too,ep101
1545,this is the house that we're gonna have,ep101
1548,our kids grew up and it just represents,ep101
1551,us being a family she you can see her,ep101
1554,light up when she saw this house so I,ep101
1557,think this is you know secretly,ep101
1560,this is your favorite house,ep101
1563,[Music],ep101
12,[Music],ep102
15,look at all this stuff guys when you,ep102
18,shouldn'ta Celia got married they,ep102
21,promised each other that one day they'd,ep102
24,live in Taiwan we want to explore their,ep102
27,cultural ties into the country but with,ep102
30,three kids in tow keeping that promise,ep102
33,will be difficult it'll be a different,ep102
36,experience for us yes I want what I want,ep102
39,I love it I can picture it already but,ep102
42,it's way over our budget,ep102
45,[Music],ep102
48,20 for another trip downtown he met at a,ep102
51,summer camp 17 years ago we got married,ep102
54,11 years ago 12 years ago now time flies,ep102
57,and now we have three kids and they are,ep102
60,nine six and four you guys had a good,ep102
63,time in the city both of my parents were,ep102
66,born in Taiwan and you she was born in,ep102
69,Taiwan we've always talked about moving,ep102
72,to Taiwan and so we're eager for kids to,ep102
75,experience the culture these are the,ep102
78,funds that grandpa really likes to eat,ep102
81,you guys wanna try one we hadn't,ep102
84,considered it for a while because of how,ep102
87,crazy and hectic life is with three kids,ep102
90,but I was an executive at a technology,ep102
93,company and my career was hitting a lull,ep102
96,and at the same time our oldest was,ep102
99,getting a little bit older and if we did,ep102
102,any later should be much more grounded,ep102
105,in our social circles and it'd be much,ep102
108,harder to leave and so it was Now or,ep102
111,Never,ep102
114,so they gathered their savings to pursue,ep102
117,a long time dream and a fresh start but,ep102
120,with the move game issues I am coming to,ep102
123,Taiwan with no job and it is definitely,ep102
126,anxiety inducing I'm a stay-at-home mom,ep102
129,so I'm anxious about how my kids are,ep102
132,going to adjust I'm concerned because,ep102
135,you should I don't see eye to eye on the,ep102
138,things that we want in an apartment,ep102
141,I am hoping for a creature comforts that,ep102
144,I could see my family enjoying whereas,ep102
147,he can live very basic as long as it,ep102
150,fits within our budget so this could be,ep102
153,quite a challenge,ep102
156,founded in the 1700s under China's Ching,ep102
159,dynasty Taipei became the capital of,ep102
162,Taiwan in 1894 featuring the famous,ep102
165,skyscraper Taipei 101 the city is home,ep102
168,to over 2.7 million people including,ep102
171,"over 9,000 expats many of whom were",ep102
174,drawn to the city's growing technology,ep102
177,industries a rental market in Taipei,ep102
180,stays high because right now the buying,ep102
183,price for the house is very high so even,ep102
186,the local people here we were to run the,ep102
189,apartment how kind of apartment are you,ep102
192,looking for we need something with at,ep102
195,least three bedrooms oh cool,ep102
198,I'd actually prefer an office as well,ep102
201,you plans to work from home I guess,ep102
204,that's probably his biggest wish item a,ep102
207,washer and dryer washer and dryer yes,ep102
210,and I heard a lot people from the states,ep102
213,prefer to have an oven but for Taiwanese,ep102
216,we don't really use albin is this also,ep102
219,very important to you but oven,ep102
222,definitely dishwasher would be nice,ep102
225,Cecilia wants something more modern and,ep102
228,more comfortable I'm willing to forego a,ep102
231,lot more of that we want to be close to,ep102
234,the schools at the same time we'd like,ep102
237,to also be close to public,ep102
240,transportation we also heard that the,ep102
243,northern part of Taipei is great for,ep102
246,families man no you have housing budget,ep102
249,hopefully we won't spend more than,ep102
252,"$2,400 a month it's a good budget but",ep102
255,that I really want is expert area the,ep102
258,rental market there is very high so as,ep102
261,they'll be a big change challenge or not,ep102
264,Carmen's starting them with an apartment,ep102
267,near their daughter's school it has just,ep102
270,one drawback,ep102
273,Lisa Palma and makes OCC us list has to,ep102
276,go over the budget,ep102
279,Wow this is awesome look at all these,ep102
282,cars being right in the middle of,ep102
285,everything,ep102
288,it came in to walk to the metro station,ep102
291,and I Scorsone a few blocks away oh here,ep102
294,we are this apartment beauty it's a,ep102
297,3-bedroom apartment with two bathroom,ep102
300,and how much is the rent,ep102
303,"it's 2,800 oh yeah I know it's slightly",ep102
306,over your budget that's a little more,ep102
309,than a little,ep102
312,our budget but we're happy to take a,ep102
315,look oh wow wow so spacious that's a lot,ep102
318,nicer than I was expecting me to I'm,ep102
321,pleasantly surprised gorgeous it is,ep102
324,there's definitely lots of natural light,ep102
327,in here yeah it's really nice,ep102
330,did you check out the TV that's all,ep102
333,included right yes all right and then,ep102
336,the furniture is nice too yeah it's,ep102
339,probably what I would pick any terms of,ep102
342,style yeah is that the balcony yes oh,ep102
345,wow is that Taipei 101 over there yes,ep102
348,that's Taipei 101 that's awesome I know,ep102
351,that's the serial love is this place the,ep102
354,furniture is very modern and looks super,ep102
357,nice but it's way over our budget which,ep102
360,is a concern especially since I don't,ep102
363,have a job yeah okay area okay,ep102
366,look at this table I love it it's nice,ep102
369,and open to the living room we can keep,ep102
372,an eye on the kids while we eat I love,ep102
375,that it's so open,ep102
378,yeah this is amazing and they have this,ep102
381,cool bar it'd be great for entertaining,ep102
384,or serving up breakfast for the kids,ep102
387,yeah and they have an endo full-size,ep102
390,oven yeah I love it it's beautiful and,ep102
393,spacious and bright I really like it you,ep102
396,should on the other hand he's looking at,ep102
399,a price but I really think for what this,ep102
402,apartment has to offer it might be worth,ep102
405,it let's check out the laundry space I,ep102
408,like it he's er nice and big Celia is,ep102
411,much more of a reactive and emotional,ep102
414,person when she sees a place she knows,ep102
417,she loves it instantly regardless of the,ep102
420,other issues that might exist me on the,ep102
423,other hand I like to really look at the,ep102
426,more practical aspects it's way over our,ep102
429,budget so I have to talk her down from,ep102
432,the ledge that's the bedroom for the,ep102
435,kids oh I like it's quite spacious yeah,ep102
438,check out the master bedroom,ep102
441,okay oh wow this is huge,ep102
444,oh I take that back I don't like it I,ep102
447,love,ep102
450,it look at this a walk-in closet no I,ep102
453,like it I really like it,ep102
456,Oh sisal is gorgeous it really is it has,ep102
459,the three bedrooms the two baths the,ep102
462,oven the washer the dryer it doesn't,ep102
465,have my office though it's also way over,ep102
468,our budget I feel a little bit bummed,ep102
471,that you should I don't share the same,ep102
474,opinion about this property I really,ep102
477,like it and I think that if we lived in,ep102
480,this apartment you would find that all,ep102
483,the comforts of the modern amenities,ep102
486,would be worth the cost,ep102
489,do you have something that might be a,ep102
492,little more on budget I'm concerned that,ep102
495,she loves this place so much especially,ep102
498,since this is the first property that,ep102
501,we've seen every property you see after,ep102
504,this she's gonna compare against this,ep102
507,one and it's gonna be hard to match up,ep102
510,considering that this one is overpriced,ep102
513,so it's gonna be tough sledding ahead of,ep102
516,us getting closer to their budget moves,ep102
519,them further from perfection look at,ep102
522,that,ep102
525,Cecelia cares a lot more about the,ep102
528,aesthetics and I can really live,ep102
531,anywhere,ep102
534,[Music],ep102
537,Oh have you guys had coil eggs before,ep102
540,Cecilia and you are fulfilling a,ep102
543,lifelong ambition and getting back to,ep102
546,his birthplace and her parents homeland,ep102
549,in Taiwan we've always talked about,ep102
552,moving to Taiwan you know that's,ep102
555,something that we always wanted to do,ep102
558,but there's something that we would do,ep102
561,in the future because of how crazy and,ep102
564,hectic life is with your kids really hot,ep102
567,so you guys need to be careful but my,ep102
570,career was hitting a lull and it wasn't,ep102
573,quite as interesting and at the same,ep102
576,time our two youngest ones or now six,ep102
579,and four so they were a little bit older,ep102
582,they can actually get something out of,ep102
585,the experience the timing was right so,ep102
588,they decided if you should needed to,ep102
591,find a new career they might as well be,ep102
594,looking in their dream city making that,ep102
597,kind of leap without anything determined,ep102
600,plans is a little scary but also makes,ep102
603,it exciting and opens up a whole world,ep102
606,of possibilities we're gonna try new,ep102
609,things I would like our children to see,ep102
612,this part of the world to explore,ep102
615,monuments and be a tourist in Taipei do,ep102
618,you guys like it,ep102
621,[Music],ep102
624,but with their life savings funding the,ep102
627,move they're quickly realizing that,ep102
630,although they share the same broad dream,ep102
633,the Devils in the details,ep102
636,moving all the way across the globe,ep102
639,without any friends or a network is,ep102
642,something that's already gonna be hard,ep102
645,so I am willing to spend a little bit,ep102
648,more on something I think might suit my,ep102
651,family whereas he is definitely thinking,ep102
654,about the budget the bottom line the,ep102
657,first house was the comfortable home,ep102
660,Cecilia pictured for their kids look at,ep102
663,this table I love it there's full-size,ep102
666,oven yeah I love it but you should worry,ep102
669,about sustainability she loves this,ep102
672,place but it doesn't have the office or,ep102
675,a fourth bedroom and it's way over our,ep102
678,budget up next Carmen's hoping an office,ep102
681,for use will inspire him to expand the,ep102
684,budget for this slightly cheaper,ep102
687,downtown option this era is the TMO era,ep102
690,tax payer era and it sparked me to come,ep102
693,food to the metro station and another,ep102
696,five minutes to total school this is the,ep102
699,beauty looks nice and it's a 3-bedroom,ep102
702,apartment plus one office for Yosh oh,ep102
705,and how much is this place,ep102
708,"it's $2,600 a month",ep102
711,a little more than we wanted to pay our,ep102
714,money at the moment is very limited and,ep102
717,so I'm really concerned about the budget,ep102
720,for this apartment she's coming oh it's,ep102
723,very spacious in here what is this area,ep102
726,my new karaoke and it's all comes with,ep102
729,furniture,ep102
732,okay separates just not quite my taste,ep102
735,so but okay and that's that I need a,ep102
738,rescue it's also not quite my style,ep102
741,there's a lot of textures on the wall a,ep102
744,little too much maybe for me a little,ep102
747,bit yeah okay okay let's go check the,ep102
750,kitchen,ep102
753,all right okay oh and they have the oven,ep102
756,you get your oven I know and big fridge,ep102
759,oh yes we definitely need the big fridge,ep102
762,with our three kids right I am a little,ep102
765,bit concerned what else might not be,ep102
768,working if we moved into here and if so,ep102
771,how long would it take to fix it but,ep102
774,unfortunately this kitchen doesn't cook,ep102
777,with the dishwasher maybe this is my new,ep102
780,dishwasher washing machine and dryer oh,ep102
783,it's a little bit smaller than what I'm,ep102
786,used to but at least there's a dryer you,ep102
789,get your dryer yeah you have to sunshine,ep102
792,so you can use for daga air dry we don't,ep102
795,really air dry much in the US but or,ep102
798,definitely willing to live like locals -,ep102
801,yeah okay yeah nice so let's check out,ep102
804,the office here oh nice bedroom oh okay,ep102
807,I like that they have ample storage here,ep102
810,yeah and there's another bedroom just,ep102
813,across the hall okay sounds good,ep102
816,and let's check out the master bedroom,ep102
819,wow this is nice mm-hmm the furniture,ep102
822,there's a little mismatched I'm not,ep102
825,loving that yeah but at least we have,ep102
828,the dressers and everything already,ep102
831,that's I mean it's a good thing my,ep102
834,biggest change is Yosh and Cecilia I,ep102
837,want different things but I think this,ep102
840,apartment is a very good compromise,ep102
843,that's our answer a password oh my gosh,ep102
846,look at they have one of those fancy,ep102
849,Japanese but washers it's very good for,ep102
852,winter mm-hmm,ep102
855,was really surprised at how you sh was,ep102
858,pumped up about the Japanese toilet it's,ep102
861,something he had never talked about,ep102
864,never brought up and he seemed so,ep102
867,excited about it what do you think about,ep102
870,at each place I like that it has,ep102
873,bedrooms that we were looking for the,ep102
876,fact that there is a washer/dryer and of,ep102
879,an elephant it's over our budget though,ep102
882,if you SH was in charge of the house,ep102
885,hunt the type of house we would end up,ep102
888,with would be bare-bones but it would be,ep102
891,for the right place I really don't want,ep102
894,"to go over 2,400 the fact that it's over",ep102
897,budget is a big concern of mine we moved,ep102
900,to Taiwan without having a job so,ep102
903,finances are a big issue do you have,ep102
906,anything that's a little bit cheaper,ep102
909,"it's $2,400 a month right on your budget",ep102
912,it's great to hear but meeting the,ep102
915,budget means even bigger sacrifices I,ep102
918,don't mind a more Spartan approach to,ep102
921,things it'll be a different experience,ep102
924,for us yes,ep102
927,[Music],ep102
930,[Applause],ep102
933,[Music],ep102
936,it's really different to some temple is,ep102
939,a place where Buddhist people pray and,ep102
942,they get thanks to their ancestors you,ep102
945,should need a career change so he,ep102
948,Cecilia and there are three kids are,ep102
951,fulfilling a lifelong dream by searching,ep102
954,for his new job in their familial,ep102
957,homeland of Taiwan both of my parents,ep102
960,grew up in Taiwan and you she was born,ep102
963,in Taiwan and we wanted to give the kids,ep102
966,a completely different experience being,ep102
969,immersed in the culture and just,ep102
972,experiencing life in Taiwan so he quit,ep102
975,his job they sold their stuff and made,ep102
978,the trek from California to Taipei,ep102
981,daddy's lighting the incense and part of,ep102
984,their immersion into Taiwanese culture,ep102
987,involves a visit to Taipei's famous,ep102
990,longshan temple you close your eyes and,ep102
993,you give thanks our ancestors it was,ep102
996,founded in 1738 and dedicated to the,ep102
999,buddhist goddess of mercy every day,ep102
1002,thousands visit for peaceful reflection,ep102
1005,and prayer do you guys want to go,ep102
1008,explore the temple some more with you,ep102
1011,shinto celia's priorities clashing,ep102
1014,perhaps prayers are just what their,ep102
1017,house hunt needs she's definitely the,ep102
1020,one who throws caution to the wind I'm,ep102
1023,analytical and rational I am coming to,ep102
1026,Taiwan with no job and I care a lot more,ep102
1029,about the price then this is Elia does I,ep102
1032,want what I want because I want to be,ep102
1035,comfortable and I want my children to,ep102
1038,also be comfortable so I am willing to,ep102
1041,spend a little bit more and hopefully,ep102
1044,it'll work itself out in the end four,ep102
1047,hundred dollars over budget the first,ep102
1050,downtown apartment at both sticking to,ep102
1053,their guns,ep102
1056,gorgeous I like it I take that back I,ep102
1059,don't like it I love it it doesn't have,ep102
1062,my fourth bedroom or an office though,ep102
1065,it's also way over our budget slightly,ep102
1068,closer to budget the second house got,ep102
1071,mixed reviews from Cecelia I am NOT a,ep102
1074,huge fan of the furnishings but this,ep102
1077,property hit most of the other items on,ep102
1080,my wish list but for you it was the same,ep102
1083,old story it's over our budget do you,ep102
1086,have anything that's a little bit,ep102
1089,cheaper next Carmen's taking them to a,ep102
1092,place that's in Usha's budget but that,ep102
1095,means some of Cecilia's wishes are left,ep102
1098,out this is 20 minutes on foot to the,ep102
1101,total school kind of farm and then 15,ep102
1104,minutes to metro station and that's the,ep102
1107,apartment here okay thanks it's a,ep102
1110,"four-bedroom apartment it's $2,400 of",ep102
1113,mainz right on your budget it's great to,ep102
1116,hear let's go take a look great,ep102
1119,humming toys oh wow surprisingly,ep102
1122,spacious plenty of room to do cartwheels,ep102
1125,I think the kids would really like it,ep102
1128,and then that a Chinese space way this,ep102
1131,is it for the kitchen yeah it's a bit,ep102
1134,small but hey at least you get an oven,ep102
1137,Wow Carmen what is this that's the,ep102
1140,dishwasher the kitchen is a bit tiny,ep102
1143,showed up if washer here but it's,ep102
1146,supposed to be on the balcony we put,ep102
1149,water on the one side and watch much,ep102
1152,you're gonna try it on the other side it,ep102
1155,doesn't have the washer/dryer though,ep102
1158,unfortunately no no this will be on your,ep102
1161,HR cost the washer and dryer outside yes,ep102
1164,well that's gonna be different too sissy,ep102
1167,is not that excited about this property,ep102
1170,because the kitchen is definitely on the,ep102
1173,small side and there's no washer and,ep102
1176,dryer in this place so either we have to,ep102
1179,learn how to wash our clothes by hand or,ep102
1182,we have to buy a washer and dryer too,ep102
1185,right okay this is the master bedroom,ep102
1188,yeah it's kind of smaller than what I,ep102
1191,thought but hey look have these nice,ep102
1194,built-ins that's a plus lots of storage,ep102
1197,space I like that and there's a master,ep102
1200,bathroom here look it has one of those,ep102
1203,funky horizontal shower things Wow,ep102
1206,I'm not sure if we'll actually use,ep102
1209,something like that I know but might be,ep102
1212,really fun hey can we see the other,ep102
1215,bedrooms yes sure this way this size,ep102
1218,yeah it's definitely big enough for the,ep102
1221,two kids and then some more storage yeah,ep102
1224,nice for the clothes I like how it's all,ep102
1227,organized and there are also another two,ep102
1230,small bedrooms the other bedrooms are,ep102
1233,perfectly fine too and then the fourth,ep102
1236,bedroom we can use as an option yeah,ep102
1239,that's the swimming pool Wow,ep102
1242,oh it's pretty awesome I can definitely,ep102
1245,see our kids using this a lot yeah our,ep102
1248,kids are like specially love water the,ep102
1251,location is pretty good I really like,ep102
1254,the four bedrooms too I don't mind a,ep102
1257,more Spartan approach to things I don't,ep102
1260,need all the amenities but Cecelia is,ep102
1263,definitely looking for more of the,ep102
1266,creature comforts it does not have a,ep102
1269,dishwasher that's properly in the,ep102
1272,kitchen,ep102
1275,there's no washer/dryer it's farther,ep102
1278,from public transportation,ep102
1281,the school's overall I don't think life,ep102
1284,would be very comfortable if we pick,ep102
1287,this place and that's kind of the,ep102
1290,downfall of this place its cost versus,ep102
1293,comfort as you shin Cecilia pick their,ep102
1296,home I mean it's gorgeous but that place,ep102
1299,seems to make less and less sense the,ep102
1302,more we talk about it,ep102
1305,[Music],ep102
1308,it's so peaceful here it's a nice slice,ep102
1311,of nature in a big city like Taipei I,ep102
1314,know you shin Cecilia are all in moving,ep102
1317,their family from California to their,ep102
1320,ancestral homeland in Taiwan we're not,ep102
1323,there any fish in there oh yeah their,ep102
1326,top concerns are for their children I,ep102
1329,think I want you guys to take a bath,ep102
1332,before you do anything else I want my,ep102
1335,children to be comfortable so I am,ep102
1338,willing to spend a little bit more I am,ep102
1341,coming to Taiwan with no job and I care,ep102
1344,a lot more about the price then Cecilia,ep102
1347,does so what do you think of the city,ep102
1350,apartment it had everything that I,ep102
1353,wanted it have the oven the washer the,ep102
1356,dryer it even had a walk-in closet this,ep102
1359,place is gorgeous it doesn't have an,ep102
1362,office though it's also way over our,ep102
1365,budget well what did you think about the,ep102
1368,apartment with the office that one was,ep102
1371,still over budget but a little closer,ep102
1374,and the location was great too there's,ep102
1377,only five minutes the public,ep102
1380,transportation and schools but,ep102
1383,unfortunately this case it doesn't equip,ep102
1386,with the dishwasher it's just not quite,ep102
1389,my taste that apartment have a,ep102
1392,hodgepodge of different kinds of,ep102
1395,furniture but it's leather and it's,ep102
1398,gonna be much easier to clean the city,ep102
1401,apartment what about the apartment with,ep102
1404,the swimming pool I can definitely see,ep102
1407,our kids using this all the time I like,ep102
1410,the fact that it had a fourth bedroom,ep102
1413,for my office it's also right on budget,ep102
1416,all right but does it also have a washer,ep102
1419,and dryer too I'll butcher you know this,ep102
1422,is it for the kitchen and worry about,ep102
1425,cooking in there plus it's kind of far,ep102
1428,from,ep102
1431,forgot about that part 20 minutes away,ep102
1434,that's a long hike every single day so,ep102
1437,is it safe to say that we could cross,ep102
1440,out the swimming pool apartment I think,ep102
1443,that's right,ep102
1446,I can't imagine walking 20 minutes every,ep102
1449,day each way to drop the kids off and,ep102
1452,get real real soon we're down to the,ep102
1455,city apartment and the office apartment,ep102
1458,kind of love the city apartment it's so,ep102
1461,spacious there's so much light that,ep102
1464,comes in the view it I mean it's,ep102
1467,gorgeous,ep102
1470,yeah but how often are you actually,ep102
1473,gonna use the view if we pick the office,ep102
1476,apartment I'm gonna use the office,ep102
1479,pretty much every single day but you,ep102
1482,know what we would probably use every,ep102
1485,single day the dishwasher and that large,ep102
1488,laundry room but it's so expensive and I,ep102
1491,don't have a job right now so I think,ep102
1494,that's gonna be tough the office,ep102
1497,apartment it offers the best of both,ep102
1500,worlds it checks off a lot of our,ep102
1503,wishlist items it's close by to the,ep102
1506,schools a price that's closer to our,ep102
1509,budget well I guess it might make more,ep102
1512,sense even if I do have to give up my,ep102
1515,dishwasher so you're okay with office,ep102
1518,apartment I think so I mean I think it's,ep102
1521,the one that's gonna make the most sense,ep102
1524,for our family and I get my butt washer,ep102
1527,so I guess you get that can you move the,ep102
1530,couch back I love it,ep102
1533,my favorite thing about living in Taipei,ep102
1536,is having a fresh perspective on life,ep102
1539,it's refreshing it's nice to have a,ep102
1542,change of pace I'm working from home I,ep102
1545,have a freelance consulting gig can I,ep102
1548,help you it's my home way sure of course,ep102
1551,the income is a little less stable but,ep102
1554,it's nice to be able to take as much,ep102
1557,time off as I want how about some mango,ep102
1560,shave ice yeah the children are,ep102
1563,adjusting well they seem pretty happy it,ep102
1566,doesn't he did,ep102
1569,I feel more connected to my children I,ep102
1572,feel more connected to the things that,ep102
1575,we do our community are you guys happy,ep102
1578,that we moved to Taiwan,ep102
1581,[Music],ep102
12,let's say you did good I love the view,ep103
15,yeah Molly and Chris are looking to,ep103
18,purchase their first condo in the heart,ep103
21,of Chicago I really can't get any more,ep103
24,Chicago yeah I think I think he likes it,ep103
27,Chris wants a modern place with,ep103
30,floor-to-ceiling windows but Molly is,ep103
33,pushing for a more rustic look I love,ep103
36,how we don't have to worry about picking,ep103
39,a paint color like what the brick that's,ep103
42,done I preferred be all windows so we,ep103
45,don't have any pain whatsoever,ep103
48,these windows are pretty big Chris I,ep103
51,mean come on who will sacrifice on style,ep103
54,for their spouse I love it the windows,ep103
57,are awesome you can see the whole city,ep103
60,yeah this whole city can see us too you,ep103
63,really want like all that just like,ep103
66,exposed,ep103
69,[Music],ep103
72,oh I'm Chris and I'm an attorney I'm,ep103
75,Molly and I am a project coordinator for,ep103
78,a professional association Chris and I,ep103
81,have met in law school during,ep103
84,orientation Chris decided to finish law,ep103
87,school I dropped out thumbs up we've,ep103
90,been together for about ten years and,ep103
93,married for a little over two we came,ep103
96,here in one of our first days anything,ep103
99,oh my gosh we come to this place all the,ep103
102,time currently we are renting in a,ep103
105,high-rise in downtown Chicago we love it,ep103
108,there's world-class restaurants shopping,ep103
111,everything you want it's right here it's,ep103
114,just a cleaner prettier in New York City,ep103
117,good old Chicago but rather than renting,ep103
120,again they've decided the time has come,ep103
123,to actually buy a place thanks to a,ep103
126,little nudging from their families I,ep103
129,feel like we got peer pressured into it,ep103
132,honestly we're the only people in our,ep103
135,immediate families who don't own my,ep103
138,brothers both owned their own homes and,ep103
141,Chris's little sister just bought her,ep103
144,first place when I maybe check out some,ep103
147,furniture since we have a lot more space,ep103
150,absolutely it'll give us some ideas yeah,ep103
153,what we're currently living now it's a,ep103
156,one-bedroom we've been renting it for,ep103
159,the last five years and after we've got,ep103
162,married we just need a little bit more,ep103
165,space they want to upgrade to at least a,ep103
168,two-bedroom condo preferably one with an,ep103
171,additional office or den but they're,ep103
174,worlds apart on style,ep103
177,I love the classic industrial loft style,ep103
180,exposed brick timber ceiling to me it's,ep103
183,like a homey feel okay like this all the,ep103
186,old knots on there I grew up in a ranch,ep103
189,home very rural neighborhood we had this,ep103
192,giant fireplace and the brickwork which,ep103
195,is such a great beautiful focal point,ep103
198,it's something I've had grow to,ep103
201,appreciate as an adults you probably,ep103
204,like something that's more like clear,ep103
207,and sleek great yeah if it was made,ep103
210,clear like Molly I also grew up you know,ep103
213,kind of surrounded by the trees and,ep103
216,everything else but make it short and,ep103
219,sweet I want to live in a modern condo,ep103
222,floor-to-ceiling windows I want to look,ep103
225,out and see the city it feels very,ep103
228,cosmopolitan and different than how I,ep103
231,grew up but I love it building like,ep103
234,that's really where I want to be they're,ep103
237,just so great boring this neighborhood,ep103
240,it's got everything I want for the,ep103
243,laughs so a character in the history the,ep103
246,South Loop is really kind of the ideal,ep103
249,location it's close to downtown we both,ep103
252,work downtown we're open to other areas,ep103
255,5 10 20 minute commute is perfect,ep103
258,anything longer than that you know we,ep103
261,might as well move out to this I'm,ep103
264,looking for two full baths definitely a,ep103
267,washer and dryer in the unit and I,ep103
270,really would love to have a bright white,ep103
273,kitchen,ep103
276,I would love some sort of outdoor space,ep103
279,a balcony a terrace a roof deck have a,ep103
282,car in the city which is expensive and,ep103
285,paying for parking is an,ep103
288,added monthly expense I'd like to avoid,ep103
291,neither Molly or I really wants to get,ep103
294,into any major renovations the most I'd,ep103
297,be really comfortable spending would be,ep103
300,"somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,000",ep103
303,I'm actually okay with going up to 425,ep103
306,if we find a perfect place where we,ep103
309,really don't have to do anything to it I,ep103
312,think you know we want to be in this,ep103
315,place a long time I think we should,ep103
318,spend the money I practiced consumer,ep103
321,bankruptcy,ep103
324,uh-hum some very hesitant to spend too,ep103
327,much on house don't want to end up using,ep103
330,my own services to start their real,ep103
333,estate agent shows them an option in,ep103
336,their current neighborhood so today,ep103
339,we're in the South Loop we're seeing a,ep103
342,contemporary unit,ep103
345,"it's a 2-bed 2bath 1,300 square feet",ep103
348,"listed at 390,000 not bad does that",ep103
351,include parking it doesn't parking is,ep103
354,"listed as an additional 30,000 oh that",ep103
357,takes us right to the top of our budget,ep103
360,it does does have a tendency so it does,ep103
363,not have a den oh I don't know about,ep103
366,that well keep an open mind I definitely,ep103
369,think there's something here for both of,ep103
372,you,ep103
375,all right so come on in make yourself at,ep103
378,home okay your coats off oh wow look at,ep103
381,those windows let's say you did good I,ep103
384,love the view,ep103
387,yeah floor-to-ceiling windows you got,ep103
390,him,ep103
393,I like the hardwood floors I'm happy,ep103
396,about that I wish the ceilings were a,ep103
399,timber though I'm not so sure I like the,ep103
402,concrete it is a very contemporary style,ep103
405,I like it got a pantry it is oh yeah,ep103
408,there's tons of space doesn't look like,ep103
411,the dock you get into this one would you,ep103
414,call this a galley kitchen similar okay,ep103
417,a little more open than a galley the,ep103
420,appliances look nice and all but it's,ep103
423,closed off from the rest of the you know,ep103
426,I think we would end up driving each,ep103
429,other crazy,ep103
432,cuz you'd be on top of each other and I,ep103
435,really wanted a white kitchen and,ep103
438,clearly it's not let's go check out the,ep103
441,balcony oh wow this is great you can see,ep103
444,the river and the sky oh yeah this is a,ep103
447,good space you obviously see this empty,ep103
450,plot of land there is gonna be a,ep103
453,development down there okay that's,ep103
456,something to think about,ep103
459,yeah thanks to a construction site I,ep103
462,don't know about that back inside they,ep103
465,check out the guest bedroom hate the,ep103
468,carpet it looks nice now in a couple of,ep103
471,weeks with having a dog in here it's,ep103
474,gonna be a disaster zone,ep103
477,so deal-breaker I notice it is the only,ep103
480,extra space we have aside from the,ep103
483,master yes okay Kristen Molly's budget,ep103
486,is pretty realistic for first-time,ep103
489,homebuyers of Chicago two bedrooms in,ep103
492,that price range are definitely doable,ep103
495,but that third bedroom is something,ep103
498,we're gonna struggle to find so here you,ep103

546,you said there's this construction there,ep103
549,we don't know what its gonna look like,ep103
552,in the end it might be window to window,ep103
555,with some of our neighbors you really,ep103
558,want like all that just like it's,ep103
561,but looks like there's nice blinds too,ep103

591,split sinks that's amazing I don't have,ep103
594,to deal with like beard hairs on my face,ep103
597,I love the contemporary look at this,ep103
600,place,ep103
603,floor-to-ceiling windows the balcony the,ep103
606,bathroom is perfect and that's in the,ep103
609,south and well yeah I love the,ep103
612,neighborhood too both of us can walk to,ep103
615,work the only thing those I was really,ep103
618,looking for a third bedroom or that,ep103
621,enclosed end office space and the,ep103
624,carpeting has to go it is right at the,ep103
627,top of our budget,ep103
630,yeah and because the parking is not,ep103
633,included it really does take us at our,ep103
636,you know Jax wished it would have had,ep103
639,more like a timber laughs feeling,ep103
642,ideally I'd want something a little bit,ep103
645,more kind of cozy no older to find a,ep103
648,loft for Molly alyssa has to take them,ep103
651,out of their comfort zone this does not,ep103
654,look like the South Loop you're right,ep103
657,Alyssa,ep103
660,know about this,ep103
663,[Music],ep103
666,these are cool yeah looks like it's from,ep103
669,the deep sea the deep sea working with a,ep103
672,"$400,000 budget first-time homebuyers",ep103
675,Chris and Molly are looking for a condo,ep103
678,in downtown Chicago Chris liked a,ep103
681,two-bedroom contemporary with a balcony,ep103
684,in their prime location but it didn't,ep103
687,have the rustic elements or den / third,ep103
690,bedroom Molly's hoping for so today,ep103
693,their real-estate agent Alisa has an,ep103
696,option that she thinks will make up for,ep103
699,what the last home was missing this does,ep103
702,not look like the South Loop you're,ep103
705,right today we are in Pilsen we're going,ep103
708,to be seeing a 2-bed 2bath loft oh you,ep103
711,know we really wanted that third bedroom,ep103
714,you're in luck there is a done space and,ep103
717,it is large enough that it will,ep103
720,accommodate a third bedroom we're,ep103
723,looking at a total of 1577 square feet,ep103
726,listed at three hundred and sixty,ep103
729,thousand dollars it also includes a,ep103
732,parking space that's great,ep103
735,I mean it's definitely not my style it's,ep103
738,much more Molly's than my own you're,ep103
741,right it is a little bit of a mixture,ep103
744,though we have the historical features,ep103
747,of the loft and then it was also newly,ep103
750,rehabbed so we have more modern features,ep103
753,throughout the unit as well,ep103
756,[Music],ep103
759,oh wow look at these ceilings up here on,ep103
762,the right-hand side you're gonna have,ep103
765,the den this is a great space perfect,ep103
768,for an office over to your left here,ep103
771,you'd have one of the full bathrooms,ep103
774,it's small but you know it doesn't look,ep103
777,nice if you've done it looks fine and if,ep103
780,we make our way this way this is the,ep103
783,main living space Alyssa this is amazing,ep103
786,this is just what I was looking for,ep103
789,again with the timber ceilings the,ep103
792,exposed ductwork,ep103
795,oh and this brick is gorgeous oh wow,ep103
798,yeah and I love how we don't have to,ep103
801,worry about like picking it paint color,ep103
804,like with the bricks it's done I,ep103
807,preferred the old windows so we don't,ep103
810,have any pain whatsoever these windows,ep103
813,are pretty big Chris I mean come on does,ep103
816,this place have a balcony or no there's,ep103
819,no balcony but did you have a balcony,ep103
822,like Juliet yeah Romeo and Juliet so,ep103
825,just it kind of looks like a balcony but,ep103
828,you can't actually say it right actually,ep103
831,like an outdoor space right okay I see,ep103
834,that we're looking out on to a bunch of,ep103
837,train tracks right correct does that,ep103
840,mean we're close to the subway so,ep103
843,unfortunately there is no subway around,ep103
846,here but you are two blocks from a major,ep103
849,bus line that will take you downtown one,ep103
852,of the things I'm not so sure about is,ep103
855,moving out of the South Loop we've been,ep103
858,in our current neighborhood for almost a,ep103
861,decade so that would be an adjustment,ep103
864,what do you guys think of the kitchen,ep103
867,you know I love the layout of it I love,ep103
870,this nice big Center Island,ep103
873,but you know I have to say obviously,ep103
876,it's it's not a great wait kitchen you,ep103
879,know I know you can paint but I really,ep103
882,didn't want a project and there's no,ep103
885,backsplash either but is something you,ep103
888,could always install though yourself you,ep103
891,know you are significantly underneath,ep103
894,your budget yeah and no backsplash is,ep103
897,better than an ugly backsplash true,ep103
900,right around the corner they walk into,ep103
903,the master suite this is way bigger than,ep103
906,our current bedroom in fact we'd,ep103
909,probably have to buy some other,ep103
912,furniture in order to fill up this space,ep103
915,yeah I think so this bathroom is great,ep103
918,yeah it's got the double vanities,ep103
921,and it has a separate shower and tub,ep103
924,which is nice yeah on the other side of,ep103
927,the kitchen they find the laundry room,ep103
930,this one's actually pretty big yeah it,ep103
933,looks like we might have some room for,ep103
936,some storage in here too,ep103
939,and finally they see the guest bedroom,ep103
942,these closets are great we could use,ep103
945,these for our stuff too even when we,ep103
948,don't have guests here I like having,ep103
951,that well I love it it's got almost,ep103
954,everything I wanted with design it's,ep103
957,exactly what I was looking for and I,ep103
960,laughed I happen to like the fact that,ep103
963,it's a lot of square footage and it does,ep103
966,come with deeded parking included in the,ep103
969,price is not an additional twenty or,ep103
972,thirty thousand dollars or anything like,ep103
975,that I know we have that Juliet balcony,ep103
978,but it would have been awesome if we,ep103
981,could have some sort of usable outdoor,ep103
984,space I'm not entirely sure about Pilsen,ep103
987,it's not the South Loop it's not the,ep103
990,area that I really wanted to be in and,ep103
993,it wasn't the style I was looking for it,ep103
996,wasn't a modern irise it didn't have,ep103
999,focus and glass and because of that you,ep103
1002,know I'm unsure ELISA knows what Chris,ep103
1005,is looking for but isn't sure he can,ep103
1008,handle the truth about what it will cost,ep103
1011,this is getting expensive pretty fast I,ep103
1014,know,ep103
1017,[Music],ep103
1020,ah so pretty it certainly is hopefully,ep103
1023,we get a new place before it hit show,ep103
1026,Falls Molly and Chris are looking to buy,ep103
1029,their first condo in downtown Chicago,ep103
1032,"with in their $400,000 budget but they",ep103
1035,don't see eye to eye it is quite a,ep103
1038,challenge when you have a couple with,ep103
1041,two very different styles you really,ep103
1044,have to work hard to find something,ep103
1047,that's going to work for both of them so,ep103
1050,far they've seen a contemporary condo,ep103
1053,that was at the top of their budget but,ep103
1056,had the features Chris wanted then they,ep103
1059,saw a well-priced timber loft for Molly,ep103
1062,but it wasn't close enough to downtown,ep103
1065,and he didn't like the style so now,ep103
1068,they're on the north side of the city to,ep103
1071,see another option so this place looks,ep103
1074,like it was designed by Mies van der,ep103
1077,Rohe you are correct it is an iconic,ep103
1080,mid-century modern building about the,ep103
1083,1955 well that's exciting that's exactly,ep103
1086,what I was looking we're seeing a two,ep103
1089,back two bath condo the list price is,ep103
1092,three hundred and ninety nine thousand,ep103
1095,is not included it's an additional is,ep103
1098,two hundred and ten dollars a month,ep103
1101,saved a wrench parking you do this is,ep103
1104,getting expensive pretty fast,ep103
1107,I understand but you're both close to,ep103
1110,work okay the views are fantastic from,ep103
1113,the unit what floor are we going 28,ep103
1116,almost all the way to the top oh wow,ep103
1119,look at this he was amazing,ep103
1122,I know these buildings don't generally,ep103
1125,have a balcony space but for a view like,ep103
1128,this I don't mind we really can't get,ep103
1131,any more Chicago than this mm-hm I'm,ep103
1134,eeen I can see my office from here,ep103
1137,what's a I told you you can walk to work,ep103
1140,I see what you're talking about with the,ep103
1143,floor-to-ceiling windows that's that's,ep103
1146,right yeah well finally so Molly,ep103
1149,is your white kitchen yes it's white but,ep103
1152,it's on the dated side I was yeah is,ep103
1155,that a DVD player it is this seems more,ep103
1158,mid-90s modern the mid-century modern,ep103
1161,down the hall they check out the guest,ep103
1164,bedroom I mean it's small but our guest,ep103
1167,would have a fantastic view as well I'm,ep103
1170,glad I do not see carpet in here no,ep103
1173,carpet anywhere is there like an office,ep103
1176,or den space here there is no den space,ep103
1179,this is just a 2-bed 2bath but i do feel,ep103
1182,like this room is big enough where you,ep103
1185,could have an office space as well,ep103
1188,you know i think i'd be very tight,ep103
1191,ideally it'd be one or the other and,ep103
1194,especially with this weird you know,ep103
1197,heating unit we lose the ability to put,ep103
1200,something against the window,ep103
1203,unfortunately why don't we go take a,ep103
1206,look at the bathroom,ep103
1209,this is just the guest bathroom yes okay,ep103
1212,I like the design of it I just think,ep103
1215,it's a little on the small side the door,ep103
1218,bumps into the shower door be kind of,ep103
1221,awkward as a shower it's hard to see,ep103
1224,okay let's take a look at the master,ep103
1227,bedroom it's right here to your left,ep103
1230,oh wow this is perfect this is like one,ep103
1233,of the nicest views of the city I've,ep103
1236,seen it is a great view huh well yeah,ep103
1239,and it's a corner unit you didn't even,ep103
1242,tell them I didn't surprise it's a great,ep103
1245,size yeah I put the bed right here that,ep103
1248,way you get views out of that wall and,ep103
1251,wake up in the morning yeah I think I,ep103
1254,think he likes it,ep103
1257,so this is the master this is the master,ep103
1260,that we were in the,ep103
1263,it is smaller yeah where are you gonna,ep103
1266,put your towels you know where do I put,ep103
1269,my toothbrush well I mean we can work,ep103
1272,this out you know you can take this one,ep103
1275,I'll take the other one I love this,ep103
1278,place and all windows gonna get great,ep103
1281,light the size is good this is it,ep103
1284,couldn't be happier I think any,ep103
1287,Christmas rose-colored glasses,ep103
1290,you said the size was great I disagree I,ep103
1293,really wanted that you know separate,ep103
1296,office space oh you know I didn't see,ep103
1299,laundry where's the laundry but there is,ep103
1302,no washer/dryer in the unit but the,ep103
1305,building does have a laundry room I have,ep103
1308,not done that it's hard to think that,ep103
1311,I'm like paying all this money I thought,ep103
1314,the top of our price point and I'm still,ep103
1317,like digging for change get this place,ep103
1320,hold you the laundry I can do it for you,ep103
1323,I don't know if I really want you to now,ep103
1326,Molly and Chris must decide what matters,ep103
1329,most the parking the location for the,ep103
1332,windows color me shocked,ep103
1335,[Music],ep103
1338,I love driving into the city like this,ep103
1341,yeah I love driving through Molly and,ep103
1344,"Chris have $400,000 to spend on a new",ep103
1347,home after seeing a number of places,ep103
1350,it's time to decide so what do you think,ep103
1353,about the contemporary condo with the,ep103
1356,balcony for three hundred and ninety,ep103
1359,thousand dollars you know I love the,ep103
1362,location it's really close to where we,ep103
1365,live now,ep103
1368,the master bathroom was amazing it was,ep103
1371,fully upgraded it was like a spa in,ep103
1374,there the thing that I hated about that,ep103
1377,place is that there was carpet in both,ep103
1380,bedrooms and the kitchen layout seems so,ep103
1383,annoying yeah,ep103
1386,I love the windows in that place nice,ep103
1389,floor-to-ceiling it was the only place,ep103
1392,we looked at with a real balcony but it,ep103
1395,is next to a construction site and lord,ep103
1398,knows what that view is gonna be in a,ep103
1401,couple of years so what about the timber,ep103
1404,loft and pilsen for three hundred and,ep103
1407,sixty thousand dollars I loved it oh my,ep103
1410,gosh it had the exposed brick the,ep103
1413,exposed ductwork no carpet it was huge,ep103
1416,but it did not have outdoor space and it,ep103
1419,certainly didn't have your white kitchen,ep103
1422,you know you're right but it did have,ep103
1425,that enclosed den office space that I,ep103
1428,really wanted it was the only place we,ep103
1431,looked at with it,ep103
1434,it'd be a longer commute to work what,ep103
1437,we're dealing with now we're going to go,ep103
1440,outside more again so be mid-century,ep103
1443,"modern high-rise for 399,000",ep103
1446,I don't even need to ask what you,ep103
1449,thought of that one I know you loved it,ep103
1452,yeah I thought I had million-dollar,ep103
1455,views and did have your white kitchen it,ep103
1458,did but it needs a lot of upgrades and,ep103
1461,those bathrooms they were both so tiny,ep103
1464,there's no in unit washer and dryer well,ep103
1467,I don't know we've I've already told you,ep103
1470,I,ep103
1473,you know I just I'm in love with that,ep103
1476,timber loft color me shocked it's the,ep103
1479,style that I've always wanted it really,ep103
1482,has a warm homey feel to me I can't,ep103
1485,believe I'm saying this but I think that,ep103
1488,one will work best for the two of us are,ep103
1491,you serious I am I'm going to be missing,ep103
1494,the views in the floor-to-ceiling,ep103
1497,windows but the combination of the price,ep103
1500,and the size it was enough to make me,ep103
1503,think this gonna work the best for the,ep103
1506,both of us that's amazing I'm so excited,ep103
1509,should we call ELISA better do it fast,ep103
1512,before I change my mind you want to just,ep103
1515,start setting up the workspace yeah it's,ep103
1518,time to bring out the pig bring out the,ep103
1521,pig we moved in about two weeks ago and,ep103
1524,still unloading some boxes seen you in a,ep103
1527,"while this home was listed at $360,000",ep103
1530,and we ended up paying three hundred,ep103
1533,sixty two thousand five hundred but that,ep103
1536,did include a credit for closing cost,ep103
1539,if I knew honestly like it was the one I,ep103
1542,had that kind of butterfly feeling Hey,ep103
1545,yeah it looks nice I like it I think,ep103
1548,it's pretty obvious given this is a loft,ep103
1551,that I compromise the most but not only,ep103
1554,did we get more space for less money it,ep103
1557,does get great sunlight and thankfully,ep103
1560,there is a nice view of the Chicago,ep103
1563,skyline you know I'm just gonna have to,ep103
1566,get used to the brick you want to try,ep103
1569,some of these pastries I got yeah it's,ep103
1572,the new place that opened up right down,ep103
1575,the street when we tell people that we,ep103
1578,moved to Pilsen they get really excited,ep103
1581,cuz they're like oh that's such a great,ep103
1584,neighborhood oh yeah I think we're gonna,ep103
1587,be visiting this place a lot yeah the,ep103
1590,commutes a little bit longer but we're,ep103
1593,just a few blocks away from kind of the,ep103
1596,main drag of this neighborhood where,ep103
1599,there is all kinds of fun stuff that,ep103
1602,we're gonna love exploring yeah you like,ep103
1605,it here feel like home yet the thing I'm,ep103
1608,looking forward to the most is really,ep103
1611,just making this place feel like our own,ep103
1614,especially the open-concept kitchen,ep103
1617,living and dining space they've already,ep103
1620,gotten some estimates from some,ep103
1623,contractors to whitewash the cabinets,ep103
1626,and then we're gonna put up a white,ep103
1629,subway tile backsplash too so I'll be,ep103
1632,able to get the white kitchen,ep103
1635,we're good Chris and I are now part of,ep103
1638,the homeowner Club and our family my,ep103
1641,brother and his girlfriend came up to,ep103
1644,see the new place and check out the new,ep103
1647,neighborhood they had a great time so I,ep103
1650,think we'll probably have to buy a,ep103
1653,second bed soon,ep103
1656,[Applause],ep103
1659,[Laughter],ep103
12,this is why I brought you to this house,ep104
15,it's beautiful there really is dawn and,ep104
18,Jordan are searching rural Illinois for,ep104
21,a property with land for their dogs to,ep104
24,run two lakes they'd be swimming all day,ep104
27,they plan to cordon off rooms we have,ep104
30,the skate that I can EQ or so no open,ep104
33,floor plans look how open it is but to,ep104
36,get the land and layout they want they,ep104
39,may have to make some compromises on,ep104
42,style what do you think I didn't even,ep104
45,notice that until you just pointed it,ep104
48,out Thanks,ep104
51,[Music],ep104
54,he is the big dog and he's gonna eat it,ep104
57,tight it's like a horse my name is dawn,ep104
60,and this is my wonderful husband Jordan,ep104
63,we currently live in Collinsville,ep104
66,Illinois just outside of st. Louis how's,ep104
69,your orange sherbert super good hey I,ep104
72,made Reynard,ep104
75,I am a Public Programs educator and camp,ep104
78,manager at the say Louis Science Center,ep104
81,and I'm a project engineer Jordan I met,ep104
84,when we were in college and we had a,ep104
87,class together and we've been together,ep104
90,ever since,ep104
93,yep Council is a really great little,ep104
96,area because we are so close to st.,ep104
99,Louis to do the lot of those activities,ep104
102,being in a small town community is also,ep104
105,nice Townsville is known for their giant,ep104
108,ketchup bottle it's a old factory with a,ep104
111,big water tower that's a big ketchup,ep104
114,bottle we have two birds three cats and,ep104
117,we have two dogs that are ours we have a,ep104
120,small farm in our house and then we also,ep104
123,foster for a rescue so this is then he,ep104
126,needs a foster home he's deaf but you,ep104
129,can see really well oh he's so big yes,ep104
132,big with all their pets they've realized,ep104
135,it's time to sell their starter home and,ep104
138,buy a new place this time on a much,ep104
141,bigger spread farther out in the country,ep104
144,if we look for a house with space for,ep104
147,them to run we won't have to go on walks,ep104
150,all the time they'll be able to run and,ep104
153,wear themselves out of that way so we,ep104
156,won't have to exercise like we're,ep104
159,supposed to right I want as much,ep104
162,properties we can get the large open,ep104
165,area for the dogs he wants multiple,ep104
168,acres what about his house so it's not,ep104
171,quite as much Anchorage as I was hoping,ep104
174,for him you know something to get 10 20,ep104
177,and up acres we definitely still want,ep104
180,another room for the birds or places,ep104
183,they can be currently we have a big,ep104
186,sunroom lots of windows lots of light,ep104
189,so looking for a new place would,ep104
192,definitely be flexible to where they,ep104
195,have a nice place indoors but also it,ep104
198,will when the weather is nice to happen,ep104
201,of course I would really like a,ep104
204,Craftsman style type home so this house,ep104
207,I really like the look of there's,ep104
210,different definition there's different,ep104
213,depths in the house I'm not saying it's,ep104
216,terrible but I would prefer to go more,ep104
219,ranch farmhouse a lot of the farmhouse,ep104
222,to me is simplicity plain and simple I,ep104
225,would like to have the updated kitchen,ep104
228,and appliances definitely want at least,ep104
231,three bedrooms two bathrooms I think it,ep104
234,might be too much of an open floor plan,ep104
237,we talked about wanting to have that,ep104
240,separation for the dogs and this ever,ep104
243,habit with the large open floor plan,ep104
246,it's very difficult to kind of section,ep104
249,off the house when you're trying to,ep104
252,contain the dog so having a little bit,ep104
255,more defined rooms is gonna make that,ep104
258,process a little bit easier hardwood,ep104
261,floors in there they look really nice,ep104
264,yeah I like that there's no carpet that,ep104
267,means we could do a lot of cleaning and,ep104
270,keeping the birds by the windows as well,ep104
273,I like a big porch on any house,ep104
276,especially the farmhouse style I think,ep104
279,you know the wraparound or a partial,ep104
282,wraparound is a really neat feature whoa,ep104
285,there you go those are just my size curb,ep104
288,appeal is important to both of them and,ep104
291,they both like to avoid a major,ep104
294,renovation having just completed,ep104
297,renovating their current house it's kind,ep104
300,of miserable having to constantly live,ep104
303,through those renovations and yes the,ep104
306,end product was awesome but the road to,ep104
309,get there who is not awesome,ep104
312,still Jordan does like getting his hands,ep104
315,dirty making things one of the bigger,ep104
318,things I'd like to have is a dedicated,ep104
321,workshop I'm pretty sure that's for oil,ep104
324,filters they know they'll be taking on a,ep104
327,long commute by moving out to the,ep104
330,country especially for Jordan whose job,ep104
333,is farther they just hope to keep it at,ep104
336,an hour max our budget is 275 but,ep104
339,realistically we don't really want to go,ep104
342,that high at all going further away from,ep104
345,the city I think we'll get a lot more,ep104
348,bang for our buck first up is a house in,ep104
351,the rural community of Mount Olive,ep104
354,almost 50 miles from st. Louis it's,ep104
357,beautiful out here,ep104
360,that's for sure but this what's my,ep104
363,commute to be right around like 4550,ep104
366,minutes,ep104
369,what's yours gonna be then I probably,ep104
372,pushed in 90 minutes or so oh my,ep104
375,goodness I don't know if I could do that,ep104
378,that's someone that will have to have,ep104
381,only weight this is a hospital I like hi,ep104
384,Jen hey great what do you think about,ep104
387,the property walking up it's gorgeous,ep104
390,but this isn't really either of our,ep104
393,Styles not far grass a little bit more,ep104
396,of a mid-century type field I know and I,ep104
399,I brought you here because I think that,ep104
402,you're gonna like what the property,ep104
405,has to offer you have a workshop and,ep104
408,you've got acreage and lots of privacy,ep104
411,mmm that's pretty good,ep104
414,it's priced at two hundred thirty two,ep104
417,thousand dollars it's not just a,ep104
420,intriguing all right and I think you'll,ep104
423,see you're gonna need a little extra,ep104
426,room for some updates no gen remodels,ep104
429,but that's alright the property's gonna,ep104
432,be worth it,ep104
435,let's go inside alright you think what,ep104
438,do you think about the front porch,ep104
441,various writing this is great very cute,ep104
444,I like it,ep104
447,[Music],ep104
450,alright so it's pretty dated in here Don,ep104
453,I know you wanted an updated kitchen but,ep104
456,I want you to keep an open mind as we,ep104
459,take a look at this kitchen,ep104
462,oh yes very open-minded this is a,ep104
465,vintage dishwasher but it's offset by,ep104
468,your stainless steel refrigerators nice,ep104
471,it's bright looks fairly new yeah what,ep104
474,do you think about that ceiling I didn't,ep104
477,even notice that until you just pointed,ep104
480,it out thanks a lot papered ceiling,ep104
483,makes it a little more cozy for the,ep104
486,living space while it's dated I am,ep104
489,thinking that it is a nice setup for the,ep104
492,animals we have this gate that I can eat,ep104
495,you or the animals this is the family,ep104
498,room and look at this this is a nice,ep104
501,view I like being able look out see the,ep104
504,birds and everything so again is that,ep104
507,all of our property at all back there,ep104
510,that's part of the property to off the,ep104
513,dining room is the screened-in porch,ep104
516,this is great I don't see too many,ep104
519,neighbors hanging around here I think,ep104
522,this'll be perfect setup for the birds,ep104
525,and it extends out to another deck so,ep104
528,you have more space for entertaining or,ep104
531,just sitting outside and enjoying the,ep104
534,view they head downstairs to see the,ep104
537,finished basement this would typically,ep104
540,be a family room but I think for you,ep104
543,guys it would be a great place to put,ep104
546,the birds okay it's a possibility I mean,ep104
549,I don't know we could they burns down,ep104
552,here or upstairs what kind of just have,ep104
555,to see they look in on the two,ep104
558,downstairs bedrooms before heading,ep104
561,outside so this is why I brought you to,ep104
564,this house it's beautiful it really is,ep104
567,the nice thing about this piece of,ep104
570,property,ep104
573,seems like it's a pretty good mixture of,ep104
576,timber meadow and lon so at least,ep104
579,there's not a whole bunch of Mon to do,ep104
582,the dogs can run freely over there oh,ep104
585,yeah they run wild I think this house,ep104
588,would be very functional for our animals,ep104
591,the size of property that it comes with,ep104
594,with the 12 acres and the different land,ep104
597,styles that are on the acreage I think,ep104
600,it's great for our animals this is the,ep104
603,first time I've helped someone house,ep104
606,hunt so they have more space for more,ep104
609,animals here is the half bath right yeah,ep104
612,I definitely wanted the full bath but,ep104
615,it's fine it'll get the job done maybe,ep104
618,there's a chance to renovate do some,ep104
621,projects let's go check out the master,ep104
624,bedroom this is a really good-size room,ep104
627,that's a very good-sized room this is a,ep104
630,little bit of kind of an awkward,ep104
633,cubby area I'm sure we can make our,ep104
636,furniture fit if we end up going this,ep104
639,way but I just have to get a little,ep104
642,creative with it let's check out the,ep104
645,master back this is a great size it is,ep104
648,but it's missing one thing no second,ep104
651,sink I don't care about two sinks yeah,ep104
654,well that's because you always used my,ep104
657,sink before I never had a thing well,ep104
660,you've seen the whole house you've seen,ep104
663,the property what are your thoughts,ep104
666,obviously outside is perfectly inside,ep104
669,it's very pet friendly for our situation,ep104
672,with all the animals pet friendly and,ep104
675,lots of land but it's also definitely,ep104
678,dated in your commute I almost forgot,ep104
681,about the commute I definitely wouldn't,ep104
684,forgive that every more to it I'm,ep104
687,driving an hour and a half yeah since,ep104
690,this location makes Jordans commute,ep104
693,almost too far Jen shows the couple a,ep104
696,house much closer to st. Louis both sigh,ep104
699,Jen found us a ranch-style this time,ep104
702,yeah it's definitely not a craftsman,ep104
705,[Music],ep104
708,Jordan and John have 275 thousand,ep104
711,dollars for a property with a lot of,ep104
714,land for their pets in rural Illinois,ep104
717,they've seen a mid-century modern on 12,ep104
720,acres their ideal amount of space it had,ep104
723,a workshop and a closed floor plan but,ep104
726,it would need lots of work and at 90,ep104
729,minutes from Jordans job it may just be,ep104
732,too far out so now they're seeing a,ep104
735,place in Belleville that's more Jordan,ep104
738,style and with a shorter commute Oh si,ep104
741,Jin found us a ranch-style this time,ep104
744,yeah it's definitely not a craftsman,ep104
747,they're really open as soon as we got,ep104
750,some property to so that'll be good for,ep104
753,the dogs yeah absolutely got a ranch for,ep104
756,you,ep104
759,excellent only about a 30 to 45-minute,ep104
762,commute it for you Jordan all right,ep104
765,that's good yeah I think you're gonna,ep104
768,"like the price what do we got 230,000",ep104
771,opening that's gonna be a problem with,ep104
774,the dogs there's no easy way to section,ep104
777,off different spaces so that they can't,ep104
780,just run them up everywhere the floors,ep104
783,look really nice yeah great space for,ep104
786,the birds with all the windows oh yeah,ep104
789,absolutely being able to have options,ep104
792,really to put the birds just about,ep104
795,anywhere we choose tons of light in here,ep104
798,let's head this way take a look at the,ep104
801,kitchen it's not the kitchen the,ep104
804,refrigerators a little bit different,ep104
807,than the rest appliances so I update,ep104
810,that yes I also notice there's no,ep104
813,Hardware on Taniya anything that's off,ep104
816,of that I would recommend that when we,ep104
819,write an offer on the property we,ep104
822,actually write that in that the seller,ep104
825,is to provide you with an allowance for,ep104
828,hardware and have that installed they go,ep104
831,outside to check out the yard so how,ep104
834,much of this is ours this is a three,ep104
837,acre lot I know that that's not quite as,ep104
840,much as what you're wanting but again,ep104
843,this is what's gonna get you a little,ep104
846,bit closer into town you're missing a,ep104
849,little privacy but we can fix that with,ep104
852,trees good space for the dogs the art is,ep104
855,very open which is great for the dogs,ep104
858,run around but it would also mean we,ep104
861,would have to put an offense to contain,ep104
864,them,ep104
867,[Music],ep104
870,you know I do live having hard floors,ep104
873,for the dogs but the carpet seems to be,ep104
876,a good color that'll hide dirt so I,ep104
879,think it'll work a bathroom is down the,ep104
882,hall I mean it's a guest bath so I think,ep104
885,it's fine,ep104
888,dan looks nice updated yeah and here is,ep104
891,the master oh not very big is it yeah,ep104
894,this is disappointing not a fan of all,ep104
897,the trim or on the room and the ceilings,ep104
900,come on and and look at your master bath,ep104
903,[Music],ep104
906,it's livable because I really don't want,ep104
909,to live through a renovation again I,ep104
912,don't like the fillers I don't like the,ep104
915,tub I don't like the tile I don't,ep104
918,there's not a thing I like about the,ep104
921,master bath,ep104
924,I want to immediately take those pillars,ep104
927,down they head down to see the lower,ep104
930,level I think you're gonna find this is,ep104
933,your favorite part of the house you know,ep104
936,I don't like the thought of remodeling,ep104
939,and renovating but it's kind of nice to,ep104
942,have a clean blank slate to do whatever,ep104
945,you want with the big huge open basement,ep104
948,is great I think we can maybe put a,ep104
951,living space down there and I could have,ep104
954,a work area you could do a lock down,ep104
957,here this is huge,ep104
960,we've seen everything inside and out,ep104
963,what are your thoughts well it's not the,ep104
966,Craftsman style that I wanted it is the,ep104
969,range thought that I was looking for but,ep104
972,there's a lot of things in here that I'm,ep104
975,not really that thrilled about mainly,ep104
978,the master bath mm-hmm I know it's not,ep104
981,as much property as you wanted I did,ep104
984,like the hot floors throughout it's nice,ep104
987,to be able to move the bird cages around,ep104
990,when we need to the kitchen is updated,ep104
993,well enough I think we can deal with,ep104
996,that,ep104
999,I like that it's open it's very bright,ep104
1002,got plenty of room for the birds plenty,ep104
1005,of windows and a nice commute for you,ep104
1008,sounds pretty good still since they,ep104
1011,didn't get much land the last time,ep104
1014,they're trying to get a little farther,ep104
1017,out this view is gorgeous,ep104
1020,is great I love it out here it's very,ep104
1023,peaceful and serene,ep104
1026,[Music],ep104
1029,before I really kept one a snack a,ep104
1032,fragrance practicals and ratios dawn and,ep104
1035,Jordan are searching rural Illinois for,ep104
1038,a property with lots of land for their,ep104
1041,pooches working with a two hundred and,ep104
1044,seventy five thousand dollar budget,ep104
1047,they've seen a place on 12 acres but it,ep104
1050,was 90 minutes from Jordans job and it,ep104
1053,was very dated then they saw a much more,ep104
1056,updated place just 30 minutes to his job,ep104
1059,but it was on only three acres and the,ep104
1062,open floor plan would make fencing off,ep104
1065,rooms difficult so now their agent hopes,ep104
1068,this house just within their one hour,ep104
1071,max commute distance will work for,ep104
1074,location and lot size Jen this view is,ep104
1077,gorgeous yeah this is great,ep104
1080,the house is it really like a Craftsman,ep104
1083,style and it's not really a ranch either,ep104
1086,no but wait till you hear the details,ep104
1089,"it's almost 1,800 square feet on six",ep104
1092,"acres all for $250,000 I knew you'd like",ep104
1095,the setting we'll see what you think,ep104
1098,about the house it's really big - you,ep104
1101,know this might be a nice place for the,ep104
1104,birds to be able to survive the windows,ep104
1107,look at the view outside I mean this is,ep104
1110,great do you notice that up there oh,ep104
1113,it's pretty actually it's a very unique,ep104
1116,touch let's head on over this way this,ep104
1119,is your dining area and your kitchen,ep104
1122,this is an upgrade yeah they've,ep104
1125,definitely done some updating in the,ep104
1128,kitchen which is nice because I know,ep104
1131,that's something that's important for,ep104
1134,you yeah,ep104
1137,I mean in all the appliance match which,ep104
1140,is also a plus like they don't have to,ep104
1143,be stainless steel but matching is,ep104
1146,really nice so let me show you the bonus,ep104
1149,round okay so this is a bonus room slash,ep104
1152,laundry room would this be a good place,ep104
1155,for a workshop I think so it could also,ep104
1158,be a good place for the birds the birds,ep104
1161,could you know live in there and enjoy,ep104
1164,themselves however I could do the same,ep104
1167,thing in my own space and they could,ep104
1170,enjoy themselves in the living room down,ep104
1173,the hall is a full bathroom it's a nice,ep104
1176,size but it is a little awkward having a,ep104
1179,bathroom right off the kitchen I feel,ep104
1182,like this could make some some odd,ep104
1185,Thanksgiving dinner moment,ep104
1188,so head on into your master bedroom,ep104
1191,this is actually a burm house what that,ep104
1194,means is that the back side of the house,ep104
1197,is built in to the berm the berm is a,ep104
1200,hill and so the house is built into the,ep104
1203,hillside semi underground if you will so,ep104
1206,you don't have windows on the backside,ep104
1209,but having that door with a nice big,ep104
1212,window gives a lot of good light haven't,ep104
1215,the house built into the hill is unique,ep104
1218,but given our dog situation I'm fairly,ep104
1221,certain the dogs would be up on the roof,ep104
1224,and that could really cause some,ep104
1227,problems down the road let's go check,ep104
1230,out the master bath which what do you,ep104
1233,notice about that it's not attached,ep104
1236,right you notice there's no shower which,ep104
1239,would mean that you have company over,ep104
1242,and you if you need to shower you guys,ep104
1245,go through the kitchen that's weird,ep104
1248,yes this is your second bedroom they,ep104
1251,were smart adding that in because,ep104
1254,without that you couldn't put a window,ep104
1257,there because it is a burm home mm-hmm,ep104
1260,let's take a look upstairs at the third,ep104
1263,bedroom this is really pretty look at,ep104
1266,this view then nice little area for me,ep104
1269,with that pond it's too bad though,ep104
1272,there's no bathroom like right up here,ep104
1275,because this could almost be like a,ep104
1278,master suite very nice and easy access,ep104
1281,to a bathroom they head outside to the,ep104
1284,six acre yard this yard is beautiful the,ep104
1287,dogs would love it they wanted two legs,ep104
1290,they'd be swimming all day however have,ep104
1293,a little concern this is a lot of grass,ep104
1296,to mow,ep104
1299,what about the house what do you think,ep104
1302,about the house,ep104
1305,well the privacy is great it's got the,ep104
1308,nice updated kitchen that I wanted so I,ep104
1311,really like that it's got a little bit,ep104
1314,more of an open floor plan than I wanted,ep104
1317,because it's gonna be hard to section,ep104
1320,off the dogs in certain places you do,ep104
1323,have the room off the kitchen that would,ep104
1326,be great for the birds yeah that's true,ep104
1329,unless we put them in the living room,ep104
1332,and I could have my little workshop up,ep104
1335,there no that's more renovation that's,ep104
1338,what we don't want what I don't want,ep104
1341,that's so much easier than building a,ep104
1344,whole shop for me though well remember,ep104
1347,at this price you do have some room to,ep104
1350,do some renovations don't want to do the,ep104
1353,renovations Jen they've seen several,ep104
1356,options well their choice come down to,ep104
1359,the house in the woods with the long,ep104
1362,commute the ranch with the shorter,ep104
1365,commute but not enough land or the berm,ep104
1368,house with the open floor plan once you,ep104
1371,put that thing down and figure out what,ep104
1374,we're gonna do with this house situation,ep104
1377,okay,ep104
1380,dawn and Jordan have up to two hundred,ep104
1383,and seventy five thousand dollars to,ep104
1386,spend on a new home in Western Illinois,ep104
1389,they've seen several different houses,ep104
1392,but now it's time to decide on one so,ep104
1395,let's start with the house I had the,ep104
1398,woods with it for two hundred thirty two,ep104
1401,thousand man that house was beautiful,ep104
1404,when you pulled up to it inside it was,ep104
1407,closed off and after where you could,ep104
1410,section the dogs off if you need to set,ep104
1413,up four dogs that house was perfect the,ep104
1416,only real drawback I saw to it was all,ep104
1419,of that wallpaper and there's definitely,ep104
1422,some renovations that I see in the,ep104
1425,future I am very concerned like,ep104
1428,everything I think the workshop,ep104
1431,situation at the house with the woods,ep104
1434,was actually really really ideal you,ep104
1437,also have a long commute to work from,ep104
1440,there an hour and a half I think Jen,ep104
1443,said but I loved the property it was so,ep104
1446,private and so serene but what about the,ep104
1449,next house it's the ranch for two,ep104
1452,hundred and thirty thousand that one had,ep104
1455,a very serene beautiful setting had a,ep104
1458,little bit of acreage not as much as we,ep104
1461,still as we wanted the backyard wasn't,ep104
1464,real private you know we'd have to put,ep104
1467,up a fence and everything the kitchen is,ep104
1470,fairly updated the basements blank slate,ep104
1473,to do whatever we want the basement was,ep104
1476,awesome everything was really open on,ep104
1479,the inside of the house I'm not entirely,ep104
1482,sure how we would even try to close that,ep104
1485,off the ranch did have the best floor,ep104
1488,plan though for the birds one thing,ep104
1491,about the ranch is it was actually a,ep104
1494,pretty decent commute what about the,ep104
1497,"berm house for 250,000 plenty of room",ep104
1500,for the dogs to run but we would still,ep104
1503,have to build in a fenced-in area there,ep104
1506,because there was nothing to contain,ep104
1509,them they'd always be going into these,ep104
1512,ponds and lakes whatever out there what,ep104
1515,about the burn being built into the hill,ep104
1518,what do you think of that even though,ep104
1521,the back half was stuck in the side of a,ep104
1524,hill the front half was so bright it,ep104
1527,didn't feel like you were subterranean,ep104
1530,at all inside that master bath that,ep104
1533,wasn't connected on to the master,ep104
1536,bedroom meeting some updating there's a,ep104
1539,lot of things I think we would need to,ep104
1542,do to that house but it was quite a ways,ep104
1545,under budget to where we could you know,ep104
1548,maybe accomplish those things they had,ep104
1551,that one little bonus room but I know,ep104
1554,you wanted to put the birds there still,ep104
1557,a long commute from there I think my,ep104
1560,commute was for an hour somewhere around,ep104
1563,there so which one will they choose,ep104
1566,[Music],ep104
1569,so house that's in the woods has a great,ep104
1572,setup for the dogs I think the house is,ep104
1575,a little more conducive thar needs yeah,ep104
1578,plus it's got all the acreage yeah long,ep104
1581,commute from there but I love the,ep104
1584,property did we just make our decision I,ep104
1587,think that was it all right we made our,ep104
1590,decision here,ep104
1593,let's finish tighten this up real quick,ep104
1596,the asking price of this house is two,ep104
1599,hundred thirty two thousand dollars we,ep104
1602,were able to negotiate a few things few,ep104
1605,items with the house into that price and,ep104
1608,ended up paying that I ended up winning,ep104
1611,this house because of all the outdoor,ep104
1614,features that eight gives us and I got a,ep104
1617,workshop so I mean it was it was really,ep104
1620,a win-win on all fronts,ep104
1623,we have Zen we'll kinda have to work,ep104
1626,with them so he doesn't just like barrel,ep104
1629,through this dogs have adjusted the best,ep104
1632,of this place it's so nice that they can,ep104
1635,just go outside and run around and the,ep104
1638,twelve acres and we don't have to worry,ep104
1641,about them right now the birds are a,ep104
1644,little separated and just help them,ep104
1647,adjust a little easily so one doesn't,ep104
1650,bully the other one and to help them,ep104
1653,really settle in for a while we keep,ep104
1656,even the dogs away from the birds right,ep104
1659,now just so they can become adjusted we,ep104
1662,know there's going to be projects but at,ep104
1665,the current moment it is move-in ready,ep104
1668,no point do owner invite a room when all,ep104
1671,needs to go of all the houses we looked,ep104
1674,at this is by far the furthest drive we,ep104
1677,are well outside of the range that I was,ep104
1680,wanting but coming home to the house,ep104
1683,that we chose has been a real blessing,ep104
1686,and we're real happy with her,ep104
1689,you,ep104
12,[Music],ep105
15,this is just gorgeous been accepted a,ep105
18,job transfer you are only five minutes,ep105
21,from Mays like that just to make Rachel,ep105
24,happy,ep105
27,not too much charm it's not fair that,ep105
30,you get to have everything you want you,ep105
33,always do what you are but they have,ep105
36,different ideas I really want to get,ep105
39,back and tell you in culture for my,ep105
42,children on where they should live this,ep105
45,is definitely Italian living,ep105
48,I like Alec but way too far come warner,ep105
51,wide is there what I want that's like,ep105
54,any married couple isn't it yeah we need,ep105
57,to be realistic we hate being realistic,ep105
60,[Music],ep105
63,can you say uncle no purple Bravo I will,ep105
66,be leaving my job as a pediatric nurse,ep105
69,it's gonna be a big change for me but,ep105
72,it's been a dream of mine to live in,ep105
75,Europe and I'm head over heels to be,ep105
78,moving to Aviano Italy Ben's military,ep105
81,nursing job brought the whole family to,ep105
84,Italy but he doesn't share Rachel's,ep105
87,enthusiasm we were working together in,ep105
90,the DC area for the United States Air,ep105
93,Force and that's where originally met so,ep105
96,I was ready to just stay,ep105
99,you want to try strategy out there but,ep105
102,Rachel really pushed me to apply for,ep105
105,avianna and life is good when I let her,ep105
108,win you know my hair is this better than,ep105
111,ice cream back home I love the idea of,ep105
114,being able to take the kids to market,ep105
117,and having to really immerse themselves,ep105
120,in the culture 18-mile can you guys say,ep105
123,ciao,ep105
126,I'll be speaking fluent Italian and,ep105
129,people will be in awe because they will,ep105
132,have an accent,ep105
135,I want remember that one very very she'd,ep105
138,want to live where the Italians live and,ep105
141,I don't really want to be that far away,ep105
144,from work but she is stubborn and it,ep105
147,would be very difficult to get her to,ep105
150,change her mind,ep105
153,and we look at flakes mountains cute,ep105
156,Italian the village if I wasn't in love,ep105
159,with it really yet now I am beyond is in,ep105
162,the northeastern part of Italy,ep105
165,plus the mountains very close to the,ep105
168,Venetian beaches and Venice is only 45,ep105
171,minutes from here,ep105
174,it is a very small very Italian town but,ep105
177,it's become a mix of the Italian culture,ep105
180,with the American culture thanks to the,ep105
183,American base bringing the influx of,ep105
186,Americans to our area and we get a home,ep105
189,on this side way to far from work well,ep105
192,so what are the main things that we're,ep105
195,looking for we need three bedrooms ok,ep105
198,and maybe some room to garden ok,ep105
201,definitely needing to be within 20,ep105
204,minutes or so of the base baile de red,ep105
207,my bike tour could be nice I'm more,ep105
210,interested in having less American,ep105
213,neighbors and more Italian I just really,ep105
216,want to immerse in the culture and I,ep105
219,would like to find a house with Italian,ep105
222,charm and your budget $850 a month ok,ep105
225,I am totally willing to go above the,ep105
228,budget I just need to be close to work,ep105
231,but my wife says no because I'm not,ep105
234,gonna be working and I really want my,ep105
237,kids to experience I tell you in culture,ep105
240,and explore the local area so I want to,ep105
243,pinch every penny they want the American,ep105
246,dream in Italy but it's not gonna be,ep105
249,easy to find because the rental market,ep105
252,at the moment is pretty crazy more,ep105
255,people are being stationed in this area,ep105
258,the single home that a lot of these,ep105
261,Americans are looking for is the hottest,ep105
264,property around,ep105
267,okay the adventure begins we're coming,ep105
270,to the area of Butch Inigo I think I've,ep105
273,seen the mountains a little bit more yes,ep105
276,yes because you're definitely closer,ep105
279,every other day basically you pass by,ep105
282,the market that's definitely something,ep105
285,I'm picturing going into the market and,ep105
288,you're dropping taking the kiddos yeah,ep105
291,and that's where you pick up a lot of,ep105
294,tiny words - yeah and it helped me out,ep105
297,Rachel's kind of leading the game,ep105
300,I mean she's convinced him to come to,ep105
303,Italy so I'm gonna try to mix the dream,ep105
306,with the practical and hopefully we can,ep105
309,make them come together here we are,ep105
312,oh I like the looks outside cute place,ep105
315,yeah this is a three-bedroom,ep105
318,two-bathroom we have a garden it's a,ep105
321,little bit smaller it is fenced in,ep105
324,though okay we are slightly over budget,ep105
327,that's 900 instead of 850 okay I don't,ep105
330,want to go over budget here we are,ep105
333,okay it's really cold I'm having a,ep105
336,problem with the heating right now it,ep105
339,does take quite a bit to get it warm but,ep105
342,then once it's warm it actually keeps it,ep105
345,quite well I love the details the,ep105
348,ceiling the tile well let's go take a,ep105
351,look at the rest okay here we are in the,ep105
354,dining room a honey big room here,ep105
357,here's a nice spacious place I love the,ep105
360,fireplace and then some of the,ep105
363,continuation of the lights and,ep105
366,everything okay a lot of space I feel,ep105
369,like eating might be a challenge in here,ep105
372,as well,ep105
375,fireplace is there for heating very good,ep105
378,good good to go,ep105
381,I like how open it is it's definitely,ep105
384,bigger than I expect you it's a lot,ep105
387,colder than I expected to take a look at,ep105
390,this bedroom look at all the windows,ep105
393,like the windows that's a church awesome,ep105
396,rhythm ringing uh-huh oh my gosh this is,ep105
399,exactly what I was picturing we're up in,ep105
402,the mountains you can hear those church,ep105
405,bells there's that well down there I,ep105
408,like this I like this room mmm-hmm I,ep105
411,definitely like the mountains we've,ep105
414,heard a lot of church bells going,ep105
417,through the house and I know Richard,ep105
420,really likes them and it goes with the,ep105
423,towering charm but I think it's gonna be,ep105
426,a lot to deal with every day,ep105
429,here's another good sized bedroom yeah,ep105
432,nice views,ep105
435,yeah I think there's enough space and,ep105
438,then we still have our guest bedroom I,ep105
441,like it alakay,ep105
444,I think Rachel's winning this one it's,ep105
447,pretty typical oh this house there's so,ep105
450,many cute details I love the inside and,ep105
453,I can't get enough of this yard it's,ep105
456,smaller than what I want but I can't get,ep105
459,over these trees it just feels like that,ep105
462,Italian living and I was looking for,ep105
465,yeah well I don't have any cell coverage,ep105
468,here and that's gonna be an issue with,ep105
471,me being on call well when we're really,ep105
474,close to the mountains you're gonna have,ep105
477,a little bit of difficulty with that so,ep105
480,it's either mountains or technology,ep105
483,unfortunately would be kind of nice to,ep105
486,get off the grid right I mean there's,ep105
489,some kind of charm to that yeah this,ep105
492,isn't gonna work oh my gosh this is the,ep105
495,perfect Italian house that that charm I,ep105
498,was hoping for and I can picture,ep105
501,speaking some more Italian and getting,ep105
504,the kids down hopefully walking just the,ep105
507,markets yeah I'd be great here but we,ep105
510,need to be realistic,ep105
513,[Music],ep105
516,Sabina finds been a more practical,ep105
519,option we're actually a little bit,ep105
522,closer to work nice,ep105
525,here we are interesting tile work it's,ep105
528,dated I should be getting more on,ep105
531,Italian charm,ep105
534,times have changed everything Aviano is,ep105
537,primarily known for its air base but,ep105
540,what the surrounding area lacks in,ep105
543,tourist hotspots it makes up for in,ep105
546,picturesque views of the dolomite d,ep105
549,mountains a quaint atmosphere and,ep105
552,family-owned wineries can you show,ep105
555,people how you can count in Italian I'll,ep105
558,start Ben and Rachel are relocating,ep105
561,their entire clan for Ben's career as a,ep105
564,military nurse Bravo,ep105
567,Rachel wants the kids to learn to live,ep105
570,like the locals the kids they're,ep105
573,starting to be the age where they might,ep105
576,be able to pick up the language and I'm,ep105
579,super excited to get them the,ep105
582,opportunity to see the world Oh grazie a,ep105
585,sunshine I'm getting warmed up with me,ep105
588,now definitely can get used to life ah,ep105
591,this tune tune to that teen cheating,ep105
594,living overseas that's been a dream of,ep105
597,mine since I was in high school I mean I,ep105
600,definitely want to travel I want to do,ep105
603,the gardening so we'll have some produce,ep105
606,from home tomatoes basil grow it,ep105
609,ourselves and sure it'll be perfect,ep105
612,she's got this picture perfect view of,ep105
615,what she wants then I'm not sure how,ep105
618,realistic all that's going to be do you,ep105
621,think the binos gonna help with the,ep105
624,stress of the move this is definitely,ep105
627,Italian living perfect we are slightly,ep105
630,over budget that's nine hundred instead,ep105
633,of 850 but I love the details it's got,ep105
636,that charm definitely I'm ready to sign,ep105
639,the paperwork but there's no Americans,ep105
642,living around here communicating to,ep105
645,folks it's gonna be a challenge we are,ep105
648,only 10 minutes from the base close to,ep105
651,word nice but there's no cell coverage,ep105
654,part of my job is being on the call I,ep105
657,don't think it's not work,ep105
660,I think I'm going to have to push a,ep105
663,little bit more towards been inside now,ep105
666,and try to find something a bit more,ep105
669,practical maybe even you know a bit more,ep105
672,convenient here we're actually a little,ep105
675,bit closer to work Ben your honor,ep105
678,because we're in Aviano you could,ep105
681,probably even bike to work I like that,ep105
684,idea,ep105
687,are there a lot of Americans in Aviano I,ep105
690,heard that there are there are yes they,ep105
693,definitely do cater to Americans so you,ep105
696,may not be getting that typical feel of,ep105
699,the little Italian town this is a,ep105
702,3-bedroom 2bath you are only five,ep105
705,minutes from base like that it has,ep105
708,Princeton Yard and space for your,ep105
711,vegetable garden perfect but we're at,ep105
714,950 a month since I'm not working I,ep105
717,really didn't want to go over budget I,ep105
720,think you might like it,ep105
723,let's go take a look I can lock here we,ep105
726,are yeah definitely like all the wood,ep105
729,this is the living and dining room next,ep105
732,size yeah I like the height of the,ep105
735,ceilings too window brings in quite a,ep105
738,bit of light huh mm-hmm Thanks,ep105
741,let me show you the kitchen okay okay no,ep105
744,tiles interesting that's nice a little,ep105
747,small yes fine we used to no drawers for,ep105
750,silverware that's different I never,ep105
753,noticed that maybe you could make like a,ep105
756,makeshift Troyer or something well not,ep105
759,too much charm it's not fair that you,ep105
762,get to have everything you want do you,ep105
765,always get what you are wide is there,ep105
768,what I want this is one of the bedrooms,ep105
771,kind of interesting tile work next size,ep105
774,though two of the bedrooms are right,ep105
777,next to each other up here the other one,ep105
780,is downstairs,ep105
783,okay so here you have a nice-sized,ep105
786,bathroom with a nice big bathtub nice,ep105
789,good access for the kids in the tub not,ep105
792,a ton of storage space though there's,ep105
795,something you can put under the sink or,ep105
798,even outside in the hallway son here we,ep105
801,have the other bedroom yep definitely,ep105
804,lunch space have the window out there,ep105
807,too,ep105
810,garden is that the driveway right down,ep105
813,there yeah the window that's right out,ep105
816,fun yeah okay maybe we'd have to take,ep105
819,this room instead of the kids just for,ep105
822,safety yeah in case they figure out,ep105
825,let's take a look downstairs then all,ep105
828,right in Italy we call the satavahana,ep105
831,but I guess that would be a den for you,ep105
834,guys yeah I like it a fireplace in the,ep105
837,corner I think the TV would fit on top,ep105
840,of it I think so too,ep105
843,what do you guys think I'm super stoked,ep105
846,about the yard and the garden aspects,ep105
849,but don't like that it's over budget I,ep105
852,mean the hundred dollars over a month it,ep105
855,does that off I'll be riding my bike to,ep105
858,work so we'll be saving some gas money,ep105
861,that way I like the house though I think,ep105
864,this place checks up a lot of boxes for,ep105
867,men they just wishes give more than,ep105
870,Italian charm,ep105
873,feel that I was hoping for and I don't,ep105
876,want to go over budget I think if I left,ep105
879,it to Rachel we'd be living far away,ep105
882,from work and we'd be lucky to have,ep105
885,anybody speak English there the struggle,ep105
888,remains the same it's cute and it's on,ep105
891,budget but it's a little far from the,ep105
894,base one of them has to compromise,ep105
897,somewhere,ep105
900,[Music],ep105
903,cakehole aureus you say it in Italian oh,ep105
906,yeah you don't know Ben's landed a,ep105
909,transfer to Aviano Italy and Rachel,ep105
912,couldn't be happier,ep105
915,will this be nice when we go up in the,ep105
918,mountains yeah living overseas is what I,ep105
921,wanted I'm excited I can't picture,ep105
924,anything better,ep105
927,Ben's more cautious moves are stressful,ep105
930,and I'm worried about the kids but he,ep105
933,sees the upside too distant out the,ep105
936,worst person in the DC area it wasn't,ep105
939,really an option to take the kids skiing,ep105
942,baby girl and so now that we're moving,ep105
945,here and the mountains being so close,ep105
948,and it's just a dream come true however,ep105
951,their home search has been anything but,ep105
954,from the start,ep105
957,oh I like the looks outside Rachel wants,ep105
960,the Italian style in an Italian area 900,ep105
963,instead of 850 and we are losing an,ep105
966,income so I would prefer to stay under,ep105
969,budget but it's really cute it's got,ep105
972,that charm definitely ah I like this a,ep105
975,lot it was close enough to the base,ep105
978,where it's not gonna be a problem for,ep105
981,Ben but we don't have any cell coverage,ep105
984,in the house I need to be on call for,ep105
987,work that's gonna be a problem we are,ep105
990,exactly where ven needs to be for his,ep105
993,work we were like that tiles interesting,ep105
996,it's dated but I've been really wanting,ep105
999,for a little more Italian charm and,ep105
1002,culture we're at 950 a month I don't,ep105
1005,want to go over budget I chose this,ep105
1008,house because I think it really added up,ep105
1011,to what they were looking for with the,ep105
1014,mountain views and the Italian,ep105
1017,characteristics and it is within the,ep105
1020,budget so we're going to be seeing place,ep105
1023,in,ep105
1026,being on all that this is one of his,ep105
1029,little Italian towns,ep105
1032,this is picturesque Italian village this,ep105
1035,is what I want beautiful yeah it seems,ep105
1038,like we've been driving a lot yeah it is,ep105
1041,a bit further out this one this is a,ep105
1044,two-family home okay yeah it might be,ep105
1047,hard this is three bedrooms two,ep105
1050,bathrooms but you have a really big,ep105
1053,garden it's all fenced in so it's good,ep105
1056,for the kids love the yard,ep105
1059,remember we are sharing that yard goes,ep105
1062,into the family it also seems like a,ep105
1065,busy road yeah different times of the,ep105
1068,day yeah it can be a bit busy we are at,ep105
1071,about 30 minutes away from the base oh,ep105
1074,okay,ep105
1077,but we're right on budget 850 a month oh,ep105
1080,wow perfect here we are the door noticed,ep105
1083,exposed brick actually it's open no,ep105
1086,little gas you yes open space that's a,ep105
1089,bit more of a modern touch the wood,ep105
1092,flooring yeah beautiful this is also,ep105
1095,very typical that's called Cocteau it's,ep105
1098,like a polished terracotta so again very,ep105
1101,low-maintenance and you have a beautiful,ep105
1104,fireplace in the corner love the,ep105
1107,fireplace don't know if our characters,ep105
1110,gonna fit here but definitely has that,ep105
1113,Italian charm it's very beautiful this,ep105
1116,is considered a living kitchen yeah it's,ep105
1119,a little tiny bit different space than,ep105
1122,what you're used to,ep105
1125,I can see us eating here that you have a,ep105
1128,normal stove that is also a wood-burning,ep105
1131,stove I love that it's kind of neat,ep105
1134,different well this is kind of,ep105
1137,convenient I mean I can get a I view on,ep105
1140,the kiddos when they're always listening,ep105
1143,and behaving like angels that they offer,ep105
1146,I like this home a little more it's got,ep105
1149,some of that charm definitely gives me,ep105
1152,that battalion country feel that I'm,ep105
1155,looking for in the back here you'll have,ep105
1158,a little bathroom,ep105
1161,oh good size works for the kids up,ep105
1164,shower close to the kitchen should work,ep105
1167,well yeah nice in the process of potty,ep105
1170,training the more toilets the better,ep105
1173,especially so this is where we get to,ep105
1176,the bedrooms,ep105
1179,very nurse,ep105
1182,space you can have a bed and the closet,ep105
1185,so they find solutions to smaller spaces,ep105
1188,right and the master bedroom find a big,ep105
1191,agent like that we we'd be fighting over,ep105
1194,the room I think again you're the,ep105
1197,exposed brick so a little bit of rustic,ep105
1200,style and this is just for you Rachel,ep105
1203,wow this is gorgeous beautiful a little,ep105
1206,noisy out here with the road just space,ep105
1209,this way when you drink to per seconds,ep105
1212,we just sing over this house is so cute,ep105
1215,I like the details throughout the house,ep105
1218,but it doesn't seem right for our family,ep105
1221,here we are keep your gloves ready yes,ep105
1224,perfect see you already have the soils,ep105
1227,all ready for you huh perfect man I,ep105
1230,can't get over this yard it's gorgeous,ep105
1233,and it's a house above the charm I mean,ep105
1236,it's cute and it's on budget so we'll be,ep105
1239,able to save that money but little small,ep105
1242,space wise it's a neat little place but,ep105
1245,we're gonna be sharing the yard with,ep105
1248,another family as well if you don't get,ep105
1251,along it could be a little bit awkward,ep105
1254,well I think we're a really nice family,ep105
1257,and we'll just bring them over a,ep105
1260,Prosecco and problem solved that's how I,ep105
1263,get along with you in real noisy Road,ep105
1266,and it's a little far from the base,ep105
1269,potentially but I love that patio and I,ep105
1272,can see some of those points but I,ep105
1275,definitely think Finn's gonna have to be,ep105
1278,flexible grater really likes the fact,ep105
1281,that this house is on budget and it's,ep105
1284,got that Italian charm definitely maybe,ep105
1287,sometimes better to let her have what,ep105
1290,she wants,ep105
1293,the mountain village home was so,ep105
1296,charming I just loved it but we need to,ep105
1299,be realistic we hate being realistic,ep105
1302,this is Aviano down here oh that is,ep105
1305,gorgeous yeah Ben's military nursing job,ep105
1308,has brought his entire family to Aviano,ep105
1311,Italy I still pinching myself I can't,ep105
1314,believe we're gonna be actually living,ep105
1317,in Rachel's eager to fully immerse them,ep105
1320,into Italian culture in their new home,ep105
1323,what are we gonna do no I think we need,ep105
1326,to think about this logically but he,ep105
1329,wants to stick to what they know closer,ep105
1332,to his work the mountain village house,ep105
1335,was a little over budget but I just,ep105
1338,loved it this is exactly what I was,ep105
1341,picturing it was close to your job it,ep105
1344,definitely had that charm and then the,ep105
1347,village that was so close that's what we,ep105
1350,came for it just feels like that Italian,ep105
1353,living I was looking for but let's be,ep105
1356,realistic there's no cell coverage in,ep105
1359,that town this is a little bit isolated,ep105
1362,the house in town was the most over,ep105
1365,budget yeah but I'd be close to work,ep105
1368,I'm gonna be ready my bike interesting,ep105
1371,Tyler this doesn't quite have the,ep105
1374,Italian charm that I was hoping,ep105
1377,important the two family home it was the,ep105
1380,only house that was on budget 850 mm oh,ep105
1383,wow perfect a little tiny and I like,ep105
1386,some of the little characters with some,ep105
1389,modern touches no I want that yard is it,ep105
1392,perfect but we're gonna be sharing the,ep105
1395,yard is about 30 minutes away from the,ep105
1398,base okay but it's too far from work,ep105
1401,[Music],ep105
1404,I think we're gonna have to drop the one,ep105
1407,with the long commute the two family,ep105
1410,home mm-hmm I mean sharing a house that,ep105
1413,would be kind of challenging especially,ep105
1416,with the kids I think those would have a,ep105
1419,lot of drawbacks so the house in town I,ep105
1422,think the location to work is going to,ep105
1425,be perfect that was the most over-budget,ep105
1428,a hundred bucks a month yeah but I'd be,ep105
1431,able to ride my bike or walk to work so,ep105
1434,we'd be saving money that way it also,ep105
1437,has that garden that you really wanted,ep105
1440,that was awesome,ep105
1443,but it also kind of had him a lot more,ep105
1446,Americans around I feel like it lost,ep105
1449,some of that Italian praise much and I,ep105
1452,really was hoping for well remember they,ep105
1455,have the market there once a week so I,ep105
1458,think you could practice your Italian,ep105
1461,there mm-hmm and then of course there's,ep105
1464,the mountain village home it's got,ep105
1467,basically everything I feel like I'm a,ep105
1470,wish list it was close enough to work,ep105
1473,still have the fenced-in garden but,ep105
1476,church bells it was just girl Mantic and,ep105
1479,the mountains with their views was love,ep105
1482,the yard and garden were a little bit,ep105
1485,smaller than we wanted and also there's,ep105
1488,no cell service and I need to be on call,ep105
1491,for work so it was just so hard I know,ep105
1494,but I think we need to be realistic,ep105
1497,about this I don't like being realistic,ep105
1500,I guess if we are and we probably should,ep105
1503,choose the house in town it meets most,ep105
1506,of our criteria and you bicycling to,ep105
1509,work would be really nice it's gonna be,ep105
1512,great and I think it's gonna be a good,ep105
1515,fit for us mm-hmm,ep105
1518,[Music],ep105
1521,do you guys want more ingest sit,ep105
1524,Clementi me proof of alright living here,ep105
1527,it's still a drinking,ep105
1530,but if anything it's better than what I,ep105
1533,imagined be doing neither see you ready,ep105
1536,to go kiddos so not having to commute so,ep105
1539,far I'm actually getting more time at,ep105
1542,home with the kids,ep105
1545,hey do you remember when we went,ep105
1548,shopping at the market we bought pasta,ep105
1551,and carrots at the market today the,ep105
1554,house is working really well for us,ep105
1557,it's actually bigger than a place in,ep105
1560,Alexandria there definitely are some,ep105
1563,things I was sorry to still hoping to,ep105
1566,get it's not quite as much Italian charm,ep105
1569,and I was hoping to be a little further,ep105
1572,out with more Italian neighbors but I'm,ep105
1575,happy with the home,ep105
1578,they're friendly once something with,ep105
1581,Rachel 75 wins 2-1 finally can you show,ep105
1584,mommy Lube Achille so now that means I,ep105
1587,get to win everything else in Italy,ep105
1590,right,ep105
1593,[Music],ep105
12,oh wow I love this nice newlyweds Morgan,ep106
15,and chase have big plans for their first,ep106
18,home in the Salt Lake City area now this,ep106
21,is what I'm talking about I do love that,ep106
24,it's fully enclosed it makes it so it's,ep106
27,dog ready for Morgan it has to be new,ep106
30,and very tidy you have to do this right,ep106
33,now I'm obsessed with cleaning oh I,ep106
36,noticed carpet I would love to have the,ep106
39,would carry through a country cottage,ep106
42,with room for improvement tops his list,ep106
45,my porch this is exactly what he's been,ep106
48,looking for plenty of room,ep106
51,it's definitely Church space just still,ep106
54,feels like a dungeon it's so dark can,ep106
57,they find middle ground this is nothing,ep106
60,like I imagined,ep106
63,[Music],ep106
66,so definitely want one of the milk pecan,ep106
69,turtles I'm Morgan I'm chase and we live,ep106
72,in Sandy Utah some of these milk,ep106
75,macadamia those look pretty good I work,ep106
78,for a local TV station in Salt Lake City,ep106
81,I'm the morning reporter so really early,ep106
84,hours 4:30 till 9 o'clock in the morning,ep106
87,you'd look more elegant eating chocolate,ep106
90,than me yeah I'm an enterprise account,ep106
93,executive and help companies with,ep106
96,digital media and digital marketing this,ep106
99,one's the winner,ep106
102,we met at college it was my first day as,ep106
105,a journalist on campus and chase,ep106
108,approached me and asked if I needed help,ep106
111,and I did and so he was my very first,ep106
114,interview so it'd be perfect for the,ep106
117,pumpkin launcher that wasn't like we had,ep106
120,like an initial attraction to one,ep106
123,another geez,ep106
126,shots fired yeah I was just about she,ep106
129,was pretty yeah a year later then we,ep106
132,ended up dating and six years later we,ep106
135,got married think so,ep106
138,Morgan is very particular about,ep106
141,everything I'm obsessed with cleaning,ep106
144,she always cleans at the most,ep106
147,inopportune times when I'm watching the,ep106
150,game or I'm like really into something,ep106
153,kids are coming back in you have to do,ep106
156,this right now chase is very thoughtful,ep106
159,and is constantly giving on his time,ep106
162,people need help laughs oh this is so,ep106
165,pretty I love this high kick Utah is,ep106
168,absolutely amazing from mica scenery,ep106
171,perspective especially during fall time,ep106
174,on all the trees or changing colors we,ep106
177,love being outdoors and Utah's perfect,ep106
180,for that and that's why we want to raise,ep106
183,our family here I love this one kind of,ep106
186,that simple cottage look that I was,ep106
189,describing our country cottage home is,ep106
192,kind of what I've always envisioned as a,ep106
195,perfect family home,ep106
198,I want that wraparound porch yeah,ep106
201,it's kind of weird it's like modern but,ep106
204,it's almost too modern my style of home,ep106
207,is completely opposite than chase I want,ep106
210,something feels new but it has a little,ep106
213,bit more of a classic and traditional,ep106
216,and look to it look at the new,ep106
219,appliances that's nice,ep106
222,I want a brand new move-in-ready home I,ep106
225,don't want to have to fix anything so I,ep106
228,want to be able to walk in place the,ep106
231,furniture down of course after cleaning,ep106
234,or as I'm the opposite I kind of want to,ep106
237,do the work myself so I can get the,ep106
240,value for it later before 3:00 so it's,ep106
243,all white all white kitchen for kitchen,ep106
246,I want the white kitchen I want modern,ep106
249,appliances a granite countertop the,ep106
252,carpet I really really want carpet I,ep106
255,feel like it kind of makes it a little,ep106
258,bit more cozy somebody else's old carpet,ep106
261,creeps me out,ep106
264,even if it is clean professionally I'm,ep106
267,really all for hardwood floors I'll just,ep106
270,buy you some slippers they do agree on,ep106
273,"keeping the budget under $400,000 and",ep106
276,having at least three beds and two baths,ep106
279,the areas that we're looking at are,ep106
282,close to family so that's in Davis,ep106
285,County it's also an area that sits in,ep106
288,between two major cities often in Salt,ep106
291,Lake City so if we need that night,ep106
294,lifestyle we can you know it's just a,ep106
297,quick drive up the street very big,ep106
300,backyard yeah huge fenced yard actually,ep106
303,is a big thing because we would love a,ep106
306,dog - ideally we're kind of looking for,ep106
309,a patio or a deck as well a fireplace,ep106
312,for her and three-car garage for him are,ep106
315,also on their list it's on my wish list,ep106
318,to have a basement because want to have,ep106
321,a space where I can watch TV and she's,ep106
324,not gonna come in and vacuum in the,ep106
327,middle of it now it was a perfect time,ep106
330,for us to look for a home because we've,ep106
333,not only outgrown where we currently are,ep106
336,but it's kind of time to start laying,ep106
339,that foundation for where we want to,ep106
342,move toward our future with the dock and,ep106
345,kids eventually Wow look at the dark,ep106
348,first first up a house in Kaysville just,ep106
351,10 minutes from their family come on,ep106
354,guys get on in here,ep106
357,let's get,ep106
360,today we're going to see a new,ep106
363,traditional home fits very well into,ep106
366,what Morgan has been looking for this is,ep106
369,a brand new build house no one's ever,ep106
372,lived in it before she is going to fall,ep106
375,in love with it because of that it's,ep106
378,called sorry about the wind it is a bear,ep106
381,today oh wow it's not so new it is new,ep106
384,the new traditional home just what I,ep106
387,want three bedrooms high end of your,ep106
390,price range it's 399 nine there's an $85,ep106
393,HOA fee but I think you're gonna love,ep106
396,the house also Donna said there wasn't a,ep106
399,true wraparound porch you do have the,ep106
402,pillars out front which gives you that,ep106
405,nice country kind of a state kind of a,ep106
408,feel these homes look a lot alike,ep106
411,it's a Planned Unit development so the,ep106
414,homes are all similar styles,ep106
417,they're all back loaded you didn't see a,ep106
420,garage out front the garages are all in,ep106
423,the back of the house and you share,ep106
426,common driveway together that's why you,ep106
429,don't see as many fences but you're,ep106
432,allowed to have a fence if you want one,ep106
435,there's absolutely no yard with this,ep106
438,house about that fenced yard I don't,ep106
441,know that it's really something I would,ep106
444,consider it's kind of a deal-breaker for,ep106
447,me oh I noticed carpet it gets a warm,ep106
450,feeling to the house don't you think I,ep106
453,love that it's clean and new,ep106
456,I would love though to have the would,ep106
459,carry through this room I've also got a,ep106
462,coat closet as you come into the hallway,ep106
465,and then your guest back in here there's,ep106
468,a nice bathroom it really is oh wow I,ep106
471,love this this is nice and I love that,ep106
474,we have the hardwood floors yeah I do,ep106
477,love like the actual fixtures as well I,ep106
480,love the fireplace,ep106
483,oh keep me nice and warm during the,ep106
486,winter I would hope that it would be a,ep106
489,little bit bigger,ep106
492,I'm just for company but it's really not,ep106
495,bad this is beautiful this is nice this,ep106
498,is a almost six foot by 10 foot piece of,ep106
501,granite so this is one solid piece of,ep106
504,granite lots of space and it's all brand,ep106
507,new I do like the paint even though I,ep106
510,had wanted white I feel like it would,ep106
513,work,ep106
516,Morgan absolutely loves this house fact,ep106
519,that it is newer it's gonna be really,ep106
522,difficult to kind of pull her away from,ep106
525,this one,ep106
528,I see lots of carpet does this carpet,ep106
531,carry throughout all of the upstairs Oh,ep106
534,everywhere but your bathrooms in your,ep106
537,laundry room but you've got a big open,ep106
540,area right as you come up the stairs I,ep106
543,like it,ep106
546,well let's go take a look at the master,ep106
549,suite oh wow this is big very spacious,ep106
552,here I'll fall and you have this nook,ep106
555,here maybe for a desk,ep106
558,yeah desk or future bassinet maybe or,ep106
561,the doggy bed or the doggy bed wow look,ep106
564,at this tile and the dual vanities and,ep106
567,this granite countertop it's nice and,ep106
570,white and bright and that's a massive,ep106
573,closet as well,ep106
576,that's huge plenty of room for shoes,ep106
579,this is the closet I'm looking for they,ep106
582,see two more bedrooms this space isn't,ep106
585,too bad for a small child but for a,ep106
588,ghast room it might not work this is a,ep106
591,gas bath yeah this would be your guest,ep106
594,bath this isn't bad yeah that's a,ep106
597,granite countertops and the tile all new,ep106
600,and updated and I like it they head,ep106
603,downstairs to see the basement Oh plenty,ep106
606,of room,ep106
609,it's definitely Church the place yeah,ep106
612,it's a lot of work ahead of you,ep106
615,I like it though this is my kind of,ep106
618,house this is that new traditional look,ep106
621,to that I want it's perfect for me it,ep106
624,offers the three-car garage the fact,ep106
627,that it doesn't have a yard I think,ep106
630,that's my biggest issue with the house,ep106
633,but it looks just like I ever dreamed of,ep106
636,having a home one thing I've yet to see,ep106
639,though is that country cottage feel that,ep106
642,I was really hoping for so now their,ep106
645,agents come through and found a house,ep106
648,that's Chase's style that's what you,ep106
651,were looking for right it was a little,ep106
654,drive to get here but definitely has,ep106
657,that country cottage feel I was hoping,ep106
660,for,ep106
663,because I can see the whole state from,ep106
666,this one part as excited as newlyweds,ep106
669,chase and Morgan are to buy their first,ep106
672,home in the Salt Lake City area agreeing,ep106
675,on what they want has been a challenge,ep106
678,"working with a budget of $400,000",ep106
681,they've seen a traditional new build,ep106
684,that she likes but it didn't have a,ep106
687,backyard or the cozy cottage feel he,ep106
690,wants so now they're in the town of,ep106
693,Magna 45 minutes away from their family,ep106
696,to see an option that might be better,ep106
699,suited for chase it's beautiful,ep106
702,there's only a car garage though well,ep106
705,hey guys I love the porch that's for,ep106
708,sure what you were looking for right it,ep106
711,was a little drive to get here but,ep106
714,definitely has that country cottage feel,ep106
717,I was hoping for it's five bedrooms,ep106
720,three baths it's on a half an acre of,ep106
723,land what price range are we looking at,ep106
726,it's a four hundred and fourteen,ep106
729,thousand dollars it better be close to,ep106
732,perfect mark going inside my porch this,ep106
735,is exactly what he's been looking for,ep106
738,mark I absolutely loved the wraparound,ep106
741,porch I'm certainly willing to,ep106
744,compromise though being further away,ep106
747,from family because it has that country,ep106
750,cottage feel that I like so far I like,ep106
753,all the hardwood this is definitely an,ep106
756,older house it is it's very spacious,ep106
759,nihilist,ep106
762,I do like kind of this grand staircase,ep106
765,although the carpet would definitely,ep106
768,need to be replaced,ep106
771,the first thing I notice has the,ep106
774,fireplace you're wanting that's exactly,ep106
777,right yeah it's a it's cozy let's take a,ep106
780,look at the dining room first you've got,ep106
783,a very spacious dining room in here it's,ep106
786,perfect for hosting parties I can see,ep106
789,Christmas happening right here,ep106
792,well should we take a look at the,ep106
795,kitchen let's do that so does this wood,ep106
798,carry throughout the house it does,ep106
801,through all the main level yes now the,ep106
804,one thing I'm seeing though is projects,ep106
807,I wanted to be able to move in and for,ep106
810,it to all look brand-new and I don't,ep106
813,mind the projects but definitely love,ep106
816,the layout so it's like the right,ep106
819,mixture of being modern and having that,ep106
822,cottage fill it is one of those houses I,ep106
825,think you get the investment out of,ep106
828,though as you put the time into it and a,ep106
831,little bit of work on your own,ep106
834,I can see chases excitement he's like a,ep106
837,little boy in this house he wants that,ep106
840,project but with it being at the top of,ep106
843,our price point I just don't know that I,ep106
846,can compromise Wow now this is what I'm,ep106
849,talking about,ep106
852,great entertaining space I love this,ep106
855,huge deck and you have a huge patio and,ep106
858,great lawn you've got a half acre of,ep106
861,land out here you mentioned having a,ep106
864,garden just picture it of sitting over,ep106
867,there in the corner I love this backyard,ep106
870,I do love that it's fully enclosed it,ep106
873,makes it so it's dog ready really this,ep106
876,also leads right into the master bedroom,ep106
879,okay oh this carpet definitely need to,ep106
882,be taken out I do love the space like it,ep106
885,is very spacious this is the closet this,ep106
888,is the master closet this isn't bad,ep106
891,spacious yeah plenty of room for my,ep106
894,shoes on the master baths right around,ep106
897,the corner wow this is another project,ep106
900,it definitely needs some updating and,ep106
903,the jetted tub is nice and a double,ep106
906,vanities night as well has the his and,ep106
909,hers for you,ep106
912,they look at another bedroom this,ep106
915,actually would be a perfect office,ep106
918,upstairs they look at a full bath and,ep106
921,two bedrooms awkwardly shaped but not,ep106
924,bad,ep106
927,lots of space to work with when I,ep106
930,actually love that uniqueness I love,ep106
933,that cottage shape that it has they head,ep106
936,downstairs to see the basement it looks,ep106
939,like someone already got started for me,ep106
942,yeah I mean they've started to build you,ep106
945,of your own kitchen in here Hey look,ep106
948,they've even started on a fireplace for,ep106
951,you oh I do like that it just still,ep106
954,feels like a dungeon it's so dark I like,ep106
957,it it definitely screams chase space all,ep106
960,over it,ep106
963,[Applause],ep106
966,[Music],ep106
969,well it's gonna definitely need some,ep106
972,renovation on the inside I don't see,ep106
975,anything modern about this place it's a,ep106
978,perfect project house by all means the,ep106
981,layout the actual country cottage ville,ep106
984,but that front yard and the backyard I,ep106
987,absolutely love,ep106
990,we are still 4550 minutes away from,ep106
993,family now they're seeing a house that's,ep106
996,closer to where they want to be but it,ep106
999,may not be move-in ready either the blue,ep106
1002,door that might have to check there's,ep106
1005,where the paint comes in,ep106
1008,[Music],ep106
1011,orders piling them all newlyweds Jason,ep106
1014,Morgan are ready to put down roots in,ep106
1017,the Salt Lake City area but have,ep106
1020,different priorities for their first,ep106
1023,"home working with a $400,000 budget",ep106
1026,they've seen a traditional new build for,ep106
1029,her but it didn't have the backyard he,ep106
1032,wants then they saw a country cottage on,ep106
1035,a half acre of land with plenty of,ep106
1038,projects for Chase but it wasn't move-in,ep106
1041,ready enough for her so now they're ten,ep106
1044,minutes from family in Clearfield to see,ep106
1047,a contemporary house what's the price,ep106
1050,range three thirty nine nine so it's,ep106
1053,well below what we've been looking for,ep106
1056,gives you room to make changes if,ep106
1059,there's things that you don't like or,ep106
1062,things that Chase wants like the,ep106
1065,three-car Garage let's chase you're,ep106
1068,gonna love the three-car Garage aren't,ep106
1071,ya and the blue door that might have to,ep106
1074,change there's where the paint comes in,ep106
1077,overall I think this house definitely,ep106
1080,provides that three-car garage that I,ep106
1083,was looking for but one thing that I,ep106
1086,really want is kind of that wraparound,ep106
1089,porch which is something this house,ep106
1092,doesn't offer to come on in oh my gosh,ep106
1095,look at all this hardwood floor Wow it,ep106
1098,was beautiful I love that there's no,ep106
1101,carpet in this dining room and the,ep106
1104,shutters are nice too what do you think,ep106
1107,of the paint yeah that's something,ep106
1110,that's gonna need to be fixed it's a,ep106
1113,cheap fix and I'm always okay with that,ep106
1116,well I love this grand room I love that,ep106
1119,it's just one great room be better,ep106
1122,though if the recessed lighting carried,ep106
1125,out through about the entire house so,ep106
1128,maybe that's something we could do in,ep106
1131,the future I do love these wide-open,ep106
1134,windows gives great light just they,ep106
1137,don't see a fireplace yeah it was one of,ep106
1140,those things I could not get well that,ep106
1143,just might have to be something we,ep106
1146,compromise on they step outside to see,ep106
1149,the yard oh I love it nice that it's,ep106
1152,fully fenced it would be perfect for a,ep106
1155,dog take a look at this why you don't,ep106
1158,have a fireplace inside you do have a,ep106
1161,fire pit outside so you can still gather,ep106
1164,around and enjoy that yeah perfect for,ep106
1167,hosting I love their garden too yeah,ep106
1170,this is a bonus,ep106
1173,but one thing I love about this kitchen,ep106
1176,is the open concept the one thing though,ep106
1179,it's lacking is those white cabinets,ep106
1182,they actually kind of like that wood the,ep106
1185,kitchen is an ideal we don't have the,ep106
1188,white cabinets don't have the granite,ep106
1191,countertops the house isn't perfect but,ep106
1194,it is turnkey they're able to move in,ep106
1197,here and make changes as they go it's,ep106
1200,simple things and I think they can,ep106
1203,really personalize the house to their,ep106
1206,needs I love it I love that it's,ep106
1209,unfinished really is the chaise space it,ep106
1212,just it feels like a dungeon down here,ep106
1215,you do have some natural lighting down,ep106
1218,here so it does keep it a little less,ep106
1221,dungeon esque they head to the second,ep106
1224,floor to see the master oh this is small,ep106
1227,yeah not ideal I do like the carpet I'm,ep106
1230,not really a fan of this carpet yeah the,ep106
1233,carpet will have to be torn out what,ep106
1236,about the bathroom this room needs an,ep106
1239,update,ep106
1242,yeah definitely some TLC the vanity is a,ep106
1245,lot older I think one of the biggest,ep106
1248,things honestly though this bathroom is,ep106
1251,missing is the his-and-her sinks the,ep106
1254,master bath is a complete renovation,ep106
1257,project and it's definitely a deal,ep106
1260,breaker for me,ep106
1263,and the master bathroom is really,ep106
1266,outdated so it's gonna require a lot of,ep106
1269,work but I love that it's under budget,ep106
1272,so it would definitely be an ideal,ep106
1275,opportunity to actually appreciate the,ep106
1278,value of the home wow this is just what,ep106
1281,I'm looking for nice and spacious well,ep106
1284,this is just one of three extra bedrooms,ep106
1287,that you have in the house actually like,ep106
1290,it may be an office space it'll,ep106
1293,definitely have the paint it they look,ep106
1296,at two more bedrooms stripes again this,ep106
1299,house is gonna really need a lot of,ep106
1302,paint,ep106
1305,it's definitely modernized but it has,ep106
1308,that traditional feel I like it,ep106
1311,I love the unfinished basement what's,ep106
1314,open for a little bit more that,ep106
1317,cottageville that wraparound porch that,ep106
1320,I've always wanted I was really hoping,ep106
1323,for the white cabinetry in the kitchen,ep106
1326,and the fireplace in the family room do,ep106
1329,you like the fact though that has the,ep106
1332,three-car garage the fully fenced back,ep106
1335,yard a lot of projects that's kind of,ep106
1338,kanata up quickly but I like that under,ep106
1341,budget okay with several options in mind,ep106
1344,they'll need to decide what's more,ep106
1347,important having a large yard no,ep106
1350,projects or being close to family we,ep106
1353,have a lot to think about,ep106
1356,beautiful all these fall colors yeah,ep106
1359,newlyweds Jason Morgan are looking for,ep106
1362,their first house in Salt Lake City,ep106
1365,"working with a budget of $400,000",ep106
1368,they've seen several options and are,ep106
1371,ready to decide first up a traditional,ep106
1374,new build this home is absolutely,ep106
1377,perfect for me it's brand-new and I love,ep106
1380,being able to just move in it's on the,ep106
1383,higher price point coming in at the 399,ep106
1386,but does have that fireplace and the,ep106
1389,hardwood flooring that I'm looking for,ep106
1392,it doesn't have the yard to actually,ep106
1395,grow into there would be no room for,ep106
1398,your dog or to play with kids outside,ep106
1401,eventually but that's their three-car,ep106
1404,garage it certainly is a longer commute,ep106
1407,at least we're closer to family next,ep106
1410,they saw a house that was Chase's style,ep106
1413,priced at four hundred and fourteen,ep106
1416,thousand dollars I absolutely love that,ep106
1419,country cottage field I definitely love,ep106
1422,the backyard the patio and the deck were,ep106
1425,huge the house is much bigger than all,ep106
1428,the homes that were looking at in terms,ep106
1431,of total square footage but it's so far,ep106
1434,from family being 4550 minutes away from,ep106
1437,them I actually don't like the fact,ep106
1440,either that they have a two-car garage,ep106
1443,there are a few projects inside the,ep106
1446,house that I'm not sure I want to,ep106
1449,compromise on definitely provides that,ep106
1452,potential long-term vision I think that,ep106
1455,I want then a contemporary house the,ep106
1458,house with the blue door that we saw I,ep106
1461,absolutely love it's just so much work,ep106
1464,inside with the paint and that master,ep106
1467,"bath coming in at 340,000 we have plenty",ep106
1470,of room to actually put in those,ep106
1473,renovations so that's good it does have,ep106
1476,a nice backyard fenced and it's enough,ep106
1479,space to be able to host people well,ep106
1482,definitely love the three-car garage I,ep106
1485,think the best thing about that house,ep106
1488,too is it's super close to family it's,ep106
1491,only about 10-15 minutes away so which,ep106
1494,one are you leaning towards,ep106
1497,[Music],ep106
1500,despite the few updates that it'll need,ep106
1503,the one with the blue door it has that,ep106
1506,new traditional look that I want can't,ep106
1509,believe I'm saying this but I think,ep106
1512,that's a perfect balance between the,ep106
1515,projects that I want and being moving,ep106
1518,ready did we just make a decision,ep106
1521,I think we did adulthood here we come,ep106
1524,our first home let's make an offer these,ep106
1527,Tomatoes I wanted this plant we paid the,ep106
1530,original and full asking price of three,ep106
1533,hundred and forty thousand dollars for,ep106
1536,this home and we moved in two months ago,ep106
1539,look at that we're already rolling we,ep106
1542,chose this home because it was a good,ep106
1545,compromise between Morgan and I and,ep106
1548,although there are a few projects that,ep106
1551,we'll have to encounter for the most,ep106
1554,part we were able to just move right in,ep106
1557,those are gonna be perfect for salsa we,ep106
1560,absolutely love the new garden and the,ep106
1563,space how we were able to actually make,ep106
1566,some salsa with some of the tomatoes,ep106
1569,that we picked we're off to an early,ep106
1572,start nice to have all the extra space,ep106
1575,huh the biggest thing before moving in,ep106
1578,was to make sure that each of the rooms,ep106
1581,were painted it was quite a process but,ep106
1584,at least we were able to take care of it,ep106
1587,before moving in furniture carpet kind,ep106
1590,of creeped me out so we just made sure,ep106
1593,that we cleaned it really well before,ep106
1596,moving in excited to be entertaining,ep106
1599,everyone yes finally the wraparound,ep106
1602,porch I think is the biggest thing that,ep106
1605,I did not get that I really wanted I,ep106
1608,really wanted a fireplace and a white,ep106
1611,kitchen but down the line I'd love to,ep106
1614,maybe change some things put in some,ep106
1617,granite countertops and maybe paint one,ep106
1620,of the biggest projects we have is that,ep106
1623,master bath it'll be a complete gut job,ep106
1626,well harsh well it's true hey can I get,ep106
1629,anyone anything else my plans for the,ep106
1632,chaise space are to make a custom,ep106
1635,theater downstairs perfect spot just to,ep106
1638,have people over and kind of host them,ep106
1641,all right let's have a toast being so,ep106
1644,close to family now it has completely,ep106
1647,changed our lives and we do want to,ep106
1650,eventually start a family so it's even,ep106
1653,nicer that we're so close to them we're,ep106
1656,really glad honestly to be around all of,ep106
1659,you but now that we're here it's time,ep106
1662,for a dog,ep106
1665,right well maybe it'll be something we,ep106
1668,come for my son I did say what in the,ep106
1671,house you could get a dog it's on camera,ep106
1674,you heard,ep106
12,janna isn't quite ready to settle down I,ep107
15,kind of just want it to be able to go,ep107
18,experience something new so she's headed,ep107
21,to Spain with her dog my knee where a,ep107
24,job teaching English is waiting in a,ep107
27,sleepy southwestern town Stevens my,ep107
30,boyfriend and he's not moving with me,ep107
33,Spain but he's coming with me,ep107
36,and my knee to help me with the house,ep107
39,hunt but that doesn't mean she won't try,ep107
42,to take advantage of everything the,ep107
45,region has to offer I'm a little nervous,ep107
48,just for her because she just jumps into,ep107
51,a lot of new situations with really no,ep107
54,regard how far away is it from her,ep107
57,school it's about four to five minutes I,ep107
60,think maybe he doesn't realize that he's,ep107
63,not gonna be here and I don't want to be,ep107
66,bored,ep107
69,[Music],ep107
72,I live in Fontana California I've been,ep107
75,here my entire life there's not like,ep107
78,that much to do apart from like just,ep107
81,playing sports I'm just very nervous,ep107
84,about you going by yourself though I,ep107
87,kind of just wanted to take opportunity,ep107
90,to go abroad and travel and kind of,ep107
93,experience something new so I came,ep107
96,across this program where I can apply to,ep107
99,be a teacher in Spain Elementary they,ep107
102,placed me in a specific village in the,ep107
105,castilla-la mancha region but I know,ep107
108,there's a city nearby of a Sunday that's,ep107
111,more like my life and I know has like,ep107
114,more things to do and keep you busy,ep107
117,Jenna started dating Steven before she,ep107
120,was accepted to the program but she knew,ep107
123,this was an opportunity she couldn't,ep107
126,pass up I really wish I could stay with,ep107
129,you all you're out there I'll definitely,ep107
132,come out there and help you with the,ep107
135,house on so yeah be nice have a another,ep107
138,pair eyes yeah and I'll give you my,ep107
141,opinion for it too yeah not too much,ep107
144,bigger hahaha it's really important to,ep107
147,be able to grow a little bit more and,ep107
150,kind of like learn more about like,ep107
153,different cultures and kind of like more,ep107
156,of an eye-opening experience I wanted to,ep107
159,have a good time and have fun but I,ep107
162,would really just give me the peace of,ep107
165,mind she was in telling this little bit,ep107
168,quieter yes the largely agricultural,ep107
171,castilla-la mancha region is located in,ep107
174,southwestern Spain and is celebrated for,ep107
177,its wine olives and cheese,ep107
180,Jenna it's our new teachers I know,ep107
183,seconds to live in a big city that I,ep107
186,won't hear the closest is 40 minutes,ep107
189,it's just gonna be me and my dog so just,ep107
192,one perfectly 1-bedroom 1-bath I'm would,ep107
195,you mind - Sarah flood with some other,ep107
198,people,ep107
201,I'm prefer to live alone yeah I would,ep107
204,love to have a balcony where I could,ep107
207,have coffee and hang out under my dog,ep107
210,sit out there would be great fully,ep107
213,furnished because I won't have anything,ep107
216,with me air conditioning for summer as,ep107
219,well okay so I have a budget of around,ep107
222,450 would you prefer to find a flat I,ep107
225,kind of wanted something more in the,ep107
228,bigger city so innopolis that they just,ep107
231,cuz I don't want to get bored and I want,ep107
234,to have like many things to do I think,ep107
237,you know if it is going to be more,ep107
240,expensive and then you also have to,ep107
243,taking consideration the commuting if,ep107
246,there's other options as well that are a,ep107
249,little closer that I think everyday they,ep107
252,commute would take a toll on her and,ep107
255,just be so much stressful to add to her,ep107
258,normal work week but I just I do love,ep107
261,the city con she sees she's got her work,ep107
264,cut out for her but she knows Jenna has,ep107
267,her heart set on the city so she starts,ep107
270,the hunt in bustling Alba setting,ep107
273,that's very busy so here's the apartment,ep107
276,it has one bedroom and what are you two,ep107
279,okay and how much it's four hundred and,ep107
282,fifteen dollars per month for new videos,ep107
285,it's the top and how far away is it from,ep107
288,her school it's about 45 minutes by car,ep107
291,it's a little far okay so here we are,ep107
294,okay cute that's been even rolling okay,ep107
297,so it's a nice space looks a little old,ep107
300,little outdated little bit older and all,ep107
303,the furniture comes with the apartment,ep107
306,yes as you can see we have vodka me this,ep107
309,is cute oh it's a nice view yeah it's,ep107
312,pretty,ep107
315,it's a little noisy that's really neat I,ep107
318,like this a lot I love sports sports my,ep107
321,favorite and sing as I can't be back in,ep107
324,California watching like baseball or,ep107
327,basketball I would love to be able to,ep107
330,watch football games here go to the,ep107
333,stadium and see some matches so it'd be,ep107
336,really nice for me ok he has to get to,ep107
339,me,ep107
342,ok it's really small but do you have,ep107
345,everything Junaid I don't know if I like,ep107
348,the washing machine right here gonna get,ep107
351,jumped yeah so do you put afraid outside,ep107
354,maybe yeah is there a dryer or anything,ep107
357,no you have a blow so in here kind of,ep107
360,seems a little far reach to hang the,ep107
363,curtains for me ok so yes the bathroom,ep107
366,ok this is very good size a much yes it,ep107
369,is oh it's not gonna be enough room for,ep107
372,your clothes so what I smell a little,ep107
375,high no you're gonna be reaching all,ep107
378,over the place I definitely can't reach,ep107
381,the top one married bride ooh yes that's,ep107
384,right I didn't if you open your window,ep107
387,and then is there any air conditioning,ep107
390,at all I'm sorry but it doesn't have the,ep107
393,air conditioning is definitely something,ep107
396,that I'm gonna have to think about cuz,ep107
399,that's a tough one during the summer I,ep107
402,know it's gonna get hot and I don't,ep107
405,really want to keep the windows open all,ep107
408,the time so that's gonna be an issue for,ep107
411,sure ok so what did you think,ep107
414,yeah I love the balcony I definitely,ep107
417,spent a lot of time out there I don't,ep107
420,really care so much for it well first,ep107
423,the furniture it's not my favorite it's,ep107
426,a little faded the kitchen is a little,ep107
429,small as well I didn't really care for,ep107
432,the clothesline I'd rather have a dryer,ep107
435,it's a little difficult for me but I,ep107
438,love the city here it's beautiful and I,ep107
441,wouldn't love to live in the city if,ep107
444,Jenny were to do this without me I,ep107
447,definitely think she'd pick something,ep107
450,near the city I would pick something a,ep107
453,little bit closer to work I want her to,ep107
456,just really enjoy it and be happy while,ep107
459,she's here,ep107
462,we are in the center how close is it to,ep107
465,her school experience ten minutes,ep107
468,Stephen feels the practical choice for,ep107
471,Jenna,ep107
474,is a place closer to work and how far is,ep107
477,it from its just 45 minutes it's a,ep107
480,little further than what I want it to be,ep107
483,I know Stephen really wants me to focus,ep107
486,I got words but I would like to have the,ep107
489,life outside of work as well,ep107
492,[Music],ep107
495,this is crazy Jenna's accepted a,ep107
498,teaching position in Spain to experience,ep107
501,something outside of her comfort zone,ep107
504,Fontana kind of locks like the nightlife,ep107
507,before I settle down with like a job and,ep107
510,get like my own house and stuff I kind,ep107
513,of just wanted to take an opportunity to,ep107
516,be able to kind of experience something,ep107
519,that her boyfriend Steven isn't making,ep107
522,the move with him but he feels an,ep107
525,obligation to keep her in check there's,ep107
528,so many people coming up and down this,ep107
531,road all Bessette day is one of the,ep107
534,liveliest cities in the region of,ep107
537,castilla-la mancha well known for its,ep107
540,bustling outdoor markets and lively,ep107
543,night spots so me and Jenna are a little,ep107
546,different just because I'm a little bit,ep107
549,more conservative and she's so outgoing,ep107
552,so do you think about living in closer,ep107
555,to the school at all house one is right,ep107
558,in the center of alba city how far away,ep107
561,is it from her school it's about 45,ep107
564,minutes by car it's a little far,ep107
567,she's moving all the way here to teach,ep107
570,at the school so being closer to the,ep107
573,school should be her main priority,ep107
576,Stephens convinced Jenna's obsession,ep107
579,with the city I like this a lot is,ep107
582,getting in the way of more practical,ep107
585,considerations I didn't really care for,ep107
588,the clothes line I'd rather have a dryer,ep107
591,it's a little difficult for me I know,ep107
594,Stephen really wants me to focus icon,ep107
597,work and like just be like totally for,ep107
600,that but I would like to still be able,ep107
603,to have life outside of work as well,ep107
606,and not just be focused on just work,ep107
609,work work I think the biggest challenge,ep107
612,is to be near school and to pay a lower,ep107
615,price but depends on what she wants,ep107
618,it's hard to find a deal where Jenna,ep107
621,wants to be so it's Stephens advice in,ep107
624,mind Concha tries Tara zona a small town,ep107
627,about 40 minutes north of Alba City,ep107
630,I want to show them a one or diamond,ep107
633,near the school bigger one on the price,ep107
636,will be lower,ep107
639,this is Tottenham we are in the center,ep107
642,it seems a little a little quiet a,ep107
645,little dead now it's job just now but,ep107
648,it's very popular it will be very busy,ep107
651,and how far is it it's just 45 minutes,ep107
654,can you have public transport to go,ep107
657,there it's a little further than what I,ep107
660,wanted to be and how far away is it from,ep107
663,her school,ep107
666,it's sad yes two minutes spiracles this,ep107
669,is apartment it has two bedrooms and two,ep107
672,bathrooms and what's the price the price,ep107
675,is three hundred and fifty dollars per,ep107
678,month okay a lot under budget that's,ep107
681,really nice,ep107
684,so let's have a look I think it's not,ep107
687,exactly what I want it I just don't want,ep107
690,to get bored I want to have options I,ep107
693,want to have things to do this is thin,ep107
696,even room okay this is cute okay two,ep107
699,balconies oh this is nice it's a little,ep107
702,smaller than the other flat you can see,ep107
705,the church from here that's really nice,ep107
708,yeah,ep107
711,anything else there to have coffee um,ep107
714,this is the air conditioner and is it,ep107
717,only on the bottom floor is it awesome,ep107
720,yeah in this car okay she is being,ep107
723,difficult I want her to be really,ep107
726,content with where she's living but then,ep107
729,also I really like that it's close to,ep107
732,the school and then she can not have to,ep107
735,worry too much about the commute I think,ep107
738,as she dives into it a little bit more,ep107
741,she'll have more fun and experience true,ep107
744,authentic Spain he is know was there,ep107
747,okay I like that it's not in the future,ep107
750,yeah oh that's really nice and here's a,ep107
753,kitchen oh my gosh these cabinets are,ep107
756,awful that's really big though yes look,ep107
759,at the color something to get used to I,ep107
762,love green but this yeah this shade is a,ep107
765,little much is there an oven or no no,ep107
768,oven okay it sucks,ep107
771,[Music],ep107
774,this is samasta room okay it's really,ep107
777,big yes again with the green no it's,ep107
780,very consistent I'm not a big fan of how,ep107
783,it slants really not gonna be too much,ep107
786,of a problem for you since you're short,ep107
789,but when I come to visit yes that's,ep107
792,wrong okay good seats too little bit,ep107
795,smaller yes be nice when your sisters,ep107
798,come over and they have an extra room,ep107
801,for them yeah that's true,ep107
804,well it is some really big place I like,ep107
807,it yes a lot of room for you and my need,ep107
810,to run around what do you think a flat,ep107
813,it's nice it's new it's really big yeah,ep107
816,it's a little bigger than what I was,ep107
819,looking for but I love extra space well,ep107
822,I think about it for my sister's come,ep107
825,visit when you come visit be really nice,ep107
828,the price is great it's under budget but,ep107
831,the heating and air-conditioning not on,ep107
834,the second floor could be a bit of a,ep107
837,problem yeah maybe something with,ep107
840,heating and cooling and the entire flat,ep107
843,would be really nice I think I would,ep107
846,still like to see another flat in the,ep107
849,city this,ep107
852,because I just love like the thought of,ep107
855,being central and having a lot of,ep107
858,options of things to do it's just so,ep107
861,small and we first got here and just,ep107
864,seems like it was a ghost town,ep107
867,I know he loves the idea of like me,ep107
870,being near to my work but I still am a,ep107
873,little iffy about beings and there's,ep107
876,such a small place to say a neighborhood,ep107
879,here in all effective here is support of,ep107
882,it it has two bedroom one bathroom and,ep107
885,it has everything that is it far away,ep107
888,from school yes it is Jenna can't resist,ep107
891,the temptation of the city,ep107
894,despite Stephens advice I don't know I,ep107
897,just love the idea of being in the city,ep107
900,we brought wine Jenna is eager to step,ep107
903,outside her comfort zone okay come on,ep107
906,and she's looking for adventure in,ep107
909,southwestern Spain I propose some more,ep107
912,typical food from here in Califano,ep107
915,[Music],ep107
918,Stephen thinks Jenna should focus less,ep107
921,on house ones lively neighborhood a,ep107
924,little noisy I like this and more on how,ep107
927,stews practical upsides I think I like,ep107
930,the village a lot more just because if,ep107
933,you can save 100 bucks here it's also,ep107
936,really close to her school which is,ep107
939,really nice in the community pretty easy,ep107
942,but it seems a little a little quiet,ep107
945,little dead I think I would still like,ep107
948,to see another flat in the city today we,ep107
951,are waiting super fireEye's bunny some,ep107
954,of this okay and just drop it yes be,ep107
957,careful,ep107
960,having Steven here to help me and kind,ep107
963,of have that voice of reason has been,ep107
966,nice but at the same time I think maybe,ep107
969,he doesn't realize that he's not gonna,ep107
972,be here and I don't want to be bored,ep107
975,here's the tortilla,ep107
978,very good so one Appetit so our first,ep107
981,Spanish omelette mm-hmm it's delicious,ep107
984,even like the plan but then is not very,ep107
987,happy with me location country knows,ep107
990,Jenna doesn't want to flat me but living,ep107
993,in a loaf it is going to be more,ep107
996,expensive more than $450 a month so she,ep107
999,heads back to the city and hopes all of,ep107
1002,house threes amenities will make her,ep107
1005,change your mind,ep107
1008,here is support oven it has two bedroom,ep107
1011,one bathroom and it has everything okay,ep107
1014,so air conditioning heating yes and it's,ep107
1017,fully furnished yes okay fine then how,ep107
1020,much is it per month it is $600 per,ep107
1023,month,ep107
1026,Wow little little over my budget but you,ep107
1029,can share with someone else,ep107
1032,yeah that's true if you share then it,ep107
1035,would be cut in half and it only be 300,ep107
1038,then it'd be the cheapest out of all of,ep107
1041,them mm-hmm that's true,ep107
1044,think about okay so okay welcome really,ep107
1047,open yeah that's really a lot of light,ep107
1050,that's lettuce yeah a lot of natural,ep107
1053,lighting mm-hmm the furniture and the TV,ep107
1056,is a little outdated,ep107
1059,but that's the deal with that the same,ep107
1062,conditioner okay perfect,ep107
1065,here's the kitchen okay small but look,ep107
1068,you got your oven yes for H this water,ep107
1071,and then it looks like the washer and,ep107
1074,dryer room over there as well yes okay,ep107
1077,so let's go Zoo wild their homes okay,ep107
1080,it's small it's a full body I always,ep107
1083,loved them you know he really liked Thea,ep107
1086,between mattress but it has a little,ep107
1089,small huh I love it this is the other,ep107
1092,room,ep107
1095,oh wow this one's a lot bigger I like,ep107
1098,the size I said make me wrong but I,ep107
1101,guess if I did share the fun I have to,ep107
1104,see who would gather what room yeah how,ep107
1107,would you decide,ep107
1110,I'd prefer this room yeah I still think,ep107
1113,Jenna's more into this place just,ep107
1116,because it is in the city,ep107
1119,I still want Jenna to have fun out here,ep107
1122,and really experience the Spanish,ep107
1125,culture but I also wanted her to focus,ep107
1128,on her job and what she came here for -,ep107
1131,oh yes it's really nice it is bigger,ep107
1134,than what I thought I guess yeah,ep107
1137,probably fit a table out here yes you,ep107
1140,can fit a table here yeah it looks like,ep107
1143,the nightlife would get pretty big too,ep107
1146,here there's a lot of people help right,ep107
1149,now yeah what do you think about the,ep107
1152,flats overall it's nice it's a nice,ep107
1155,space it's big seems a little,ep107
1158,old-fashioned yeah a little outdated,ep107
1161,with the furniture and the colors and,ep107
1164,everything I just don't know if I like,ep107
1167,the idea of having apartment then also,ep107
1170,that commute to work is gonna be pretty,ep107
1173,intense I don't know I just love the,ep107
1176,idea of being in the city just the toll,ep107
1179,of taking 45 minutes every day to go to,ep107
1182,and from work even though it doesn't,ep107
1185,sound like much now and you're a couple,ep107
1188,weeks and it's gonna be tough,ep107
1191,Jenna came to Spain to live life to the,ep107
1194,fullest Steven wants to give her a,ep107
1197,reality check,ep107
1200,I know you wanted to be in the city but,ep107
1203,my personal opinion I think it'd be nice,ep107
1206,to shoot under budget a little bit and,ep107
1209,then also be really close to your work,ep107
1212,as well it's just a little quiet,ep107
1215,Jenna is in Spain to experience,ep107
1218,something different than the suburban,ep107
1221,life she's known yeah I know you were,ep107
1224,lugging really close to the nightlife,ep107
1227,and everything she's eager to check out,ep107
1230,city life but her now long-distance,ep107
1233,boyfriend Stephen thinks she needs to,ep107
1236,focus on what makes the most sense I,ep107
1239,think every day the commute would take a,ep107
1242,toll on her what do you think of the big,ep107
1245,balcony fun house 1 is in Alba 2nd,ep107
1248,that's really I like this a lot,ep107
1251,I know you would love that and then,ep107
1254,being really close to the nightlife and,ep107
1257,everything would be a bus but it also,ep107
1260,was a really long commute to work every,ep107
1263,day yeah so that's nice I can told I,ep107
1266,knew you liked the village I know you,ep107
1269,like melody but she's worried about,ep107
1272,feeling isolated by village life it,ep107
1275,seems a little a little quiet a little,ep107
1278,dead it just seemed like it was a ghost,ep107
1281,town well what did you think about the,ep107
1284,shared flood what's really nice is in,ep107
1287,the city center I can see the nightlife,ep107
1290,all around but in order to make it,ep107
1293,budget-friendly she'd have to get a,ep107
1296,roommate I don't know if I'm a huge fan,ep107
1299,of that then also that commute to work,ep107
1302,is gonna be pretty intense,ep107
1305,[Music],ep107
1308,do you feel like you could cross any of,ep107
1311,them off your list right now it would,ep107
1314,probably be the shared yeah I agree,ep107
1317,it had all the amenities I was looking,ep107
1320,for but I just don't like the idea of,ep107
1323,having to live with somebody and then,ep107
1326,have to worry about if I leave my knee,ep107
1329,there if it's a problem for them and,ep107
1332,then for when you guys come visit yeah,ep107
1335,it's just a little an inconvenience okay,ep107
1338,so we have two choices yeah so are you,ep107
1341,leaning towards any one in particular,ep107
1344,right now big balcony well I was right,ep107
1347,in the city center and I really loved,ep107
1350,the views from the balcony and the fact,ep107
1353,that I can walk to the city and watch,ep107
1356,games and it had a lot of the amenities,ep107
1359,we were looking for,ep107
1362,I know you wanted to be in this city but,ep107
1365,my personal opinion I think it'd be nice,ep107
1368,to shoot under budget a little bit and,ep107
1371,then also be really close to your work,ep107
1374,as well it'd be perfect,ep107
1377,yeah but then that just means it's 40,ep107
1380,minutes from other side there yeah but,ep107
1383,it's always available and you can always,ep107
1386,catch a ride whenever you need to to get,ep107
1389,to the city yeah that's true and the,ep107
1392,village did seem like it had a lot to,ep107
1395,offer,ep107
1398,I mean surprisingly I didn't think it,ep107
1401,would have so many restaurants and cafes,ep107
1404,yeah I was still a really lively village,ep107
1407,for being so small and then the,ep107
1410,apartment with the big balcony even the,ep107
1413,kitchen was really tiny there was really,ep107
1416,no wiggle room for you or my knee or,ep107
1419,even if I come and your sisters come to,ep107
1422,there's not gonna be really much room at,ep107
1425,all and that closed hangar was not the,ep107
1428,business yeah I was almost dangerous out,ep107
1431,there like I think it would be totally,ep107
1434,useless to me yeah honestly as much as I,ep107
1437,didn't really want to live away from the,ep107
1440,city I really loved the price of the,ep107
1443,village lot and I love the authentic,ep107
1446,Spanish feel that you get there it was,ep107
1449,really nice and even though I hate or,ep107
1452,the green cabinets I think it could be a,ep107
1455,trade-off so that I could look over so,ep107
1458,did we have a decision you think I think,ep107
1461,so I I think I'm gonna go with the,ep107
1464,village,ep107
1467,[Music],ep107
1470,living in taka sona because it's so,ep107
1473,small and it's far from the big cities,ep107
1476,you get the real Spanish life living,ep107
1479,here the things I like most about this,ep107
1482,apartment it's probably the balconies I,ep107
1485,love being able to go out on the balcony,ep107
1488,and drink my morning coffee or have a,ep107
1491,glass of wine and read okay so let's go,ep107
1494,over some vocabulary guys my job is,ep107
1497,going really well I'm really enjoying it,ep107
1500,the students are great okay Steven,ep107
1503,spelling I'm visiting me soon it's been,ep107
1506,difficult being long distance but we,ep107
1509,talked to each other all the time I miss,ep107
1512,you too babe it's like moving here to,ep107
1515,Spain has made me a lot more independent,ep107
1518,I've met a lot of friends here and I,ep107
1521,feel like it's definitely helped me have,ep107
1524,a different view on everything,ep107
12,I love this kitchen it's perfect,ep108
15,these recent transplants from Georgia,ep108
18,want to buy a home close to the beach in,ep108
21,Naples Florida the screams actually come,ep108
24,down inside tucked in here man I could,ep108
27,totally see us staying out here all the,ep108
30,time problem is Lisa wants to put her,ep108
33,personal stamp on every home she sees,ep108
36,well I guess you could push that wall,ep108
39,back you just would have to redo the,ep108
42,vanities why are you changing stuff ed,ep108
45,is holding out for a move-in-ready home,ep108
48,with high-end details yeah like your,ep108
51,Brown cabinets that's what I want,ep108
54,we have to paint this and put a new,ep108
57,granite or something why and with nearly,ep108
60,2 million dollars on the line who will,ep108
63,get the final say we have to put a,ep108
66,screened-in cage out here at why now yes,ep108
69,if we knock this wall down then move the,ep108
72,back there Nicole is the knock down,ep108
75,house,ep108
78,[Music],ep108
81,it's actually one of the best-selling,ep108
84,Jets out on the market today I'm Lisa,ep108
87,and I'm the private aviation consultant,ep108
90,there you go and I'm ed I'm the CFO for,ep108
93,a large golf and residential community,ep108
96,and we live in Naples Florida we've been,ep108
99,married for eight wonderful years mine,ep108
102,actually coming up on nine we met at a,ep108
105,cocktail party and we got married two,ep108
108,years later coming to you,ep108
111,good shot we've got a six year old,ep108
114,little boy Eamonn when we lived in,ep108
117,Atlanta Edie came room and told me that,ep108
120,he wanted to interview for a job in,ep108
123,Naples and I said that's not gonna,ep108
126,happen,ep108
129,but then he brought me down here and we,ep108
132,were wined and dined and seduced by,ep108
135,Paradise I love this area maybe we,ep108
138,should get a boat was a great thing,ep108
141,about Naples is it's still a smaller,ep108
144,town the crime is basically non-existent,ep108
147,and there's the beach which I've always,ep108
150,wanted to live at the beach and so it,ep108
153,said that house is really nice I love,ep108
156,that house,ep108
159,we've been in Naples only a few months,ep108
162,and part of the reason we have to buy,ep108
165,houses I'm a nester and I feel so out of,ep108
168,sorts living in a rental home so they,ep108
171,want to buy and are looking for a,ep108
174,spacious four-bedroom three-bath home,ep108
177,but location is key for Lisa we both had,ep108
180,a fantasy about living at the beach so,ep108
183,it's really important for me to be a,ep108
186,block away from the beach I'm not sure,ep108
189,about one block to the beach but you,ep108
192,know close to the beach is okay you can,ep108
195,ride your bike helping ed and Lise on,ep108
198,their searches local real estate broker,ep108
201,Heather King who also has a background,ep108
204,in design to be close to the beach here,ep108
207,Naples the prices are high what's your,ep108
210,budget,ep108
213,well we're 1.7 million you're gonna have,ep108
216,to probably entertain a fixer-upper if,ep108
219,you want to walk to the beach I'm really,ep108
222,excited about fixing something up we did,ep108
225,a fabulous job in our house in Atlanta,ep108
228,so I do want a project I feel like it,ep108
231,gives me a creative palette to express,ep108
234,myself I love Lisa for her energy her,ep108
237,excitement,ep108
240,she's the grasshopper of the family,ep108
243,she's bouncing around from thing to,ep108
246,thing I'm the aunt I marched a long slow,ep108
249,and steady I keep the budget I really,ep108
252,have a move-in-ready house I don't,ep108
255,really have the desire to have another,ep108
258,project so what style are you guys,ep108
261,looking for in your home I can tell you,ep108
264,what we don't like we really don't like,ep108
267,the Mediterranean style and that's,ep108
270,what's mostly down here we've kind of,ep108
273,noticed that style of the house that I,ep108
276,would like to find is something that's a,ep108
279,Craftsman style architecture I would,ep108
282,like to find a ranch-style home now are,ep108
285,you open to a single-story I want to,ep108
288,have a two-story house I grew up in a,ep108
291,little house with the big family and,ep108
294,dogs and cats and everything running,ep108
297,around so I need my space,ep108
300,I'd prefer one-story so he can't get,ep108
303,away from me one thing they can agree on,ep108
306,is an open kitchen with plenty of,ep108
309,entertaining space but Edie likes warm,ep108
312,dark woods while Lisa wants it to be,ep108
315,light and bright it's very important to,ep108
318,me that the kitchen is pretty do you,ep108
321,know where the kitchen is I can make a,ep108
324,great salad,ep108
327,do you want to yard along with a pool,ep108
330,big yard and I definitely want a pool,ep108
333,that's enclosed,ep108
336,why do you need to have a screen there's,ep108
339,too many bubbles I'm really excited,ep108
342,about the possibility of having a beach,ep108
345,house because we literally wrote it down,ep108
348,in our goals as a family so it's really,ep108
351,a dream come true,ep108
354,first up a Craftsman style home for,ep108
357,Eadie,ep108
360,wow it's big it is it's two-story that's,ep108
363,cool I love that and the architecture is,ep108
366,kind of cool different yep it's,ep108
369,definitely not Mediterranean that's for,ep108
372,sure,ep108
375,although I don't like a Mediterranean,ep108
378,style I don't know what this style is,ep108
381,but this is definitely not my style,ep108
384,either a little nervous about the stairs,ep108
387,what's wrong with the stairs no I don't,ep108
390,want a man to fall down at or something,ep108
393,don't worry too much,ep108
396,the asking price is 1 million five,ep108
399,hundred ninety five thousand the house,ep108
402,is about four thousand square feet it's,ep108
405,a 4-bedroom 5-bath home five baths does,ep108
408,it also has a pool and you're gonna love,ep108
411,this Lisa there's a screened-in lanai,ep108
414,and really only 1.7 miles from the beach,ep108
417,when you could wait 1.7 miles movie we,ep108
420,wanted to be a block from there that's,ep108
423,not really walking distance I need to be,ep108
426,able to walk to the beach in the morning,ep108
429,to me 1.7 miles,ep108
432,you might as well be 20 miles the,ep108
435,kitchen I think you're really gonna like,ep108
438,because it is a great entertainer dream,ep108
441,in here hey I like the Brown cabinets,ep108
444,that's what I want that looks good I,ep108
447,want white cabinets we don't have to,ep108
450,touch this we can leave it exactly the,ep108
453,way it is we have to paint this and put,ep108
456,a new granite or something why if you,ep108
459,want me to make a salad I'm gonna need,ep108
462,white kitchen,ep108
465,Heather how much would it cost because,ep108
468,we'd have to change out the entire,ep108
471,kitchen I think to be safe in here about,ep108
474,"$20,000 $20,000 that's not bad for a",ep108
477,whole new kitchen I love the size I love,ep108
480,the color I love everything don't touch,ep108
483,it your breakfast nook is here and then,ep108

534,great I don't know I mean the cage makes,ep108

576,totally baffles me that my husband can,ep108
579,see that says move-in ready but I see at,ep108
582,"least 350,000 dollars right off the bat",ep108
585,that I would have to do to this home to,ep108
588,make it feel comfortable for me she,ep108
591,wants to put her touches on it we're,ep108
594,gonna have to redo a lot of stuff that,ep108

600,broken don't fix it,ep108
603,to get upstairs they take a short ride,ep108

612,upstairs I love that about a lot and I,ep108
615,mean look at the ceiling detail and all,ep108
618,the other details is nice yeah kai,ep108
621,reminds me like of a church yeah they,ep108
624,take a look at two more guest bedrooms,ep108
627,with ensuite bathrooms so paint new,ep108
630,floor Kojo budget budget I love how big,ep108
633,the rooms are and how much space this,ep108
636,place has what are you thinking up the,ep108
639,home like that well I love the,ep108
642,screened-in area and the pool of course,ep108
645,because we'll be able to socialize and,ep108
648,have big parties and stuff out there,ep108
651,really like that kitchen the Brown,ep108
654,cabinets I love that dark Alice well I,ep108
657,don't love the dark cabinets and it's,ep108
660,not really walking distance to the beach,ep108
663,that's true if you want to be that close,ep108
666,to the beach and you want to stay in,ep108
669,budget there's got to be a little bit of,ep108
672,compromise one of our must-haves is to,ep108
675,be close to the beach so I think we,ep108
678,should just keep looking and see if we,ep108
681,can find something at and I both want,ep108
684,with location a priority Heather finds,ep108
687,the ideal spot with an even better price,ep108
690,but there's a catch the HGTV app,ep108
693,we have to make sure that we get a house,ep108
696,really close to the beach to live within,ep108
699,walking distance of the sandy shores of,ep108
702,Naples Florida,ep108
705,Lisa's willing to take on a fixer-upper,ep108
708,and get the most out of their 1.7,ep108
711,million dollar budget husband Ed would,ep108
714,rather have a house that doesn't need,ep108
717,any work so far they've seen a,ep108
720,contemporary Florida craftsman that's,ep108
723,move-in ready for ED but is farther from,ep108
726,the beach than Lisa would like since,ep108
729,location was a concern for Lisa their,ep108
732,agent has lined up a house for her you,ep108
735,can walk to the beach you can take your,ep108
738,golf cart to the beach,ep108
741,don't force the beach a quarter of a,ep108
744,mile you could ride your bike there -,ep108
747,absolutely it's priced at a million 99,ep108
750,it's that Mediterranean style we didn't,ep108
753,lose everything down here like that to,ep108
756,be in your price range and to be close,ep108
759,to the beach,ep108
762,I mean Mediterranean you know that,ep108
765,ranch-style home is kind of where we're,ep108
768,gonna be I like the ranch the color of,ep108
771,the house is really ugly what's the,ep108
774,inside look like the inside is it has,ep108
777,not been updated but it has not so it is,ep108
780,definitely Lisa's fixer-upper,ep108
783,I know the expression on your face add,ep108
786,but let me tell you this is a blank,ep108
789,canvas we can see there's a good price,ep108
792,if we can then use our extra budget,ep108
795,money and do everything we want honey I,ep108
798,know she has the passion for it I just,ep108
801,don't know if we're up to taking on the,ep108
804,challenge of redoing a house like this,ep108
807,all right so this is your family room,ep108
810,dining room area Wow,ep108
813,it looks old is this normal it is a,ep108
816,little low but and the great thing about,ep108
819,a lot of these homes is that you can,ep108
822,raise the ceiling how much is that gonna,ep108
825,"cost it can be anywhere from $10,000 all",ep108
828,"the way up to $50,000 $50,000 I just",ep108
831,think about this if you raise the,ep108
834,ceiling in here and put some shiplap and,ep108
837,some pretty beams in here when you walk,ep108
840,in it would really be eye-catching and,ep108
843,then it would go straight out to this,ep108
846,gorgeous view of the pool I love the,ep108
849,idea of putting our own footprint on,ep108
852,something it sounds like a lot of money,ep108
855,to me so I think the kitchen ocher so,ep108
858,Emma's kitchen,ep108
861,I mean you can really create whatever,ep108
864,you want as far as a dream kitchen well,ep108
867,we would have to yeah its mines me the,ep108
870,old diners in New York yeah we have to,ep108
873,demo everything we'd have to demo know,ep108
876,what they crate thing though is I,ep108
879,already see a vision for this kitchen,ep108
882,they're just a vision are your dollars,ep108
885,so I got kitchens I got ceilings this is,ep108
888,not moving ready oh it's not but you,ep108
891,know we did a great job renovating in,ep108
894,Atlanta we could do something like that,ep108
897,here I'm starting to see it we have a,ep108
900,budget Lisa we've only gotten through,ep108
903,two rooms well that's true they look at,ep108
906,a bedroom and bathroom oh my oh wow,ep108
909,this tree and some help before going,ep108
912,outside to see the pool area now your,ep108
915,area isn't it gorgeous is pretty bit a,ep108
918,couple of lounge chairs we're good to go,ep108
921,I love it I don't have to touch it we,ep108
924,don't do it well we have to put a,ep108
927,screened-in cage out here add why,ep108
930,mosquitoes cost us anywhere from 15 to,ep108
933,"$25,000 $25,000 not bad that's worth it",ep108
936,another great feature about this area is,ep108
939,the master the bedroom actually connects,ep108
942,right here it's nice right I love that,ep108
945,it is small well I guess you could push,ep108
948,that wall back this isn't a fixer-upper,ep108
951,this is a knocker downer I feel sort of,ep108
954,bad when I see Ed's face walking around,ep108
957,the house because he's a CPA and I know,ep108
960,that he's adding up dollar signs in,ep108
963,every realm going to change ching ching,ep108
966,but the thing i love about this house is,ep108
969,it's really a blank canvas so I think,ep108
972,there's a lot of potential here I need,ep108
975,two really big closet so let's check out,ep108
978,oh that is uh not big this isn't gonna,ep108
981,work well you know yes if we knock this,ep108
984,wall down and move the back there ah,ep108
987,get down knock knock down house the list,ep108
990,of upgrades for this house is about as,ep108
993,long as my arm and my leg put together,ep108
996,we're gonna blow through our budget very,ep108
999,quickly they see two more guest bedrooms,ep108
1002,and a second guest bath look at this,ep108
1005,counter that's crazy,ep108
1008,I think they call these retro,ep108
1011,it's really close to the beach and,ep108
1014,that's one of the things we wanted the,ep108
1017,most this place is gonna take a lot of,ep108
1020,work you want to put in a pool cage some,ep108
1023,kitchen the master bathroom,ep108
1026,don't forget the ceilings it's not,ep108
1029,moving ready Lisa I really want to move,ep108
1032,in ready well I really wanted a project,ep108
1035,so well you've got your project to me,ep108
1038,this is the perfect fixer-upper even,ep108
1041,though I know it's exactly the opposite,ep108
1044,of what EDD wants but I can see the,ep108
1047,vision here he's just gonna take a,ep108
1050,little convincing it sounds to me like,ep108
1053,we're gonna have to do an awful lot just,ep108
1056,to be this close to the beach,ep108
1059,seeking a compromise between their,ep108
1062,different styles,ep108
1065,Heather pulls out all the stops on an,ep108
1068,amenity Phil,ep108
1071,[Music],ep108
1074,Wow so beautiful another great day at,ep108
1077,the beach huh yeah,ep108
1080,with a budget of 1.7 million ed and Lisa,ep108
1083,are searching Naples Florida for a house,ep108
1086,as close to the beach as possible but,ep108
1089,they're having trouble agreeing on the,ep108
1092,type of house they should buy so far,ep108
1095,they've seen a two-story craftsman,ep108
1098,perfect for ED and a Mediterranean ranch,ep108
1101,for Lisa that needed a complete,ep108
1104,renovation but was within walking,ep108
1107,distance of the beach hoping to please,ep108
1110,ed and Lisa their broker has lined up a,ep108
1113,single-story farmhouse that's been fully,ep108
1116,upgraded the house is listed at 1,ep108
1119,million seven hundred and twenty-five,ep108
1122,thousand exactly so on it looks adorable,ep108
1125,but how far away are we from the beach,ep108
1128,you know we are quite a bit away from,ep108
1131,the beach but the nice thing about this,ep108
1134,home is there's actually a shuttle that,ep108
1137,runs you to the beach where you get,ep108
1140,umbrella,ep108
1143,oh this home is amazing it's beautiful,ep108
1146,but it's pretty far from the beach,ep108
1149,I like the move-in-ready part yeah,ep108
1152,absolutely it's a 4-bedroom 5-bath,ep108
1155,it is stunning on the inside it's not,ep108
1158,two stories I was kind of hoping for two,ep108
1161,stories but it still offers you the,ep108
1164,bedroom bathroom count that you really,ep108
1167,want it let's check it out Wow good you,ep108
1170,got your white kitchen Lea I love this,ep108

1182,cold I want it warm feeling why would,ep108
1185,you change this it's perfect cuz it,ep108
1188,doesn't it just feels cold Lea so if we,ep108
1191,got people in here you know you want a,ep108
1194,warm cozy feeling and this doesn't feel,ep108
1197,cozy to me well I know it might not feel,ep108
1200,cozy to you but the view from this,ep108
1203,island it's stunning that is a nice view,ep108
1206,out those windows I'll give you that and,ep108
1209,then the great thing are these sliders,ep108
1212,go invisible so they tuck all the way,ep108
1215,back through here so this way you have a,ep108
1218,huge,ep108
1221,Neal Oh outside and if you look these go,ep108
1224,all the way back in on either side and,ep108
1227,then you have this enormous I just,ep108
1230,noticed they don't have a screened-in no,ep108
1233,they do let the screens actually come,ep108
1236,down inside tucked in here oh wow and I,ep108
1239,could totally see us staying out here,ep108
1242,all the time,ep108
1245,yeah they got outdoor kitchens amazing,ep108
1248,we got a couple of burgers on a grill a,ep108
1251,couple of beers we're awesome this is,ep108
1254,good to go,ep108
1257,I really like the screened-in cage on,ep108
1260,the outside because what are you gonna,ep108
1263,do open it up and down when the kids are,ep108
1266,running this cat screams you said you,ep108
1269,wanted screams I do honey but I want,ep108
1272,them out so we can have the kids be,ep108
1275,covered too so we'll just add that not a,ep108
1278,big deal just add that sure sure,ep108
1281,back inside they check out the master,ep108
1284,suite wow this is beautiful I like the,ep108
1287,big open space I love the color,ep108
1290,yeah it's beautiful look at this closet,ep108
1293,come on through here oh wow this is,ep108
1296,awesome oh that's a big closet look at,ep108
1299,this Lisa oh wow this is beautiful oh I,ep108
1302,can see your stuff all over there oh,ep108
1305,there's plenty of room in the drawers,ep108
1308,that's great,ep108
1311,from there they see a guest bath and two,ep108
1314,more bedrooms this is really nice,ep108
1317,I could make this a nice office before,ep108
1320,seeing another bedroom that could be for,ep108
1323,their son oh this is really cute for him,ep108
1326,I love this we'd have to paint it you,ep108
1329,know more boyish color bathroom it's,ep108
1332,horrible and it's got a tub which I,ep108
1335,thought would be great for him as well,ep108
1338,tub and shower yeah I like it,ep108
1341,I think this house is really kind of,ep108
1344,perfect I like the big open ceilings,ep108
1347,I like the newness I like that it's,ep108
1350,move-in ready I love most of the paint,ep108
1353,colors and then we'd only have to paint,ep108
1356,a couple rooms yeah the kitchen is,ep108
1359,beautiful but it's so if the colors are,ep108
1362,just so cold it is perfect feels like a,ep108
1365,hospital if we could take this house and,ep108
1368,move it to the beach we would be done,ep108
1371,right you know we'd have to add about a,ep108
1374,million to that price tag if we if we,ep108
1377,moved it to the beach with none of the,ep108
1380,homes meeting all of their needs they'll,ep108
1383,have to decide if sticking to their,ep108
1386,budget taking on projects or being close,ep108
1389,to the beach will win out one confident,ep108
1392,we could make it really,ep108
1395,ed and Lisa want to fulfill their dream,ep108
1398,of buying a home in the beach community,ep108
1401,of Naples Florida they've looked at,ep108
1404,several homes in their 1.7 million,ep108
1407,dollar price range and are meeting with,ep108
1410,their broker Heather to decide which is,ep108
1413,right for them listed at one point five,ep108
1416,nine million their first option is a,ep108
1419,two-story craftsman it checked all the,ep108
1422,boxes for sure was move-in ready,ep108
1425,it had the caged pool I do love them,ep108
1428,on.i but the brown get you would have to,ep108
1431,go that kitchen is perfect,ep108
1434,don't touch that kitchen the one thing,ep108
1437,it was a little far from the beach,ep108
1440,it's only a mile and a half you could,ep108
1443,technically ride your bike or take your,ep108
1446,golf cart to the beach I know it just,ep108
1449,feels like if you're gonna live in,ep108
1452,Manhattan live in Manhattan don't live,ep108
1455,in Brooklyn let's talk about the,ep108
1458,fixer-upper listed at a million,ep108
1461,ninety-nine I like the price and I like,ep108
1464,the fact that it's close to the beach,ep108
1467,I'm not wild about the fixer-upper part,ep108
1470,the biggest thing to me about that house,ep108
1473,is that it's a blank slate you can make,ep108
1476,it into anything but it's in the exactly,ep108
1479,perfect location it definitely is a,ep108
1482,blank slate because we have to I mean,ep108
1485,we'd almost have to gut it I mean come,ep108
1488,on that kitchen was so old the rooms the,ep108
1491,ceilings I mean I could touch the,ep108
1494,ceilings,ep108
1497,I guess the compromise then really is,ep108
1500,the Florida farmhouse set 1 million,ep108
1503,seven hundred twenty-five thousand that,ep108
1506,house is beautiful I love the kitchen I,ep108
1509,love everything about the way it's,ep108
1512,decorated we would have to put in a,ep108
1515,spendin lanai outside yeah in that,ep108
1518,kitchen we'd have to do something with,ep108
1521,that kitchen because it just felt so,ep108
1524,cold to me while we could do don't,ep108
1527,change the floors yeah no we wouldn't,ep108
1530,change and don't forget that house it,ep108
1533,wasn't at the high end of the budget,ep108
1536,it's it is out of the budget,ep108
1539,when Ed and I moved here for his job we,ep108
1542,said one thing that we're going to make,ep108
1545,sure that we do is we want to live at,ep108
1548,the beach though we're going with the,ep108
1551,fixer-upper at the beach great it's,ep108
1554,gonna take a lot of work to make that,ep108
1557,house what we want it to be but at least,ep108
1560,it gave up a lot to come down here for,ep108
1563,my job I wanted to be able to give her,ep108
1566,what she wanted so the beach house it is,ep108
1569,this needs to come out also yeah take,ep108
1572,this out and then we'll have the vault,ep108
1575,in here when we bought the house it was,ep108
1578,so exciting because it was always a,ep108
1581,dream of mine to have a house at the,ep108
1584,beach so when I turned the key and I,ep108
1587,realized the vision of what I could do,ep108
1590,with the home I just got really excited,ep108
1593,and I got to admit when I turned the kid,ep108
1596,walked in the door I kind of said what,ep108
1599,have we done can you take the threshold,ep108
1602,or you know you could I'm really excited,ep108
1605,about working with Heather Kane because,ep108
1608,I can start to see the vision that we,ep108
1611,have for our home and if you remove this,ep108
1614,front with all of the arches right here,ep108
1617,I feel like it will really take away,ep108
1620,some of that Mediterranean look the,ep108
1623,exterior style of the house is not,ep108
1626,exactly what either ELISA or I wanted,ep108
1629,however we've talked with our builder,ep108
1632,and we have some ideas baby put up some,ep108
1635,shutters definitely change some of the,ep108
1638,colors so we can really change the way,ep108
1641,the front of the house looks this wall,ep108
1644,is coming down that well this wall will,ep108
1647,also come down we had this opened up so,ep108
1650,you can see how expansive it'll be it's,ep108
1653,really exciting the floor plan that the,ep108
1656,Builder did because I get to knock down,ep108
1659,walls I get to raise the ceiling I get,ep108
1662,to build new rooms and the best thing is,ep108
1665,we get to walk to the beach take our,ep108
1668,bikes to the beach take our golf cart to,ep108
1671,the beach so it's all about the beach,ep108
12,oh my god Matt and Kendra are searching,ep109
15,for their first home in Liberty Missouri,ep109
18,they need lots of space for their three,ep109
21,girls dog t-rex and the chickens Kendra,ep109
24,wants to raise Kendra wants a historic,ep109
27,home because it tells the story Matt on,ep109
30,the other hand wants a new build I,ep109
33,really like to see things when I was,ep109
36,kind of drawn up to them can he lured,ep109
39,her into the 21st century with modern,ep109
42,amenities how I couldn't see right here,ep109
45,behind you is the master closet,ep109
48,[Music],ep109
51,I am Kendra I am a freelance writer and,ep109
54,I stay home with my girls this is my,ep109
57,husband Matt he's a project manager for,ep109
60,a motorcycle company we have two old,ep109
63,twin daughters one is Audrey in the,ep109
66,other ones Amelia and we also have an,ep109
69,eight-month-old named Kennedy and a,ep109
72,golden doodle named t-rex that's a,ep109
75,perfect girl dad he is so sweet with,ep109
78,them and dances with them but then,ep109
81,Russell Finley so they're gonna be tough,ep109
84,they currently ranch a two-bedroom,ep109
87,townhouse that's getting a little,ep109
90,cramped for themselves the kids and,ep109
93,possibly more kids to come Matt and I am,ep109
96,team licensed foster parents a year ago,ep109
99,after our first placement we decided,ep109
102,that's what we want to do we want to,ep109
105,adopt out of foster care and that's why,ep109
108,we need a bigger house you like it you,ep109
111,like we love living in Kansas City in,ep109
114,Missouri as opposed to Kansas City,ep109
117,Kansas there is a big difference and if,ep109
120,you are from here you know that there's,ep109
123,kind of a rivalry there looking on the,ep109
126,Missouri side just outside the city in,ep109
129,Matt's hometown of Liberty,ep109
132,I remember Liberty when it was just a,ep109
135,small town it was almost like you were,ep109
138,in the country but you're also just,ep109
141,close enough to see that you can go,ep109
144,there for the day if you'd like to enjoy,ep109
147,the city life we really like the area of,ep109
150,around the square of Liberty has a lot,ep109
153,of shops really yummy restaurants that,ep109
156,are locally owned and there's a lot of,ep109
159,historic homes I'm talking over a,ep109
162,hundred years old if we get a house,ep109
165,close to here after the girls feel,ep109
168,asleep I can walk here and have more,ep109
171,"coffee our max budget is 230,000 if we",ep109
174,could stay below it that would be great,ep109
177,if we get a newer build like he wants we,ep109
180,might not be able to I want a new build,ep109
183,craftsman because with a house that's,ep109
186,updated from like the 1900s as opposed,ep109
189,to a newer build just don't really know,ep109
192,what could be going on behind the walls,ep109
195,what do you,ep109
198,okay an old home Kendra also likes the,ep109
201,Craftsman style but she prefers one,ep109
204,that's original,ep109
207,I love homes that have a history and,ep109
210,that have stories behind them it's been,ep109
213,there for a hundred years,ep109
216,I would love to have two levels because,ep109
219,I work nights if the kids are downstairs,ep109
222,playing then it'll allow me to sleep you,ep109
225,know without interruption during the day,ep109
228,Kendra would prefer a single story I,ep109
231,don't want to do stairs up and down all,ep109
234,day long but there are things that they,ep109
237,agree on they both want at least four,ep109
240,bedrooms and two full baths for their,ep109
243,expanding family the privacy that comes,ep109
246,with a master bathroom is so important,ep109
249,to me and that's like me time my dream,ep109
252,is a clawfoot tub and if I cannot have a,ep109
255,clawfoot tub then I want a big tub with,ep109
258,jets I love white and grays I won't wait,ep109
261,everything including a large white,ep109
264,kitchen they both also want a garage to,ep109
267,deal with Missouri winters and a porch,ep109
270,for enjoying summers I grew up at a,ep109
273,house that had a really big green yard,ep109
276,and so that's something I'd really like,ep109
279,to see my kids have you know what that,ep109
282,means,ep109
285,I don't exactly yes I can finally have,ep109
288,chickens if they never big enough yard,ep109
291,you say chickens but I hear chores I,ep109
294,know but it's good chores,ep109
297,I have names cook down everything so I,ep109
300,do too fried chicken baked chicken,ep109
303,chicken first up an older home in,ep109
306,Liberty Square it's definitely the,ep109
309,Craftsman style so here I've got for you,ep109
312,guys this great craftsman built in 1900,ep109
315,Norma's about the age yes it is older,ep109
318,but it's been well maintained that I,ep109
321,think that even you might like it okay,ep109
324,Kendra and Matt want a lot of space,ep109
327,because they want to have a big family,ep109
330,that's kind of where the mutual likes in,ep109
333,four bedrooms one and a half baths only,ep109
336,one bathroom for five people but you've,ep109
339,got to see the one and a half baths and,ep109
342,it's priced at 180 thousand so really,ep109
345,good yeah and look at that porch babe,ep109
348,I like the story this is a really pretty,ep109
351,entryway I was not expecting a big,ep109
354,entryway off the entry is the living,ep109
357,room I wish this were a real fireplace,ep109
360,are these original oh yes they're of,ep109
363,course very worn and yeah you know we,ep109
366,can refinish them one day but I like,ep109
369,that your scratches because it tells the,ep109
372,story are these pocket doors yes they,ep109
375,are fully functioning yes it's what you,ep109
378,get with an older home you're not gonna,ep109
381,find this in a new business right,ep109
384,I know Kendra's gonna call the cracks in,ep109
387,the walls and the stains on the floor,ep109
390,character but to me I see costs and I,ep109
393,didn't know that those are gonna add up,ep109
396,later,ep109
399,that is pretty stubborn but I can be,ep109
402,just as stubborn we'll see where that,ep109
405,leads us with this house hunt yeah over,ep109
408,there oh another door or does that goes,ep109
411,out to the side,ep109
414,mm-hmm so there is a driveway right here,ep109
417,there is and so there's plenty of,ep109
420,parking that's ours no garage,ep109
423,there is no garage they see the half,ep109
426,bath which also doubles as the laundry,ep109
429,room it is just a half bath bet you,ep109
432,could easily make it at least a 3/4 bath,ep109
435,by putting a shower in the corner we,ep109
438,have two bathrooms with two baths right,ep109
441,Oh,ep109
444,and so we're almost losing something,ep109
447,moving into this house they see the,ep109
450,dining room on the way to the kitchen,ep109
453,this is a really good-size much more,ep109
456,updated than I thought it was gonna be,ep109
459,for an older home I was actually,ep109
462,expecting it to be falling apart I do,ep109
465,like the white cabinets,ep109
468,I wish the countertops were white what,ep109
471,is this room that is actually like a,ep109
474,walk-in pantry it was a refrigerator,ep109
477,the refrigerators in another room though,ep109
480,I actually don't mind they head out to,ep109
483,the backyard,ep109
486,oh wow really big there's definitely,ep109
489,enough space for garage the place that,ep109
492,stays oh that is a really nice yeah it's,ep109
495,very fenced guess what this is gonna be,ep109
498,your chicken coop they go back inside to,ep109
501,the second floor to see three bedrooms,ep109
504,looks like it's already painted for the,ep109
507,girls I like it you know like you know,ep109
510,me I just like white then they check out,ep109
513,the bathroom on this floor oh I,ep109
516,definitely wish that there was at least,ep109
519,another bathroom you know that was kind,ep109
522,of a deal breaker for us this is a,ep109
525,really good size bigger than what we,ep109
528,have right now you hear that what,ep109
531,nothing there's a bunch of screaming,ep109
534,kids running around downstairs so that,ep109
537,means I get to sleep during the day,ep109
540,I am glad all of the bedrooms or at,ep109
543,least on the same floor again I wish,ep109
546,that there was a bathroom attached even,ep109
549,though it wasn't nearly as close as what,ep109
552,I wanted to be to my wish list it is way,ep109
555,under budget and I like the fact that,ep109
558,the yard is so huge but it definitely,ep109
561,does stink that there's no garage,ep109
564,there's a lot that I love about this,ep109
567,house but we have to deal breakers and,ep109
570,that was a master ensuite and a garage,ep109
573,and this house has neither of those so,ep109
576,next up their agent finds an older home,ep109
579,with a garage but they might find the,ep109
582,location less than ideal,ep109
585,it's a really,ep109
588,[Music],ep109
591,do you get any sleep this morning Matt,ep109
594,and Kendra are searching for a home for,ep109
597,their expanding family in Liberty,ep109
600,Missouri so far they've seen a historic,ep109
603,craftsman that Kendra loved but it was a,ep109
606,little old for Matt and it had to deal,ep109
609,breakers no ensuite bath and no garage,ep109
612,today their agents lined up another,ep109
615,historic home with more of the features,ep109
618,they want so cute I'm thinking that is,ep109
621,old and I have no clue what potential,ep109
624,messes we could be experiencing later on,ep109
627,down the line there's a porch swing on,ep109
630,it double doors that's cool oh my gosh,ep109
633,welcome to this big beautiful historical,ep109
636,home it's old it was built in 1890 oh,ep109
639,it's really all not particularly the,ep109
642,Craftsman style you like but it does,ep109
645,have a lot of craftsman features how,ep109
648,much is it it is listed at 235 mm this,ep109
651,Victorian has been on the market for,ep109
654,quite some time so I feel pretty,ep109
657,confident that we can get it for the,ep109
660,price that Matt and Kendra are looking,ep109
663,at spending I love the fireplace and,ep109
666,these floors it just flows right into,ep109
669,the next room yes oh my gosh that's a,ep109
672,really cool fireplace and that you see,ep109
675,as pocket doors oh my these original,ep109
678,they are and they're these are pretty,ep109
681,large the floors original yes and,ep109
684,they're in good shape our thing really,ep109
687,good shape they see the dining room and,ep109
690,the first full bath on the way to the,ep109
693,kitchen,ep109
696,it's very different it is white the,ep109
699,kitchen is missing because we just have,ep109
702,one one kitchen and nothing over here,ep109
705,you put your table over there these are,ep109
708,metal cabinets huh Wow was this like the,ep109
711,bin in like the fifties it's more retro,ep109
714,than it is historical have I feel like,ep109
717,you're gonna put a lot of money in this,ep109
720,week make you happy I would love for the,ep109
723,style of the kitchen to match the rest,ep109
726,of the house this kitchen isn't terrible,ep109
729,but it could use some updates that's,ep109
732,gonna cost a lot of money there's a cute,ep109
735,little porch back here I like the garage,ep109
738,I see right now kind of a bummer that,ep109
741,it's so far away but there's room for,ep109
744,chickens I love this yard,ep109
747,except we doesn't have a fence be,ep109
750,something again we're got to spend money,ep109
753,on there's also really noisy street they,ep109
756,head up to the second floor landing,ep109
759,which opens up to the bedrooms this,ep109
762,feels like a whole other house they see,ep109
765,two bedrooms a full bath that's good and,ep109
768,the master both rooms of the master well,ep109
771,it can be because this room is odd shape,ep109
774,oh I love a separate sitting area is,ep109
777,there a master bathroom no that's for,ep109
780,this level,ep109
783,what is this room right here the closet,ep109
786,master bathroom we need to have a master,ep109
789,bathroom I can't imagine sharing a,ep109
792,bathroom with three little girls and,ep109
795,whatever kids join our family in the,ep109
798,future they head to the third floor,ep109
801,a lot of stairs kam it's a miniature,ep109
804,here we have two great big rooms one of,ep109
807,which is a kitchen,ep109
810,okay I don't really know what to do this,ep109
813,face I don't really see anybody using,ep109
816,this room up here as a bedroom because,ep109
819,it is on a different level I like how,ep109
822,there are three stories because that,ep109
825,really adds the separation of the noise,ep109
828,when I'm trying to sleep,ep109
831,I definitely don't love that but then,ep109
834,when we come back in this room the,ep109
837,beautiful entryway in the fireplaces and,ep109
840,the gorgeous ores decide we have to do,ep109
843,some work though with building the fence,ep109
846,in the backyard then whatever,ep109
849,renovations need to do to the kitchen so,ep109
852,Kim lines up the newer build that Matt,ep109
855,wants though Kendra might have to,ep109
858,sacrifice some chop porch with a budget,ep109
861,of two hundred and thirty thousand,ep109
864,dollars Matt and Kendra are hoping to,ep109
867,find a large family home and Liberty in,ep109
870,Missouri they've seen a historic,ep109
873,craftsman for 180 thousand dollars but,ep109
876,Kendra liked but it didn't have a garage,ep109
879,then they saw a Victorian with craftsman,ep109
882,touches for two hundred and thirty-five,ep109
885,thousand dollars but Matt wasn't happy,ep109
888,with the age of either home and neither,ep109
891,one had a master ensuite it's a newer,ep109
894,house it's definitely not the craftsman,ep109
897,yeah porch chance I'm going to try and,ep109
900,keep an open mind but it's going to be,ep109
903,really hard welcome to this newer home,ep109
906,Matt I like it,ep109
909,this was built in 2004 it is more,ep109
912,traditional not a craftsman and it is,ep109
915,listed at two hundred and thirty nine,ep109
918,thousand,ep109
921,then there's probably not a lot that,ep109
924,needs to be right facing to worked on so,ep109
927,it's not gonna add to the price that,ep109
930,much right we're gonna try okay the,ep109
933,dining room is right behind you I don't,ep109
936,know how I feel about the carpet we have,ep109
939,really messy kids there are options you,ep109
942,can put a big rug under the table yeah,ep109
945,that is very true I like these floors I,ep109
948,really like the coloring I do like the,ep109
951,fireplace and you put the tea that there,ep109
954,it's kind of a focal point of the room,ep109
957,ton of a little bit of a craftsman feel,ep109
960,right here a little bit you know what if,ep109
963,you paint the trim right and then you,ep109
966,paint the walls gray like it's a whole,ep109
969,other house liking this house then right,ep109
972,[Laughter],ep109
975,with it let's see the rest of the house,ep109
978,it's warm enough to you this is a really,ep109
981,small kitchen it almost just this credit,ep109
984,is what we have right now we could live,ep109
987,in this for a while but I definitely,ep109
990,would want to make this the white,ep109
993,kitchen I've always dreamed of I think,ep109
996,the biggest concern is just space to,ep109
999,make more space that would be a huge,ep109
1002,expense,ep109
1005,I think it'll longer and it'll be,ep109
1008,worthwhile because we know we start,ep109
1011,doing renovations on a kitchen we're not,ep109
1014,gonna open up the walls and find things,ep109
1017,behind the walls that we're gonna be,ep109
1020,shocked by since it's a newer home you,ep109
1023,never know so a good long really,ep109
1026,it's nice and green and it's open space,ep109
1029,it's pretty flat we didn't ask you does,ep109
1032,this house have an HOA it does I,ep109
1035,probably can't chickens correct it's not,ep109
1038,a deal-breaker for me does that mean,ep109
1041,there's a pool though in the,ep109
1044,neighborhood,ep109
1047,there is but there's a pool there's,ep109
1050,probably grounds around usually the,ep109
1053,chickens you know it doesn't make it for,ep109
1056,the chickens at all but it does make up,ep109
1059,for the size of the yard they head,ep109
1062,inside and check out the half bath and,ep109
1065,laundry room on the way to the garage oh,ep109
1068,yeah there's plenty of space in there,ep109
1071,you know what smells like a garage,ep109
1074,next they see the master I really like,ep109
1077,these ceilings my eyes kind of drawn up,ep109
1080,to them and it does make the room feel,ep109
1083,larger I think I'm thinking about is,ep109
1086,sleeping during the day and we're right,ep109
1089,outside where most the stuff goes on,ep109
1092,during the day but I like what I see,ep109
1095,right here it's huge and you each have,ep109
1098,your own sink the closet is right there,ep109
1101,I love that there's so many built-ins in,ep109
1104,here worth the extra nine thousand,ep109
1107,another room over here they go upstairs,ep109
1110,and see two bedrooms and a second full,ep109
1113,bath I really like that there's a,ep109
1116,doorway it's really important for kids,ep109
1119,in foster care to know that they have,ep109
1122,yeah before seeing the last bedroom hey,ep109
1125,that's cool I love this okay,ep109
1128,cool play yeah for the girl that's,ep109
1131,exactly right,ep109
1134,yeah cuz I can imagine them playing up,ep109
1137,here during the day while I'm downstairs,ep109
1140,sleeping and that would keep the noise,ep109
1143,levels down in the main level home it's,ep109
1146,just a nice feature you know it's like,ep109
1149,you could find this in an older home I,ep109
1152,like it of course because it's a newer,ep109
1155,build and it has a really great yard,ep109
1158,outside the sleeping is you know on the,ep109
1161,same level as all the action where the,ep109
1164,kitchen the living room is I think that,ep109
1167,we can easily remedy that with the extra,ep109
1170,play room we have upstairs well,ep109
1173,obviously it was not quite my style but,ep109
1176,I love the master bathroom I mean that,ep109
1179,really got my heart throb and I really,ep109
1182,liked that I even 90 feet can at the,ep109
1185,open floor plan the kitchens kind of,ep109
1188,small I probably won't get any chickens,ep109
1191,which I'm really bummed about I need my,ep109
1194,chickens just think about your bathtub,ep109
1197,it's decision time and it might all come,ep109
1200,down to the lure of a modern master,ep109
1203,ensuite versus historic charm I'm a,ep109
1206,little sick to my stomach right now,ep109
1209,[Applause],ep109
1212,geez we want a slide with a budget of,ep109
1215,"230,000 dollars",ep109
1218,Kendra and Matt have been searching for,ep109
1221,a home in Liberty Missouri that's big,ep109
1224,enough to make room in their young,ep109
1227,family for adopted foster children,ep109
1230,they've seen several possible places but,ep109
1233,now it's time to make a decision let's,ep109
1236,start with the the green craftsman that,ep109
1239,was the only one that was under budget,ep109
1242,that yard was awesome was quite one of,ep109
1245,the best features of that house actually,ep109
1248,I could definitely have chickens in that,ep109
1251,year and your chickens two stories I,ep109
1254,could sleep during the day obviously I,ep109
1257,love the Craftsman style the big thing,ep109
1260,is there's no garage and there is no,ep109
1263,master bathroom in fact we would be,ep109
1266,sharing a bathroom with all of the kids,ep109
1269,but about the Victorians it's an older,ep109
1272,home it's already over budget but when,ep109
1275,you walked into that home I mean just,ep109
1278,the front door it just told the story,ep109
1281,those pocket doors were awesome yeah and,ep109
1284,they seemed to be a really good shape to,ep109
1287,it and it had a three-car garage so,ep109
1290,fourth bedroom which we really need is,ep109
1293,on the very very top level on that that,ep109
1296,kitchen is really out of data it did not,ep109
1299,have that master ensuite what about that,ep109
1302,newer building we're not gonna have to,ep109
1305,put a ton of work in it to be moving,ep109
1308,ready you say that but that kitchen we,ep109
1311,aren't really gonna have the money to,ep109
1314,spend because it's at the top of our,ep109
1317,price range it does have two and a half,ep109
1320,bathrooms actually it was the only house,ep109
1323,we saw that had a master bathroom like,ep109
1326,we really wanted that yard was awesome I,ep109
1329,can't believe that you loved that yard I,ep109
1332,mean it's like a quarter of the size of,ep109
1335,the yard a Victorian home so which one,ep109
1338,will they choose,ep109
1341,[Music],ep109
1344,when I walked into the craftsman I could,ep109
1347,picture it all you know really did feel,ep109
1350,like home I think I had that gut feeling,ep109
1353,too as if it was made for you know,ep109
1356,family just like us to live in it so is,ep109
1359,that it,ep109
1362,I think without regret I would choose,ep109
1365,this house with you yeah we can,ep109
1368,eventually put shower and the main level,ep109
1371,bathroom later on down the line because,ep109
1374,it's only 180 thousand that's all,ep109
1377,they're asking for it ready talked again,ep109
1380,yeah,ep109
1383,then this kitchen is great hon it's,ep109
1386,great we closed three weeks ago and we,ep109
1389,moved in about a week and a half ago,ep109
1392,"your turn they were asking 180,000 and",ep109
1395,we offered full price than it makes an,ep109
1398,offer within hours which was a relief,ep109
1401,because I don't think we could have,ep109
1404,handled it I love this porch man this is,ep109
1407,great,ep109
1410,I need to I got my historic home Matt I,ep109
1413,think had to compromise them most out of,ep109
1416,the two of us he is going to have a lot,ep109
1419,of work to do on this home over the,ep109
1422,years just to keep it up the thing that,ep109
1425,really want me over about this house is,ep109
1428,it was cool to just sit back and just,ep109
1431,watch the kids play in the backyard,ep109
1434,which is really what's worth it to me,ep109
1437,it's all yours,ep109
1440,and they love their room at our old,ep109
1443,house you didn't have any room for your,ep109
1446,tent in your room it's just two of them,ep109
1449,and you can tell that they actually,ep109
1452,really like that I have great plans for,ep109
1455,our bathroom on the main level,ep109
1458,don't use that you'll gouge the wall in,ep109
1461,the next probably six months we'll,ep109
1464,probably end up putting a bathtub in,ep109
1467,that bathroom it sounds a little bit,ep109
1470,crazy but we were willing to sacrifice a,ep109
1473,master bathroom for character ask us,ep109
1476,this question again six months who knows,ep109
1479,how will feel we have picked out our,ep109
1482,chickens but now it still has to build,ep109
1485,the chicken coop and then they can come,ep109
1488,home,ep109
1491,once this home is approved we'll be,ep109
1494,ready to open up her home to foster care,ep109
1497,again you even have your own we have,ep109
1500,always wanted our home to be at least,ep109
1503,where guests visitors other people,ep109
1506,foster children can come and find peace,ep109
1509,and joy and,ep109
1512,are filled with laughter so it's kind of,ep109
1515,our yeah the chicken say,ep109
1518,[Music],ep109
12,don't worry Jane they've got a bed for,ep110
15,everyone Steve and Jane always shared,ep110
18,enough for trapped this is lovely,ep110
21,this is a little bit of Surrey in your,ep110
24,own backyard and now an opportunity to,ep110
27,teach abroad as them trading their,ep110
30,hectic lives our whole goal here is to,ep110
33,not have a car for something,ep110
36,quintessentially English it's so,ep110
39,different for other school and there's,ep110
42,even a ferry how else can you get over,ep110
45,you could swim but can they find the,ep110
48,right house it's a 25 minute drive from,ep110
51,school I'm afraid where's the furniture,ep110
54,so we leave No,ep110
57,[Music],ep110
60,hi hi welcome even I met when I got my,ep110
63,first full-time job covering sports at a,ep110
66,local newspaper I was coaching tennis,ep110
69,and I knew I had a great player and I,ep110
72,called the paper to get their tennis,ep110
75,reporter out there and they sent out a,ep110
78,rookie reporter we are looking at homes,ep110
81,tomorrow so we've got the whole day to,ep110
84,play with what we'd like to do I did ask,ep110
87,him out after the season was over,ep110
90,because I just couldn't stop thinking,ep110
93,about him and then we quickly became,ep110
96,engaged and I said I don't want to get,ep110
99,an engagement ring because I want to use,ep110
102,that money to be able to go somewhere,ep110
105,really big for anymore we went to,ep110
108,Indonesia and to Thailand let's go,ep110
111,everybody,ep110
114,here we go we have two amazing daughters,ep110
117,Jeanne is 14 and Charlotte is 13 they've,ep110
120,lived in the same place their whole,ep110
123,lives and we thought let's make the,ep110
126,world a little bit bigger for that I'm,ep110
129,gonna be starting to teach at Marymount,ep110
132,International School which I'm extremely,ep110
135,excited about and the additional,ep110
138,excitement is having both of my,ep110
141,daughters there while Jane has taken,ep110
144,care of all of the home logistics I'm,ep110
147,gonna be trying to make sure I know the,ep110
150,curriculum well getting to know the new,ep110
153,schedule our girls have lived in one,ep110
156,place for their entire lives and we're,ep110
159,putting them in a completely new,ep110
162,environment so it's important for us,ep110
165,that they have a place where they still,ep110
168,feel like that foundation and that home,ep110
171,is their Surrey is a beautiful rural,ep110
174,County as within 30 to 40 minutes,ep110
177,commute of central London there are lots,ep110
180,of kind of sixteenth and,ep110
183,seventeenth-century properties and that,ep110
186,gives the area really lovely kind of,ep110
189,rich historical feel we're looking at a,ep110
192,minimum of three bedrooms we have two,ep110
195,girls they are not going to be sharing a,ep110
198,room so we really need to at least have,ep110
201,a three bedroom now that said you,ep110
204,definitely need a dedicated workspace,ep110
207,because I'm gonna be spending a lot of,ep110
210,time writing I've been a sports writer,ep110
213,for the last 20 years so what I really,ep110
216,want to look forward to is maybe,ep110
219,research for an upcoming book tell me,ep110
222,about the sort of area that you're,ep110
225,interested in Steve's gonna be teaching,ep110
228,at a school in Surrey and the kids will,ep110
231,be going there as well,ep110
234,so we want to be close to the school it,ep110
237,would be great to be able to walk I,ep110
240,don't want to be on a bus a train but if,ep110
243,we found the perfect place and it was a,ep110
246,short bus ride away I'm gonna think we'd,ep110
249,have to consider that now what about a,ep110
252,periods charm versus modern where do you,ep110
255,stand on,ep110
258,I think I lean more towards modern I,ep110
261,would love to have something that's,ep110
264,proper English you know that would be,ep110
267,really nice you would rather have a,ep110
270,fireplace than a dishwashers it's what,ep110
273,we're saying Jane you know what I can't,ep110
276,believe I'm saying this but yes can I,ep110
279,just ask for at least two bathrooms in,ep110
282,the home with three women in the house,ep110
285,I think that's becoming more of a,ep110
288,priority okay we also need to have it,ep110
291,fully furnished because we've come here,ep110
294,with very little how much money have we,ep110
297,"got to spend maximum budget is $3,200",ep110
300,okay are you ready to start,ep110
303,house-hunting let's go okay I'm not sure,ep110
306,we're gonna be able to find a property,ep110
309,that's gonna be within walking distance,ep110
312,of the school Steve's aversion to wheels,ep110
315,is worrying me somewhat Richard first,ep110
318,selects a unique three-bedroom cottage,ep110
321,fronting on the towns I can't wait to,ep110
324,bring Jana Steve to this property is so,ep110
327,unique here just by the river and on an,ep110
330,island now the house is across this,ep110
333,ferry and just down that street over,ep110
336,there across the ferry that's right this,ep110
339,is an amazing chain ferry do you get on,ep110
342,there and then you would just have a,ep110
345,cross so how else can you get over you,ep110
348,could swim we've got a three bed one and,ep110
351,a half bath property okay we're about 30,ep110
354,minutes into the city center from here,ep110
357,and 25 minutes walk to your school it's,ep110
360,got a garden that looks out onto the,ep110
363,"riverfront and it's on budget at $3,200",ep110
366,that's good at the same time three,ep110
369,bedrooms one and a half in one and a,ep110
372,half baths and also the water bit,ep110
375,concerned from the moment that you step,ep110
378,foot on the ferry to get to this,ep110
381,property it is completely unique and you,ep110
384,have this beautiful river scape in front,ep110
387,of you it's extraordinary,ep110
390,now this is the actual property now guys,ep110
393,wow this is really unexpected I could,ep110
396,really see Charlotte hunting for frogs,ep110
399,out here yeah this is amazing oh this is,ep110
402,cute it's kind of like a vacation cabin,ep110
405,it is feels very Cape Cod II yeah,ep110
408,exactly,ep110
411,that's a nice size table I thought the,ep110
414,wood-burning stove yeah here's a little,ep110
417,look for you to write your great,ep110
420,American novel it's a little bit closed,ep110
423,in but I think it would probably work,ep110
426,and I mean you know the view you can't,ep110
429,really beat it yeah,ep110
432,is a spectacular setting it feels like,ep110
435,you're in the middle of nowhere and that,ep110
438,you've just got you in the river right,ep110
441,there what do you think of the kitchen,ep110
444,then J well there's not a lot of extra,ep110
447,space necessarily and you know the,ep110
450,refrigerator is tiny you do have a,ep110
453,washer and dryer that's just a washer,ep110
456,let me show you the dryer excuse me,ep110
459,famous last words this is your dryer pop,ep110
462,your clothes on there and then pull the,ep110
465,pulley how do you feel about cooking,ep110
468,with clothes that are drying directly,ep110
471,over your head I don't know how I feel,ep110
474,about stirring the soup and looking up,ep110
477,and there are my underpants isn't that,ep110
480,English charm,ep110
483,[Laughter],ep110
486,now come through to this bedroom I think,ep110
489,this would be one of the kids bedrooms,ep110
492,it's certainly spacious enough I'm not,ep110
495,crazy about carpet I mean look it's,ep110
498,functional now we have another bedroom,ep110
501,here with patio doors this time I love,ep110
504,it this is totally spacious it's got a,ep110
507,lot of charm I love the wood in this,ep110
510,room this is a nicer room for sure,ep110
513,here's the family bathroom guys have a,ep110
516,look very basic what do you think I'm,ep110
519,not a huge fan of this green but it does,ep110
522,have all the requirements I think you,ep110
525,could definitely use a facelift look,ep110
528,this is the master bedroom it's got this,ep110
531,is boudoir here that's very cute I love,ep110
534,the view that cannot be beat now you've,ep110
537,got another bonus which is that the half,ep110
540,bath is just off the bedroom as you can,ep110
543,see there Oh Steve it's a closet slash,ep110
546,shower yeah so what did you think of the,ep110
549,property overall I really love the,ep110
552,location I love the setup with the,ep110
555,living room and even most of the kitchen,ep110
558,yeah I think there was really lots of,ep110
561,love particularly this setting it would,ep110
564,be completely unique for Jeanne and,ep110
567,Charlotte to have an experience growing,ep110
570,up here I think that would be fantastic,ep110
573,that said after drying the clothes once,ep110
576,or twice I might get tired of that and,ep110
579,the bathroom situation I think in the,ep110
582,morning would be really difficult I'm a,ep110
585,bit worried about Jane perhaps being a,ep110
588,bit more conservative than I'd like I,ep110
591,think she's one of these people that,ep110
594,likes to see the big picture and then,ep110
597,she'll want to sit back and make a,ep110
600,decision a traditional four bedroom,ep110
603,townhouse gets them back on dry land you,ep110
606,really could not get more British than,ep110
609,this street but it isn't perfect now,ep110
612,tell me about the commute to school,ep110
615,here we go guys your new school I really,ep110
618,like walking here it's very pleasant,ep110
621,well I'm glad we're gonna be doing it,ep110
624,every day back and forth with a nice,ep110
627,walk a new teaching job has made it,ep110
630,possible for Steve Jane and their,ep110
633,daughters to move from suburban New York,ep110
636,to the English countryside from the,ep110
639,start traveling was our plan the early,ep110
642,years of travel with our kids but spent,ep110
645,mainly in amusement parks which is all,ep110
648,well and good and I just realized that,ep110
651,they really are ready for some kind of,ep110
654,adventure they've come to Surrey to give,ep110
657,the girls a brand new view of their,ep110
660,world they're gonna be going from a huge,ep110
663,public school to a small private school,ep110
666,with uniforms and very British,ep110
669,experience yeah this is quite a place I,ep110
672,can't believe we're gonna be here every,ep110
675,single day teaching doesn't even look,ep110
678,like a school I think I'll be able to do,ep110
681,that and while Steve and the girls are,ep110
684,at school,ep110
687,Jane plans to write a book at home so,ep110
690,Richard showed them a quiet riverfront,ep110
693,cottage with its own unique approach,ep110
696,this is an amazing chain ferry you get,ep110
699,on there and then you wind yourself,ep110
702,across a beautiful living room this is,ep110
705,cute it's kind of like a vacation cabin,ep110
708,feels very Cape Cod II but some,ep110
711,impractical features as well this is,ep110
714,your dryer pop your clothes on there and,ep110
717,then up they go Oh Steve it's a closet,ep110
720,slash shower yeah what do you think I,ep110
723,think it's gonna be an okay place to go,ep110
726,to school I believe I can hang out here,ep110
729,for a while,ep110
732,Richard steers the hunt to a more,ep110
735,traditional English home for the family,ep110
738,I'm gonna show Steve and Jane a four-bed,ep110
741,property but it is a 25-minute car,ep110
744,journey to the school and I think Steve,ep110
747,is gonna be quite upset about that you,ep110
750,really could not get more British than,ep110
753,this street it's true isn't it and we've,ep110
756,come to Twickenham now with just 30,ep110
759,minutes into central London and we've,ep110
762,come to see this very nice for bed one,ep110
765,and a half bath house what do you think,ep110
768,it looks charming I love the way that,ep110
771,there's a little bit of greenery around,ep110
774,everything I like the ideas of four,ep110
777,bedrooms it's nice and light and,ep110
780,"spacious and it's under budget at $3,000",ep110
783,oh great good yeah definitely now tell,ep110
786,me about the commute to school it's a,ep110
789,25-minute drive I'm afraid there is a,ep110
792,bus as well that you can get to school,ep110
795,well it is under budget it is four,ep110
798,bedrooms so I'm willing to take a look,ep110
801,okay well let's go and have a look I,ep110
804,would spend a little bit more money to,ep110
807,get closer to school,ep110
810,right come true we'll go straight,ep110
813,through to the living room okay that's,ep110
816,nice Wow,ep110
819,fireplace fireplace James really,ep110
822,beautiful yeah and you've got this,ep110
825,lovely big bay window here so it's nice,ep110
828,and light and bright and all of this,ep110
831,light floods through into the dining,ep110
834,area it's goes through to the kitchen,ep110
837,very impressive I love the skylights I,ep110
840,love the island everything looks really,ep110
843,modern you've got a double oven here,ep110
846,you've also got a dishwasher here,ep110
849,fantastic,ep110
852,now I want to show you this lovely,ep110
855,feature here Wow,ep110
858,in the summer time this would be amazing,ep110
861,house nice it's not really a garden but,ep110
864,it is outdoor isn't quiet,ep110
867,you have got space supports more shrubs,ep110
870,around the edges if you wanted to lots,ep110
873,here as well right that deck is not,ep110
876,really a full garden sort of garden ish,ep110
879,but it's still a remarkable spot Dada,ep110
882,you have this massive master bedroom,ep110
885,this is nice it's a huge space I mean,ep110
888,even though they don't have a closet,ep110
891,they do have room for a big wardrobe,ep110
894,floors are nice get good light it looks,ep110
897,like a big morning light so that would,ep110
900,be a bonus let's have a look at the,ep110
903,family bathroom we've got this really,ep110
906,nice feature bathtub I loved it a nice,ep110
909,walk-in shower cubicle there you also,ep110
912,got the basin over here this bathroom is,ep110
915,fantastic for me and Gina Charlotte,ep110
918,lovely Jane why don't you go through,ep110
921,there I think that would be ideal as,ep110
924,your study oh yeah I like the details,ep110
927,that's very cute okay and have a look at,ep110
930,this other bedroom here oh this is nice,ep110
933,I think Gina and Charlotte might argue,ep110
936,over who gets this one for sure that,ep110
939,light is amazing take a look at this,ep110
942,guy's oh my goodness this is small oh I,ep110
945,don't know if we could really make do,ep110
948,with this you've got a toilet a basin a,ep110
951,mirror we live here I'm gonna forever,ep110
954,call this the timeout bathroom as much,ep110
957,as I like this house it would be really,ep110
960,tough for us given the commute we don't,ep110
963,want to be spending a lot of time in,ep110
966,vehicles what do you think of the,ep110
969,property overall I think there's a lot,ep110
972,of potential there starting you know,ep110
975,from the living room where you have that,ep110
978,beautiful big window and the fireplace,ep110
981,and then the kitchen was pretty,ep110
984,extraordinary wasn't expecting to see a,ep110
987,kitchen like that for me I'd really love,ep110
990,to be closer to the school that's my,ep110
993,biggest concern if the street were to,ep110
996,lead right to the school,ep110
999,it'd be great I feel I really need to,ep110
1002,take Jane heceta property that's right,ep110
1005,next to school so I'm gonna do that but,ep110
1008,something's wrong,ep110
1011,so we leave no I wonder how these,ep110
1014,buildings are probably older than,ep110
1017,America,ep110
1020,Steve Jane and daughters Jean and,ep110
1023,Charlotte have moved to England from,ep110
1026,their suburban home near New York City,ep110
1029,look at this they've lived in the same,ep110
1032,place their whole lives and we thought,ep110
1035,let's make the world a little bit bigger,ep110
1038,for them Steve will teach at the girls,ep110
1041,new school in Surrey while Jane gets,ep110
1044,started on a book she wants to write,ep110
1047,I've been a sports writer for the last,ep110
1050,20 years and I've covered tennis and,ep110
1053,basketball and in c-double-a sports and,ep110
1056,professional football for a long time,ep110
1059,now they need a home that suits,ep110
1062,everybody we want to be close to the,ep110
1065,school it would be great to be able to,ep110
1068,walk with enough living space we have,ep110
1071,two girls they are not going to be,ep110
1074,sharing a room and we definitely need a,ep110
1077,dedicated workspace because I'm gonna be,ep110
1080,spending a lot of time writing thank you,ep110
1083,very much thank you all right you'll be,ep110
1086,seeing us again a house on the Thames,ep110
1089,accessible only by a hand-powered chain,ep110
1092,ferry gives Jane the work space she,ep110
1095,needs it's a little bit closed in but,ep110
1098,the view you can't really beat it,ep110
1101,yeah the look and feel of an English,ep110
1104,cottage this is really unexpected I,ep110
1107,could really see Charlotte hunting for,ep110
1110,frogs out here with a new experience for,ep110
1113,the girls it would be completely unique,ep110
1116,for Jeanne and Charlotte to have an,ep110
1119,experience growing up here the four,ep110
1122,bedroom townhouse has a more traditional,ep110
1125,appeal oh wow in the summertime this,ep110
1128,would be,ep110
1131,how's that but there's one big downside,ep110
1134,it's too far from the school I finally,ep110
1137,found a property that is just ten,ep110
1140,minutes walk from Steve's school that I,ep110
1143,think will be suitable for him and Jane,ep110
1146,and the kids so I hope they're gonna,ep110
1149,appreciate it,ep110
1152,I've brought you to the quiet leafy,ep110
1155,suburb of New Malden look at these,ep110
1158,lovely trees here and it's just a,ep110
1161,10-minute walk to school fantastic we're,ep110
1164,about a 20 minute walk to the station,ep110
1167,but then it's just 20 minutes into,ep110
1170,central London so it is only three beds,ep110
1173,but it is two baths fantastic we're also,ep110
1176,"right on budget here because it's $3,200",ep110
1179,fantastic should we go in and have a,ep110
1182,look yes how about this guys look at,ep110
1185,this massive living room it is a massive,ep110
1188,living room and empty where's the,ep110
1191,furniture the property just come with,ep110
1194,beds but you would need to get so first,ep110
1197,a dining room table and that sort of,ep110
1200,thing it's really important that the,ep110
1203,place we rent is fully furnished because,ep110
1206,I don't want to be living on the floor I,ep110
1209,had that fun when college and I'm past,ep110
1212,that I think I might be in denial about,ep110
1215,the lack of furniture here I do see,ep110
1218,their concern that they're going to have,ep110
1221,"to spend probably $2,000 but I just",ep110
1224,think the property is so right for them,ep110
1227,shall we leave no well if we're staying,ep110
1230,let's have a look at the room in a bit,ep110
1233,more detail look at this nice big,ep110
1236,fireplace here it's clearly a really,ep110
1239,beautiful piece now you have another,ep110
1242,nice big blank canvas here you're,ep110
1245,immediately struck by this gorgeous,ep110
1248,garden that's right out there too well,ep110
1251,look it's great for cooking rustling up,ep110
1254,food for the family a nicely appointed,ep110
1257,kitchen here two others nice double oven,ep110
1260,yes and we've got a dishwasher as well,ep110
1263,I'm noticing out these windows all of,ep110
1266,this beautiful greenery well let's go,ep110
1269,and have a look at the guard,ep110
1272,okay now look you've got these nice,ep110
1275,patio doors here well shall we go oh my,ep110
1278,this is a garden you could choose to sit,ep110
1281,out here or there's another space down,ep110
1284,there follow me the problem is that,ep110
1287,having the garden doesn't offset the,ep110
1290,cost of new furniture is it a compromise,ep110
1293,worth making this is lovely,ep110
1296,this is a little bit of Surrey in your,ep110
1299,own backyard,ep110
1302,think about the girls they would love,ep110
1305,this away with the fairies back soon,ep110
1308,it's perfect I just,ep110
1311,think we'd be able to get this kind of,ep110
1314,space so close to London and so close to,ep110
1317,the school,ep110
1320,Jane and Steve Haley's bathroom number,ep110
1323,one have a look this works and it's,ep110
1326,certainly large enough for a full-grown,ep110
1329,person I believe so it's a full second,ep110
1332,bath yeah let's take a look at the main,ep110
1335,master bedroom guys which is this one,ep110
1338,basis a lot of great light coming into,ep110
1341,and storage that's good we can certainly,ep110
1344,make do with this they like the light,ep110
1347,airy open spaciousness of the property,ep110
1350,but I'm really worried about the lack of,ep110
1353,furniture even though it's on budget and,ep110
1356,close to school that's definitely been a,ep110
1359,big issue for them so what did you think,ep110
1362,about the property overall guys it is,ep110
1365,absolutely charming the garden is,ep110
1368,amazing but it's not furnished having to,ep110
1371,buy furniture for our place is really a,ep110
1374,concern all of that adds up to money and,ep110
1377,time the biggest concern for me is that,ep110
1380,it's a 40-minute commute to work each,ep110
1383,day it's just a matter of whether or not,ep110
1386,having an adequate amount of space and a,ep110
1389,really charming neighborhood offsets the,ep110
1392,commute that you'd have to do every day,ep110
1395,a little bit damp here well we are in,ep110
1398,England 17 years ago a cub reporter met,ep110
1401,a high school tennis coach in suburban,ep110
1404,New York I was given the assignment of,ep110
1407,covering the boys tennis and I met the,ep110
1410,boys tennis coach now the coach the,ep110
1413,sports writer and their two teenage,ep110
1416,daughters have moved to Surrey in,ep110
1419,southeast England they've had a,ep110
1422,wonderful experience growing up in,ep110
1425,Ossining they've lived in the same place,ep110
1428,their whole lives and we thought let's,ep110
1431,just make the world a little bit bigger,ep110
1434,for that with different priorities about,ep110
1437,living space and distance to school,ep110
1440,they've seen three properties beginning,ep110
1443,with a cottage on the Thames I could,ep110
1446,really see Charlotte hunting for frogs,ep110
1449,out here yeah this is amazing I did love,ep110
1452,the views in that River House it was,ep110
1455,such a unique setting and I think I,ep110
1458,could be pretty creative there it's a,ep110
1461,great work space kind of isolated but at,ep110
1464,the same time in the middle of,ep110
1467,everything just a 20-minute walk to,ep110
1470,school for you guys but I'm a little,ep110
1473,reluctant to live on Islands not sure,ep110
1476,why what were your thoughts about it,ep110
1479,it's like an engineering course for the,ep110
1482,kids and how you use pulleys and levers,ep110
1485,the more traditional town house has four,ep110
1488,bedrooms and a workroom for Jane there,ep110
1491,was a lot of space in that house that,ep110
1494,was pretty useful but if downstairs was,ep110
1497,really big with that bay window all of,ep110
1500,this light floods through into the,ep110
1503,dining area and through to the kitchen,ep110
1506,and then if you looked at the kitchen,ep110
1509,also a lot of space I like the deck out,ep110
1512,back I wasn't really a much of a garden,ep110
1515,but you could entertain a bit out there,ep110
1518,the biggest concern for me is that it's,ep110
1521,a 40-minute commute to work each day but,ep110
1524,it's under budget and it's furnished now,ep110
1527,what about the garden house the garden,ep110
1530,house has a lot to like but we have to,ep110
1533,start off with a huge negative it's not,ep110
1536,furnished and it's at the top of our,ep110
1539,budget,ep110
1542,the gardens do it for me it's a two,ep110
1545,Gardens this is lovely this is a little,ep110
1548,bit of Surrey in your own backyard and,ep110
1551,definitely a very English type of style,ep110
1554,and I think just coming home under that,ep110
1557,little archway would kind of make it,ep110
1560,seem charming you mentioned my favorite,ep110
1563,part of that house the coming home part,ep110
1566,that is a 10-minute walk from school,ep110
1569,[Music],ep110
1572,I think we know which one is the least,ep110
1575,practical option for our family what do,ep110
1578,you think I think we probably agree,ep110
1581,what's yours River House is ridiculous,ep110
1584,I am NOT gonna be cranking my way across,ep110
1587,a river to get to my home day and night,ep110
1590,that's true,ep110
1593,all right the river house is out so it's,ep110
1596,between the town house and the garden,ep110
1599,house I think we have a lot to think,ep110
1602,about with those two because each of,ep110
1605,them kind of have different things we,ep110
1608,really like about them,ep110
1611,the town has some great qualities,ep110
1614,including an extra bedroom which we,ep110
1617,could use for friends or relatives and,ep110
1620,you could easily convert into an office,ep110
1623,the kitchen was huge and then the,ep110
1626,accordion doors that opened up into the,ep110
1629,patio it gives us a lot of extra space,ep110
1632,and on a nice day it gives us an extra,ep110
1635,room it is under budget however it is a,ep110
1638,very long commute to school okay the,ep110
1641,garden house had a lot of positive,ep110
1644,qualities also you just don't love the,ep110
1647,idea of furnishing it the garden house,ep110
1650,"is $3,200 which is at the very top of",ep110
1653,"our budget while the townhouse is $3,000",ep110
1656,a month which means that we would have a,ep110
1659,little bit of extra money to play with,ep110
1662,let's talk about the garden house for a,ep110
1665,second okay I really liked the fact that,ep110
1668,it had two beautiful gardens yeah and we,ep110
1671,didn't see that really in any other,ep110
1674,place right and it has two human-sized,ep110
1677,bathrooms for me though you know it's,ep110
1680,gonna be me who is unpacking the,ep110
1683,furniture,ep110
1686,and it's gonna be expensive yeah also I,ep110
1689,didn't really spot an obvious spot for,ep110
1692,you to do any writing let me just make,ep110
1695,the case for the townhouse it really has,ep110
1698,all the space inside that we need for me,ep110
1701,it provides an office it's so far away,ep110
1704,from school but it's under budget it's,ep110
1707,gonna be me and Gina and Charlotte doing,ep110
1710,that community twice a day so I really,ep110
1713,feel like that's a deal breaker for me,ep110
1716,anytime well I see your point with the,ep110
1719,garden house it's utterly charming it is,ep110
1722,just such a special location and you,ep110
1725,won't have to commute so we're settled,ep110
1728,the garden house the garden house I,ep110
1731,think we'll be happy there let's go tell,ep110
1734,my church okay,ep110
1737,goodbye Jane have a great day at school,ep110
1740,guys life in Surrey,ep110
1743,couldn't be better we are close to,ep110
1746,everything we've got shopping nearby we,ep110
1749,were able to get furniture and now we're,ep110
1752,just settling in and enjoying everything,ep110
1755,England has to offer it is less than a,ep110
1758,miles walk to the tenants facility so,ep110
1761,I'm super happy about that - Gina,ep110
1764,Charlotte have made a lot of friends,ep110
1767,here they have a degree of freedom here,ep110
1770,that's a lot more than they experienced,ep110
1773,in New York and at their age that's,ep110
1776,actually really good I love having my,ep110
1779,own bathroom it was kind of fun trying,ep110
1782,to pick out a place for the office,ep110
1785,figuring out where in the space at best,ep110
1788,fit and I found a really beautiful old,ep110
1791,antique table and chair set that I,ep110
1794,really feel like is gonna work perfectly,ep110
1797,for us this whole adventure has been a,ep110
1800,really fantastic experience for Jane and,ep110
1803,I having to take on this challenge,ep110
1806,together it's been really fun it's kind,ep110
1809,of an adventure that we're all doing at,ep110
1812,the same time and in the same way and so,ep110
1815,for us it's really brought the family,ep110
1818,closer together,ep110
1821,[Music],ep110
12,oh my god I love this kitchen,ep111
15,Stephanie and Steven won a grand home in,ep111
18,the Boston suburbs Oh finally high,ep111
21,ceilings problem is old it's not good,ep111
24,new is always better but you can make,ep111
27,old new thank you and with each having,ep111
30,very different styles still looks pretty,ep111
33,old to me I'm not Victoria,ep111
36,I am very excited to be looking at a,ep111
39,colonial yes it is a cloning sweetheart,ep111

45,hate the exposed radiator but look honey,ep111

60,[Music],ep111
63,[Applause],ep111

69,name is Stephanie and I work for an,ep111
72,advertising agency,ep111
75,let's check in alright looking good my,ep111
78,name is Steven and I'm a radiologist,ep111
81,we've been married for about a month now,ep111
84,we met online on a dating site we've,ep111
87,some for me I went to sprinkle of course,ep111
90,so she drove up and when she got out of,ep111
93,a car is thinking right away awhile I,ep111
96,hit the jackpot sharing what I do like,ep111
99,about her is that 90% of time she'll,ep111
102,agree with what I say he thinks I'm,ep111
105,agreeing with him I just know to just,ep111
108,stop talking in my mind I can be right I,ep111
111,just will stop forcing it on him hey,ep111
114,there you go we currently live in the,ep111
117,Back Bay of Boston in a condo that's,ep111
120,roughly 850 square feet I love watching,ep111
123,sailboats go across I love the diversity,ep111
126,of the people within the city just doing,ep111
129,all the fun things I think it makes it,ep111
132,super fun to just kind of walk around,ep111
135,and see everyone and what they do people,ep111
138,watching great for entertaining guests,ep111
141,from out of town because there's a lot,ep111
144,of history in Boston I have a four year,ep111
147,old go,ep111
150,he's very high-energy so he's constantly,ep111
153,running around so my office which I used,ep111
156,to have became his bedroom but it's not,ep111
159,very big and he has lots of toys so,ep111
162,really it's just were cramped that we,ep111
165,really need to get more space have you,ep111
168,seen my compact we're thinking about,ep111
171,moving to the suburbs of Boston close,ep111
174,enough to our family's still far enough,ep111
177,away though it doesn't really matter,ep111
180,where I'm located as long as I have a,ep111
183,computer and an Internet I can read the,ep111
186,MRIs there's no evidence of any fracture,ep111
189,period and make diagnoses to save,ep111
192,people's lives this is a gorgeous living,ep111
195,room type of home that we're looking for,ep111
198,would definitely have to be four,ep111
201,"bedrooms it should be at least 2,500",ep111
204,"square feet in the 750,000 to 1.1",ep111
207,million dollar price range I'm,ep111
210,definitely more willing to go over that,ep111
213,budget because I would like to buy a,ep111
216,house that's already completely done has,ep111
219,all the upgrades that I'm looking for,ep111
222,Steve and I know is more looking to,ep111
225,staying in the lower price point of the,ep111
228,budget that we said I'm okay with having,ep111
231,something that's a little bit older and,ep111
234,then renovating into a more modern type,ep111
237,failing old is not good which you can,ep111
240,make old new now you can't just buy it,ep111
243,that is gorgeous that's the style of my,ep111
246,dream home would be colonial Colonials,ep111
249,have all the bedrooms upstairs gives you,ep111
252,that kind of separation from people,ep111
255,hanging out in your house and you know,ep111
258,personal areas upstairs I know Stephen,ep111
261,is more so interested in Victorians and,ep111
264,really know that much about Victoria,ep111
267,Chris and Wyndmere move on Victoria's,ep111
270,because they'll have a lot of nooks and,ep111
273,crannies in different sized rooms it's,ep111
276,kind of going in there's an electric,ep111
279,fireplace ideally I would like to have a,ep111
282,wood-burning fireplace,ep111
285,so my wish list is definitely an office,ep111
288,because I spend a lot of time there and,ep111
291,I want to be able to enjoy myself while,ep111
294,I'm working there have to be high,ep111
297,ceilings otherwise I start feeling,ep111
300,claustrophobic,ep111
303,they both want a fenced-in yard for,ep111
306,Dominik to play in and an open kitchen I,ep111
309,really really like the white cabinets,ep111
312,I like the apply it seems like it's yeah,ep111
315,really nice updated appliances I love,ep111
318,having a kitchen island,ep111
321,serve both definitely very strong-willed,ep111
324,individuals and we both definitely,ep111
327,have certain opinions that we don't see,ep111
330,eye-to-eye on well the way we would,ep111
333,compromise I feel is that I could maybe,ep111
336,steer her towards going for a style home,ep111
339,that I like a little bit better since I,ep111
342,do work at home a lot not gonna let you,ep111
345,in that easy,ep111
348,first up a new bill for Stephanie oh my,ep111
351,god I'm in love with this house right,ep111
354,now it's gonna be really pricey I can,ep111
357,tell it's a new construction the inside,ep111
360,yeah and I already know I love it so,ep111
363,today we are in Lynn field located north,ep111
366,of Boston this is a brand-new,ep111
369,construction colonial house it's gonna,ep111
372,"be about 3,500 square feet",ep111
375,it's listed at 1.15 million ooh,ep111
378,so Amy tells us the price of the house,ep111
381,and I'm about to have a heart attack I,ep111
384,know that is over your max budget of 1.1,ep111
387,right I'm not really too concerned about,ep111
390,the price I am willing to go up in,ep111
393,budget if I got the type of home that,ep111
396,I'm looking for I love this house the,ep111
399,grand entrance I love this stairway,ep111
402,going up the hardwood floors it's white,ep111
405,I love I knew you would Steven you might,ep111
408,like this room over here to your right,ep111
411,agree you could use this as an office,ep111
414,space well it's a little kind of plain,ep111
417,kind of a small boxed area but I guess,ep111
420,it could work is my office well let's,ep111
423,continue on into the kitchen oh my god I,ep111
426,love this kitchen,ep111
429,it's my all white cabinets I have,ep111
432,windows letting in so much light I like,ep111
435,the island and I love these appliances,ep111
438,this is perfect the only thing I am,ep111
441,slightly noticing though is it seems a,ep111
444,little tight yeah I notice of the,ep111
447,kitchen he's narrowly into the family,ep111
450,room,ep111
453,Stephanie we have a fireplace for you,ep111
456,I'm excited but it's not wood-burning I,ep111
459,really was hoping for a wood-burning,ep111
462,fireplace but but it's very,ep111
465,aesthetically pleasing I like how it,ep111
468,looks let's go look at the backyard it's,ep111
471,a good space but the backyard looks like,ep111
474,it kind of just really drops yeah it,ep111
477,looks like a cliff going right over the,ep111
480,edge there right I'm really gonna have,ep111
483,to fence this in you know at 1.15,ep111
486,million that's another expense that,ep111
489,we're gonna have to add to it they go,ep111
492,back inside to see the formal dining,ep111
495,room oh this is a great dining room,ep111
498,space lots of light and this room opens,ep111
501,up to an additional space that could be,ep111
504,used as Dominic's playroom this is,ep111
507,another great room I know that Stephanie,ep111
510,wants are ready to move in house but the,ep111
513,house is not a Victorian home and it's a,ep111
516,basic colonial cookie-cutter looking at,ep111
519,parents then it's upstairs to see the,ep111
522,master bedroom and bath oh my god I'm,ep111
525,just gonna get it I'm gonna see a face,ep111
528,that I'm never gonna get you out of this,ep111
531,tub mi probably not know let's go look,ep111
534,at the master bedroom this bedroom is,ep111
537,huge and no carpeting in the bedroom all,ep111
540,hardwood this room has some character,ep111
543,and uniqueness is kind of Victorian,ep111
546,style with nooks and crannies kind of a,ep111
549,cool room did we just agree on something,ep111
552,yeah I think we did they go down the,ep111
555,hall to look at the guest bathroom and,ep111
558,three more bedrooms,ep111
561,and this could be utilized as Dominic's,ep111
564,bedroom oh it's a great space I love the,ep111
567,double closets yeah awesome I love the,ep111
570,house I love that it was all hardwood,ep111
573,floors upstairs in all of the bedrooms I,ep111
576,love the kitchen area it had my white,ep111
579,cabinetry but the house is definitely in,ep111
582,move-in condition and although it is a,ep111
585,colonial home it does have a little bit,ep111
588,of ich Torian style to it the price,ep111
591,point is a little bit higher and we have,ep111
594,to add a fence so the price point is,ep111
597,really pushing beyond the limits of what,ep111
600,I was willing to spend Thanks well the,ep111
603,next house brings the budget back down,ep111
606,the look as Stephanie worked out hi how,ep111
609,are you not that great,ep111
612,[Music],ep111
615,newlyweds Stephanie and Steven and her,ep111
618,four-year-old son Dominic are ready to,ep111
621,upsize from their cramped Boston condo,ep111
624,to a spacious house in the suburbs can,ep111
627,you go higher Dominic but Stephanie's,ep111
630,determined to get an upgraded colonial,ep111
633,even if it means breaking their 1.1,ep111
636,million dollar budget Stephen would like,ep111
639,to spend a lot less for an older,ep111
642,Victorian and doesn't mind if it needs a,ep111
645,little work,ep111
648,so far Stephanie was wowed by a new,ep111
651,colonial they saw but Stephen was turned,ep111
654,off by the price so now they're going to,ep111
657,see a house that should appeal to,ep111
660,Stephen I'm really hoping this is not,ep111
663,the house right now,ep111
666,it is a Victorian when we first walked,ep111
669,up to the house they noticed that the,ep111
672,house was a Victorian which I was happy,ep111
675,about it looks like it's two seconds,ep111
678,away from collapsing Amy where did you,ep111
681,bring us right now hi how are you not,ep111
684,that great,ep111
687,today we are in Dorchester we have a,ep111
690,beautiful Victorian home six bedrooms,ep111
693,"two and a half bathrooms 2,500 square",ep111
696,feet,ep111
699,it's listed at 550 luckily the price,ep111
702,point is way lower than budget so we,ep111
705,could put a lot of money into it to do,ep111
708,any renovations I think this house,ep111
711,really only checks things off of,ep111
714,Stephens list I know what you're,ep111
717,thinking let's uncross your arm here's,ep111
720,your grand entrance it's old yeah but we,ep111
723,can renovate it up and make it look,ep111
726,fancy in there let's move on to the,ep111
729,family room still looks pretty old to me,ep111
732,I'm not even s Victorian and that's,ep111
735,supposed to look that way and it has,ep111
738,like nooks and crannies great little,ep111
741,room you could be a Reading area in,ep111
744,there well there's a lot of space in,ep111
747,here and look what we have a,ep111
750,wood-burning fireplace okay that is,ep111
753,something that I do like and I've,ep111
756,noticed the ceilings are high mm-hmm and,ep111
759,I do like the windows in here they are,ep111
762,nice and big so they do let in a lot of,ep111
765,light it looks like you're warming up to,ep111
768,the place I wouldn't go that far I'm so,ep111
771,definitely holding out for my colonial,ep111
774,this would be your formal dining room so,ep111
777,I absolutely hate this room I hate the,ep111
780,wall color I hate the exposed radiator I,ep111
783,hate that they have this weird pole,ep111
786,going up and down the ceilings,ep111
789,but look honey there are nice paneling,ep111
792,like you like I do like seeing this that,ep111
795,is something I like I do think it brings,ep111
798,a little bit of character into the room,ep111
801,heading through a small pantry they take,ep111
804,a look at the kitchen,ep111
807,so it's a nice that dated kitchen hmm I,ep111
810,love the white countertops and the dark,ep111
813,accents I don't actually hate because of,ep111
816,the white walls yeah and I like this,ep111
819,stainless steel appliances there's,ep111
822,really nice the kitchen is really small,ep111
825,so I don't think we'd be able to put an,ep111
828,island in here either,ep111
831,yeah and it's a little bit far away from,ep111
834,the family room so if we have a party,ep111
837,and entertain everybody's gonna concrete,ep111
840,in the kitchen the other path we're,ep111
843,getting concrete in the family room and,ep111
846,it's just gonna split the party up which,ep111
849,I don't like it all right they take a,ep111
852,peek at the side yard there seems to be,ep111
855,a little bit of a side yard but I really,ep111
858,was hoping for a really big backyard it,ep111
861,just really wasn't my style at all,ep111
864,they head up to the second floor to see,ep111
867,a bathroom and three bedrooms Stephen I,ep111
870,think this room will be a great space,ep111
873,for your office,ep111
876,I agree actually I think it'll be a,ep111
879,great office space for you there's a,ep111
882,room across the hall that would be great,ep111
885,for Dominic's playroom this is nice and,ep111
888,I could totally watch Dominic playing in,ep111
891,here while I'm working in the office,ep111
894,boss the way they go up another flight,ep111
897,of stairs to the third floor to see a,ep111
900,small bedroom plus the master very,ep111
903,purple the slanted ceilings this is not,ep111
906,good,ep111
909,sooner stuff to be higher and the purple,ep111
912,is super overwhelming let's look at the,ep111
915,bathroom oh my god the slanted ceilings,ep111
918,I bumped my head every time I come in,ep111
921,here but I do actually love the antique,ep111
924,tub let's look at this room for Dominic,ep111
927,I love this room,ep111
930,yes this would be a good room for,ep111
933,Dominic it's so cute,ep111
936,[Music],ep111
939,well it is a Victorian home and I do,ep111
942,like that and the rooms had a lot of,ep111
945,personality the price is great and I,ep111
948,could give us plenty of playing room to,ep111
951,do whatever we want without but the,ep111
954,kitchen was too far away from the family,ep111
957,room and it just seemed a little bit too,ep111
960,much closed off for my liking well so,ep111
963,I'm actually really surprised there's,ep111
966,actually a lot of qualities in this,ep111
969,house that I do like I do like that all,ep111
972,the bedrooms were located upstairs so,ep111
975,that was a plus but it was an old-style,ep111
978,house it was not updated whatsoever and,ep111
981,I really don't want to deal with a very,ep111
984,intense renovation projects for the next,ep111
987,house things are tilting back towards,ep111
990,Stephanie's corner I am very excited to,ep111
993,be looking at a colonial,ep111
996,[Music],ep111
999,newlyweds Stephanie and Steven are,ep111
1002,excited to buy a spacious house in the,ep111
1005,suburbs to share with her four-year-old,ep111
1008,son Dominic miss her so much,ep111
1011,by problem is Stephanie wants an,ep111
1014,upgraded colonial style home while,ep111
1017,Steven is holding out for a Victorian,ep111
1020,that might need some work so far they've,ep111
1023,seen a brand-new colonial which,ep111
1026,Stephanie loves but with the price over,ep111
1029,their 1.1 million dollar budget Steven,ep111
1032,wasn't convinced the next house was a,ep111
1035,Victorian built in 1900 with the nooks,ep111
1038,and crannies Steven likes but it was too,ep111
1041,old for Stephanie so now they're in the,ep111
1044,suburb of Burlington to see a newer,ep111
1047,"colonial it's listed 890,000 which is",ep111
1050,within your budget we have five bedrooms,ep111
1053,one bedroom on the first floor and about,ep111
1056,"3,500 square feet oh great so right off",ep111
1059,the bat one of the things I'm not in,ep111
1062,love with is the landscape it's really,ep111
1065,busy but I am very excited to be looking,ep111
1068,at a colonial so I can't wait to see,ep111
1071,what the inside has to offer yes it is a,ep111
1074,colonial sweetheart interesting I'm not,ep111
1077,a huge fan of having half a wall in my,ep111
1080,face when I first walked through the,ep111
1083,front door maybe we could make this,ep111
1086,closet smaller so you can have your more,ep111
1089,formal grand entrance that you like even,ep111
1092,though this style home is a colonial,ep111
1095,which I love I don't want to have to,ep111
1098,deal with renovation projects that,ep111
1101,Stevens definitely willing and wanting,ep111
1104,to get into this would be the formal,ep111
1107,dining room wow this room's dark very,ep111
1110,very dark and the dark wood trim I,ep111
1113,definitely don't like that idea we'll,ep111
1116,have to paint that all-white it's dark,ep111
1119,but it is modern looking and oh my god I,ep111
1122,love these appliances the appliances are,ep111
1125,nice I definitely like them and I love,ep111
1128,the cherry cabinets I'm not a fan of,ep111
1131,dark wood anywhere I really wanted an,ep111
1134,all-white kitchen ideally with an island,ep111
1137,in the center so we can remove this,ep111
1140,table and put an island if you,ep111
1143,really want one and oh my god look that,ep111
1146,room is so open to hear the perfect for,ep111
1149,entertaining you say this room with the,ep111
1152,high ceilings Oh finally high ceilings,ep111
1155,so this house obviously wasn't a,ep111
1158,Victorian home but the great room it had,ep111
1161,high voltage ceilings which I was very,ep111
1164,excited to see did you notice the,ep111
1167,fireplace hates it and I was gonna ask,ep111
1170,you is it electric or wood burning it's,ep111
1173,wood burning I wanted a wood-burning,ep111
1176,fireplace let's go look at the backyard,ep111
1179,oh wow a swimming pool that's fabulous,ep111
1182,this is amazing yeah but I love that,ep111
1185,it's a nice white phone yeah and I love,ep111
1188,how the pool doesn't take up the whole,ep111
1191,backyard and it'll be plenty of space,ep111
1194,for Dominik and look honey there's a hot,ep111
1197,tub back inside they look at a,ep111
1200,first-floor bedroom I think this would,ep111
1203,be a great office space for you Stephen,ep111
1206,yeah actually I can put the desk bed,ep111
1209,over here read my MRIs so what do you,ep111
1212,think about this space for Dominic's,ep111
1215,playroom this is a great space I think,ep111
1218,this would actually work really well is,ep111
1221,Dominic's player yeah let's go check out,ep111
1224,the master upstairs,ep111
1227,oh my god it's wall-to-wall carpeting in,ep111
1230,there I don't like carpeting in the,ep111
1233,bedroom at all that was really high up,ep111
1236,on my list of not wanting to have so I'm,ep111
1239,not willing to rip up carpet I don't,ep111
1242,want to deal with that let's look at the,ep111
1245,master bathroom hmm it's gonna have to,ep111
1248,be redone as it's very outdated it ain't,ep111
1251,very 1990s look here's another full,ep111
1254,bathroom right here same thing as the,ep111
1257,other bathroom 1990s look it's a really,ep111
1260,good-size bathroom yeah I think we could,ep111
1263,do a lot with this they also see three,ep111
1266,additional bedrooms on the second floor,ep111
1269,it's a great space I can totally see,ep111
1272,this being Dominic's room,ep111
1275,so I love that it's a colonial it's,ep111
1278,exactly what I'm looking for in that,ep111
1281,aspect I love having the fenced-in,ep111
1284,backyard all the bedrooms are upstairs,ep111
1287,which was a huge thing for me but at the,ep111
1290,same time I also do hate the,ep111
1293,wall-to-wall carpeting,ep111
1296,my kitchen was so dark so I really don't,ep111
1299,know well I like the office space I love,ep111
1302,the kitchen,ep111
1305,I like the cherry wood cabinets and I,ep111
1308,love the great room how it was connected,ep111
1311,to the kitchen and the entertaining the,ep111
1314,purposes dislikes I wanted something,ep111
1317,more of a Victorian with funky rooms,ep111
1320,because it did kind of look a little bit,ep111
1323,cookie cutter but the great room kind of,ep111
1326,saved that from being not as unique none,ep111
1329,of the homes hit all the marks so,ep111
1332,Stephanie and Steven have to weigh,ep111
1335,what's most important an open kitchen,ep111
1338,hardwood throughout or a fenced-in,ep111
1341,backyard I know at home I want I know at,ep111
1344,home I want,ep111
1347,Steven and Stephanie are looking to move,ep111
1350,out of a cramped Boston condo and into a,ep111
1353,spacious new hallway with a budget of,ep111
1356,1.1 million dollars it's time to decide,ep111
1359,priced at 1.15 million the first option,ep111
1362,is a new home in Lynn field,ep111
1365,I loved that new construction home,ep111
1368,I know it's over budget but like way,ep111
1371,over budget it's a gorgeous entryway,ep111
1374,hardwood floors all throughout the,ep111
1377,kitchen was amazing and the backyard was,ep111
1380,big but we would also have to put a,ep111
1383,fence around the yard and I wasn't,ep111
1386,comfortable with which room would be my,ep111
1389,office I just thought it was great I,ep111
1392,definitely think it's worth it the turn,ep111
1395,of the century Victorian and Dorchester,ep111
1398,is the least expensive at five hundred,ep111
1401,and fifty thousand dollars well you know,ep111
1404,I love Victorian and I loved all the,ep111
1407,funky rooms and nooks and crannies in,ep111
1410,the house and although the price was,ep111
1413,amazing just thought there was a lot of,ep111
1416,work to do the kitchen is really nicely,ep111
1419,updated and there were no carpets in the,ep111
1422,bedroom but there really was no backyard,ep111
1425,then there's a newer colonial in,ep111
1428,Burlington for eight hundred and ninety,ep111
1431,thousand dollars I did like it for a,ep111
1434,colonial the yard is amazing it is,ep111
1437,cookie cutter shape but it did have a,ep111
1440,lot of character and I did love the,ep111
1443,great room in the kitchen that house,ep111
1446,also needs a lot of work too like we,ep111
1449,didn't like the landscaping and we would,ep111
1452,need to literally paint every single,ep111
1455,room in there but does have the four,ep111
1458,bedrooms upstairs I do hate though that,ep111
1461,all the bedrooms have carpeting in it,ep111
1464,[Music],ep111
1467,which one do you think is the better,ep111
1470,purchase the colonial home in Burlington,ep111
1473,is my choice because I love the great,ep111
1476,room and it's in the middle of our price,ep111
1479,point I actually do agree with you,ep111
1482,because it just had all the space that,ep111
1485,we were looking for I just see a lot,ep111
1488,more potential in that home then I do,ep111
1491,with any other let's go call you me,ep111
1494,excellent we actually just moved in,ep111
1497,three days ago so we're still definitely,ep111
1500,moving a lot of our stuff in rearranging,ep111
1503,everything but it's been a lot of fun I,ep111
1506,did settle for the colonial home which,ep111
1509,my wife loves but I feel this home that,ep111
1512,we chose has enough character and I'm,ep111
1515,really excited about being in my new,ep111
1518,office and I can actually have my own,ep111
1521,space I would have preferred a more,ep111
1524,updated lighter version of this but it,ep111
1527,does allow Stephen a project and he,ep111
1530,likes having things like that to do I'm,ep111
1533,excited about starting my renovation,ep111
1536,projects working on the landscape in the,ep111
1539,yard this house really offered all the,ep111
1542,space that we were looking for in,ep111
1545,stammen Akkad his play area do you like,ep111
1548,in your bedroom and don't forget about,ep111
1551,that great backyard,ep111
1554,we're really excited about the future in,ep111
1557,our new home very excited,ep111
12,I'm almost crying this whole area,ep112
15,Anthony and Cathy are trading in their,ep112
18,hard charging work lives in Fullerton,ep112
21,California for the sun-soaked Beach Isis,ep112
24,of Puerto Vallarta Mexico but they're on,ep112
27,completely opposite ends of the divide,ep112
30,when it comes to just about everything I,ep112
33,love the beach,ep112
36,I want that sunset coming in our window,ep112
39,for me the beach is not that important,ep112
42,now how could that be this is a tropical,ep112
45,paradise I'd like to see something with,ep112
48,more of a jungle feel they're totally on,ep112
51,the opposite ends of the spectrum which,ep112
54,could mean their futures up for grabs I,ep112
57,want to feel like I'm moving to Mexico,ep112
60,this is exactly what I'm looking for,ep112
63,this is the first time a couple that,ep112
66,brought a dog along for the property,ep112
69,tour yeah why not,ep112
72,if all else fails I'm just gonna have to,ep112
75,negotiate with pup oh what a mess that,ep112
78,would be huh,ep112
81,[Music],ep112
84,where I want you to go get that big,ep112
87,tattoo okay sounds good,ep112
90,this does I love Mexico,ep112

96,kids we have Nicolas who's 19 and we,ep112
99,have Paige who is 17 wait where's my,ep112

129,26 years I can walk away from it our,ep112
132,first vacation trip to Puerto Vallarta,ep112
135,was a major turning point in us starting,ep112
138,to think that gosh we could do this we,ep112
141,could go down there as a permanent,ep112
144,transition it's gonna be an opportunity,ep112
147,for us to connect you think you might be,ep112
150,able to find something that's gonna work,ep112
153,for the dog no totally our dog pup is,ep112
156,like a third child to us and she goes,ep112
159,everywhere with me I think we better,ep112
162,take the dog on the house hunt as well,ep112
165,we need her opinion and we just love her,ep112
168,her opinion yeah really not who brings a,ep112
171,dog for shopping New Mexico to look at,ep112
174,condos wait you they're gonna think,ep112
177,they're crazy,ep112
180,yeah we are this is a giant part of our,ep112
183,lifetime savings invested in this,ep112
186,commitment and it's a one-shot deal to,ep112
189,go down there and do this but he's,ep112
192,worked so hard our whole lives and,ep112
195,we need this where Toby artha is a,ep112
198,"resort town of 250,000 people on",ep112
201,Mexico's Pacific coast famous for its,ep112
204,beaches laid-back lifestyle and historic,ep112
207,Mexican char,ep112
210,[Music],ep112
213,porta viar-toe kind of feels like,ep112
216,old-world Europe at times you've got a,ep112
219,mixture of homes and commercial like,ep112
222,mixed usage neighborhoods,ep112
225,you've got the mountains the jungle the,ep112
228,river and the beach so it's not,ep112
231,something you would calmly encounter in,ep112
234,the United States this is pop and she's,ep112
237,my girl she comes with us everywhere,ep112
240,cool until what kind of houses are you,ep112
243,guys looking for too bad too bad mm-hmm,ep112
246,I love the beach the sand I want that,ep112
249,sunset coming in our window for me the,ep112
252,beach is not so important I'd like to,ep112
255,see something with more of a jungle feel,ep112
258,and in terms of architectural style my,ep112
261,traditional if I'm gonna be in Mexico I,ep112
264,want it to look like Mexico okay I'm,ep112
267,thinking maybe a little more modern,ep112
270,sleek brand-new appliances how much are,ep112
273,you think I'm spending we want to cap,ep112
276,this out at five hundred and fifty,ep112
279,thousand I wouldn't mind singing,ep112
282,something a little over five hundred and,ep112
285,fifty I like that they're totally on the,ep112
288,opposite ends of the spectrum,ep112
291,besides I'm agreeing on two bedrooms two,ep112
294,baths everything else is just like up in,ep112
297,the air I'm choosing this property,ep112
300,because it's beachfront it's got that,ep112
303,modern element to it for Anthony but,ep112
306,there are elements of the old-world,ep112
309,Mexican charm so I'm hoping that's,ep112
312,enough for Cathy to cinch the deal the,ep112
315,home I'm going to show you right now is,ep112
318,three bedrooms or bads,ep112
321,that's right on the beach I like that,ep112
324,how much is it,ep112
327,Anthony cover your ears okay it's,ep112
330,"575,000 I don't like that in my opinion",ep112
333,"$25,000 is not that much money",ep112
336,well if that view is not calling you I,ep112
339,don't know what please what do you think,ep112
342,that is amazing cool space that ocean,ep112
345,view out the front is killer well I,ep112
348,think Papa likes the place we're gonna,ep112
351,make you a martini and we'll be right,ep112
354,back I want you to check this kitchen,ep112
357,out got the brand-new stainless-steel,ep112
360,appliances got the electric cooktop I,ep112
363,was looking for something a little more,ep112
366,Mexico when it's,ep112
369,a little less modern modern I want to,ep112
372,feel like I'm moving New Mexico not like,ep112
375,I'm moving to Fullerton California this,ep112
378,is exactly what I'm looking for,ep112
381,state of the art appliance it's all nice,ep112
384,brand-new and Slater this comes at a,ep112
387,premium but it's awfully nice yeah this,ep112
390,is not something you get typically oh my,ep112
393,goodness so green condos don't normally,ep112
396,have this here the ocean from here even,ep112
399,you consider the ocean and Kathy you,ep112
402,know like in the front the house is more,ep112
405,moderate but is this old-world enough,ep112
408,for you I love it the courtyard makes me,ep112
411,feel like I am in Mexico I just wish the,ep112
414,house embraced more of the courtyard,ep112
417,throughout this is the master bedroom I,ep112
420,like the color and you have direct,ep112
423,access from the bedroom to the terrace,ep112
426,it's amazing it's amazing but it's a,ep112
429,little more expensive than we want to go,ep112
432,now this is all mine right oh wow yeah,ep112
435,killer ocean view got a wonderful,ep112
438,terrace over here direct access to come,ep112
441,down to the pool this whole open front,ep112
444,here with the ocean yeah all right it's,ep112
447,what I had in mind,ep112
450,so are you guys ready to sign on the,ep112
453,dotted line this is exactly what I'm,ep112
456,looking for it's sleek and modern and,ep112
459,newly redone,ep112
462,price is high I'm not sure I want to,ep112
465,"spend an extra $25,000 I'm okay with it",ep112
468,being a little a little more money but,ep112
471,for me the beach is not that important,ep112
474,with the exception of the courtyard if,ep112
477,those are a little too modern to me,ep112
480,I really would be okay with it being a,ep112
483,little bit higher up to the mountains,ep112
486,okay and I'd like to make sure that we,ep112
489,can keep the price where we need it to,ep112
492,be if all else fails I'm just gonna have,ep112
495,to negotiate with Puff Girls well you,ep112
498,want an old-world Mexico and here you,ep112
501,have it this house is for Cathy more,ep112
504,than Anthony,ep112
507,oh this is it I don't want to work on,ep112
510,anything I don't want to maintain a pool,ep112
513,and I'm done with that it's my turn to,ep112
516,see some traditional and this really,ep112
519,fits the belt it's one thing to drive in,ep112
522,Mexico it's another one to have ATVs,ep112
525,pull the street Cathy is pushing Anthony,ep112
528,to leave his staid California existence,ep112
531,behind and embrace the laid-back,ep112
534,lifestyle word of I act uh it's famous,ep112
537,boy I own a fine company and after 26,ep112
540,years I can walk away from it you're,ep112
543,gonna help me decide and learn how to do,ep112
546,the color change on this I'd like my son,ep112
549,to step into the business and completely,ep112
552,take over where I step out he can just,ep112
555,fill my shoes and keep it going boy,ep112
558,Cathy's a good balance for me she keeps,ep112
561,me lightened up a bit this really is a,ep112
564,dream for me this is Sony,ep112
567,but you're kind of going fast when Kathy,ep112
570,and I disagree she's more on an,ep112
573,emotional level and then I'm on the,ep112
576,other end of the spectrum with my bullet,ep112
579,point list of here's the reasons why I,ep112
582,should win this argument,ep112
585,[Music],ep112
588,a little faster than I think I think,ep112
591,with my heart and he thinks with his,ep112
594,head and that's especially true when it,ep112
597,"comes to house 1 ok it's 575,000 I don't",ep112
600,like that pop and Cathy don't care about,ep112
603,"$25,000 well I want to scale down a",ep112
606,little bit if that view is not calling,ep112
609,you I don't know what please and the dog,ep112
612,I think you just want to go to sleep,ep112
615,right now this comes at a premium but,ep112
618,it's awfully nice,ep112
621,you know theny says that he is the saver,ep112
624,and that I'm the spender I'm ok with it,ep112
627,being a little a little more money,ep112
630,that's right it's the truth I was,ep112
633,looking for something a little more,ep112
636,Mexico I just want to see some different,ep112
639,things some different options something,ep112
642,in the mountains for me the beach is not,ep112
645,that important now how could that be,ep112
648,this is a tropical paradise Cathy I butt,ep112
651,heads a bit because we're opposites,ep112
654,we're totally opposites I'm gonna take,ep112
657,you off into the rough dirt Erica no,ep112
660,dirt so yes it's part of the magic and,ep112
663,what makes it fun and interesting for us,ep112
666,but it always works out Ian Anthony,ep112
669,might seem like they're polar opposites,ep112
672,but obviously after 20 years of marriage,ep112
675,there must be some form of a glue that's,ep112
678,sticking them together are you ready to,ep112
681,go a little further I'm ready to go,ep112
684,let's do it this house is for Cathy more,ep112
687,than Anthony old-world warm tones and,ep112
690,painted tile in the jungle that's,ep112
693,traditional that's burrata and that's,ep112
696,what Cathy wants well you wanted,ep112
699,old-world Mexico and here you have it,ep112
702,you know with the cobblestone streets,ep112
705,the jungle setting it's just like home,ep112
708,the house I'm gonna show you right now,ep112
711,it's a two-bedroom three-bath and it's,ep112
714,"only priced at $475,000 ah this is",ep112

813,this room that's all you're trying to,ep112
816,avoid else the place makes me feel like,ep112
819,I am in Mexico California is a disc,ep112
822,memory the price can't beat it this is,ep112
825,true but I see a few problems I'm more,ep112
828,of a modern guy I want modern clean and,ep112
831,sleek I'm just not sold on the fact that,ep112
834,it's gonna be something I don't have to,ep112

864,mess that would be hot hope you like,ep112
867,this place yes I do this house is a wild,ep112
870,card I don't know what's gonna happen I,ep112
873,know Anthony wants to downsize but for,ep112
876,me this place seems a little bit small,ep112
879,oh my this is not good,ep112
882,she just blurts out I don't like this I,ep112
885,don't like that I don't want to see,ep112
888,anything modern I don't need that,ep112
891,have you ever done pottery before never,ep112
894,Anthony is the hardest-working person,ep112
897,that I know I've been quite a workaholic,ep112
900,for about 26 years it definitely would,ep112
903,not be doing this and we're not at the,ep112
906,time exactly,ep112
909,you can get phone calls in the middle of,ep112

915,how it happens we have sine emergencies,ep112
918,just floor that gas pedal no just a,ep112
921,little everything settled in pottery,ep112
924,just a little bit fly fly we really need,ep112
927,this time together,ep112
930,we need to be done from California it's,ep112
933,time oh Sh in front is real important to,ep112

939,front door and be on the sand if that,ep112
942,view is not calling you I don't know,ep112
945,what please this comes at a premium but,ep112
948,it's awfully nice yeah I really would be,ep112
951,okay with it being a little bit higher,ep112
954,up for the mountains okay talk about,ep112
957,personalities this is the first time a,ep112

972,it,ep112
975,I'm gonna be taking care of this all the,ep112
978,time,ep112
981,this is new well in it no ish I think,ep112

993,this place please please,ep112
996,this house is a wild card I don't know,ep112
999,what's gonna happen it's brand-new,ep112
1002,barely a year old,ep112
1005,it's beachfront adjacent it's got some,ep112
1008,old-world elements to it which i think,ep112
1011,is gonna appeal to Cathy,ep112
1014,but being modern and new I think is an,ep112
1017,appeal to Anthony to the pop I'm going,ep112
1020,to show you right now it's a two-bedroom,ep112
1023,two-bath and it's priced at open at,ep112
1026,"50,000 what you want the homes over here",ep112
1029,they're about 30-40 years old so it's an,ep112
1032,old-world Mexico that you like it feels,ep112
1035,really like we're in Mexico yeah like,ep112
1038,that you got the ocean right there you,ep112
1041,can hear the waters breaking on the raw,ep112
1044,I love that you can see God like don't,ep112
1047,work and it leads right up to your unit,ep112
1050,Daniel yeah little noise yeah that's the,ep112
1053,a/c compressor on the balcony those air,ep112
1056,conditioning units and back,ep112
1059,they are loud and they're unsightly,ep112
1062,first thing you see oh my god this is,ep112
1065,beautiful oh wow struck did Ocean View,ep112
1068,I'm noticing that there's no formal,ep112
1071,dining room and I see seating out there,ep112
1074,on the terrace is that where we're,ep112
1077,supposed to eat yeah bye Eric that,ep112
1080,people want to be outdoors all the time,ep112
1083,of course with the views of the ocean I,ep112
1086,mean that's where you want to be most of,ep112
1089,the time anyways right I know Anthony,ep112
1092,wants to downsize but for me this place,ep112
1095,seems a little bit small yeah I don't,ep112
1098,care about the formal dining area I,ep112
1101,don't need that and how do you think pop,ep112
1104,feels yeah she's already relaxed the big,ep112
1107,kitchen of the island is huge I like all,ep112
1110,these nice new modern appliances it's so,ep112
1113,clean and open this is a strange place,ep112
1116,for a microwave don't you think it's a,ep112
1119,little low yes somebody who doesn't cook,ep112
1122,design this kitchen absolutely who would,ep112
1125,put in microwave underneath the counter,ep112
1128,guys I really love this bedroom and what,ep112
1131,they've done to it,ep112
1134,this is really cool oh my gosh look at,ep112
1137,that that's what I'm talking about I,ep112
1140,love that that is so traditional and,ep112
1143,yeah beautiful that's nice and rustic,ep112
1146,you like no love it,ep112
1149,maybe a little too rustic for me not,ep112
1152,sure I'm okay with out here let's go out,ep112
1155,here oh my this is not good it is a,ep112
1158,little noisy yeah we got a hotel next,ep112
1161,door you've got the restaurant and,ep112
1164,people by the pool I do not like that I,ep112
1167,have to talk to my neighbors and I do,ep112
1170,not like that I have to look at the air,ep112
1173,conditioning units at all right there,ep112
1176,and right there I can see those people,ep112
1179,and those people Kathy likes to be in,ep112
1182,charge yeah I can see them and,ep112
1185,and they can see us Cathy's got way too,ep112
1188,much personality,ep112
1191,it's a mix this has a mix of feelings in,ep112
1194,this place it's clean and modern that's,ep112
1197,for me the bedroom in the back maybe not,ep112
1200,so much I love how the master bedroom is,ep112
1203,very traditional and on this one the,ep112
1206,price is right but I am not in love with,ep112
1209,this balcony I do not like having to,ep112
1212,look over at my neighbors and seeing the,ep112
1215,pool next door,ep112
1218,this place is about 70 percent modern,ep112
1221,and 30% traditional and I would really,ep112
1224,like to see that reversed I don't want,ep112
1227,to see anything modern it's very hard to,ep112
1230,find an apartment that it's absolutely,ep112
1233,100% perfect in every aspect of the word,ep112
1236,you want to grab pepper can I come on,ep112
1239,baby,ep112
1242,Daniels good he can handle it exactly,ep112
1245,Daniels it to work did we work this long,ep112
1248,to compromise and work harder I don't,ep112
1251,want to settle or something that I don't,ep112
1254,want,ep112
1257,[Music],ep112
1260,so this is kind of a nice outdoorsy,ep112
1263,jungle feel like you like this is very,ep112
1266,very jungle II Anthony and Cathy are,ep112
1269,looking to ditch their grinding work,ep112
1272,life in California and reinvent,ep112
1275,themselves in the beachside paradise of,ep112
1278,Puerto Vallarta Mexico it's gonna be an,ep112
1281,opportunity for us to spend more time,ep112
1284,together and for us to connect but,ep112
1287,Anthony wants turnkey and modern on the,ep112
1290,water I've been quite a workaholic I,ep112
1293,don't want to do anything that relax,ep112
1296,while Kathy set on a place with,ep112
1299,traditional Mexican style right next to,ep112
1302,the jungle we have a view of the beach,ep112
1305,but we're not on the beach that for sure,ep112
1308,deal-breaker here on that for me the one,ep112
1311,that's down on the beach I mean it's,ep112
1314,cool sand waves you can't beat that,ep112
1317,this whole open front here with the,ep112
1320,ocean it's what I had in mind but it's a,ep112
1323,little more expensive than we want to go,ep112
1326,it's no secret that I want traditional,ep112
1329,with the exception of the courtyard it's,ep112
1332,a little too modern to me I love the,ep112
1335,jungle house,ep112
1338,I really like the terracotta tiles what,ep112
1341,I think I'm moving to Puerto Verta,ep112
1344,this is exactly what I think of but this,ep112
1347,really isn't my style all I think is,ep112
1350,older cracks wear-and-tear I've done,ep112
1353,with maintaining stuff you know the one,ep112
1356,that's kind of a high-rise that speaks,ep112
1359,it's me that says do nothing come down,ep112
1362,here,ep112
1365,have a cocktail unobstructed ocean view,ep112
1368,company we don't like neighbors oh my,ep112
1371,this is not good I can see those people,ep112
1374,and those people,ep112
1377,[Music],ep112
1380,well I really would be okay not taking,ep112
1383,the beach house the beach house didn't,ep112
1386,have enough traditional touches for you,ep112
1389,and well over what we would spend I,ep112
1392,really want to live in the mountains,ep112
1395,modern architecture modern building it's,ep112
1398,just more my style you know that the,ep112
1401,jungle house being so much less,ep112
1404,expensive I'm surprised you're not just,ep112
1407,jumping on that I like that you got me,ep112
1410,there but I'm not close enough to the,ep112
1413,sand I want to be able to walk out and,ep112
1416,walk onto the beach stepping into that,ep112
1419,house makes me feel like I am in Port,ep112
1422,America,ep112
1425,you know they had like vines and plants,ep112
1428,growing inside that fits what you wanted,ep112
1431,but did we work this long to compromise,ep112
1434,and work harder all that older stuff,ep112
1437,maybe means a little bit of maintenance,ep112
1440,I don't want to settle for something,ep112
1443,that I don't want in truth the highrise,ep112
1446,speaks to me I could just sit there,ep112
1449,relax enjoy the view I would love that I,ep112
1452,do love the jungle house however it is,ep112
1455,very important to me that you are able,ep112
1458,to stop working and I don't mean just,ep112
1461,stop working in California I mean stop,ep112
1464,working completely thank you I won't,ep112
1467,call in the back patio and then,ep112
1470,everybody's happy oh I'm happy oh good,ep112
1473,Pub happy high-rise it is,ep112
1476,[Music],ep112
1479,it's really a 120 second stroll to the,ep112
1482,most beautiful sandy beach in all of her,ep112
1485,Derrida in my opinion I have totally,ep112
1488,changed my priorities here how can there,ep112
1491,be so many perfect days in a row I've,ep112
1494,been able to unplug since we've been,ep112
1497,down here getting rid of all this stuff,ep112
1500,the clutter that was weighing me down,ep112
1503,now I feel like I'm free and relaxed,ep112
1506,down here with Cathy and the dog so we,ep112
1509,don't need to make a plan no this is the,ep112
1512,plan it's the plan the plan is no plan I,ep112
1515,never thought that I would ever be able,ep112
1518,to to do this so it's been a good team,ep112
1521,and worked hard for a long time we just,ep112
1524,pulled a brave move that's all and it's,ep112
1527,working,ep112
1530,[Music],ep112
12,oh wow man this place has definitely,ep113
15,been updated these best friends both,ep113
18,named Emily it's confusing for us to are,ep113
21,buying a house together in Austin Texas,ep113
24,but they have completely opposite styles,ep113
27,it's really cute I like the cottage,ep113
30,style it's definitely not mid-century,ep113
33,modern which doesn't please me and,ep113
36,vastly different feelings on renovating,ep113
39,this is nasty do you think it has a lot,ep113
42,of potential it's just a little bit of,ep113
45,work we could make this really cute a,ep113
48,little bit of work their house hunt and,ep113
51,their friendship hang in the balance a,ep113
54,little workshop woodshop hey this looks,ep113
57,like a jail,ep113
60,I love the closets having two is perfect,ep113
63,for me I don't like the implication that,ep113
66,that makes it your room though so that's,ep113
69,a problem,ep113
72,[Music],ep113
75,I can't believe this is just in the,ep113
78,middle of the city I know I don't even,ep113
81,feel like I'm in Austin I'm Emily and,ep113
84,I'm Emily it's confusing for us too,ep113
87,yeah we call each other em but for other,ep113
90,people we ask that they call us MO and,ep113
93,MV because when someone just shouts out,ep113
96,Emily and yet he'll turn it cuz it very,ep113
99,alone I'm a market research director,ep113
102,here in Austin I'm a software engineer,ep113
105,and I'm starting my own online vintage,ep113
108,clothing business I ever tell you you,ep113
111,used to raise ducks,ep113
114,Lisa raised us yeah Wow I smelled,ep113
117,exactly like this we're best friends we,ep113
120,met about six years ago here in Austin,ep113
123,but then not too long after Emily moved,ep113
126,to New York so I was like well she's,ep113
129,gonna go visit her and see what happens,ep113
132,and somehow we still managed to do so,ep113
135,glad to have you back in town yeah this,ep113
138,weather is amazing and now these friends,ep113
141,are ready to transition from being,ep113
144,renters to buyers but they've decided to,ep113
147,buy a house together since they can get,ep113
150,more bang for their buck if they pool,ep113
153,their resources we've both really always,ep113
156,just wanted to own property in Austin we,ep113
159,really wanted to put our savings into,ep113
162,something that is gonna you know have a,ep113
165,return on investment for us our budget,ep113
168,is 275 and that would be for a more,ep113
171,move-in-ready house that we wouldn't,ep113
174,have to make any major changes on,ep113
177,although they agree on budget they're,ep113
180,polar opposites when it comes to style I,ep113
183,love the statement door that's painted,ep113
186,Orange the geometric lines the Palm,ep113
189,Springs mid-century modern vibe is,ep113
192,perfect I really prefer something more,ep113
195,mid-century modern I prefer a little bit,ep113
198,more straight lines and having that open,ep113
201,floor plan I definitely wouldn't go for,ep113
204,that color but I like the style of that,ep113
207,little cottage home I am really looking,ep113
210,for a bungalow cottage type home I,ep113
213,really like the cozy homey feel ideally,ep113
216,we're looking for a two-bedroom house,ep113
219,with two fairly equally sized bedrooms,ep113
222,and two bathrooms yeah because we cannot,ep113
225,share,ep113
228,this is super cool I love the embroidery,ep113
231,yeah it's really vivid I'm starting a,ep113
234,vintage clothing business and I've been,ep113
237,collecting vintage for the past maybe 10,ep113
240,years ideally I love it have a home,ep113
243,office because I do spend all of my time,ep113
246,working from home I really love board,ep113
249,working and an ideal space would be a,ep113
252,pretty sizable shed with power if it had,ep113
255,AC they also don't agree on how much,ep113
258,renovation they're willing to take on I,ep113
261,would really like to find a project I've,ep113
264,done tile work of refinishing floors,ep113
267,painting wallpapering and I don't really,ep113
270,have any of those skills em got me in,ep113
273,the shop one time and helps you make a,ep113
276,cutting board and that went medium bad,ep113
279,so I mean something that's a little bit,ep113
282,closer to move-in-ready would be a lot,ep113
285,more ideal for me it's pretty crazy to,ep113
288,think that we might actually be,ep113
291,homeowners,ep113
294,I know yeah it's really nuts and Emma,ep113
297,levy would like to stay close to Austin,ep113
300,City Center to keep her commute time,ep113
303,short now that were in our late 20s I,ep113
306,think that it's pretty common in hitting,ep113
309,this age that you start to I don't know,ep113
312,like suddenly you're like jolted into,ep113
315,reality like what are you doing with,ep113
318,your life and so that definitely hit,ep113
321,both of us very hard in the last year or,ep113
324,so and I think that motivated us to get,ep113
327,moving or things yeah we're ready to buy,ep113
330,a house first up is a house in East,ep113
333,Austin that's about seven miles from,ep113
336,downtown and it's closer to Emma Levy's,ep113
339,style so I brought you to this cottage,ep113
342,style house it's a three-bedroom,ep113
345,"two-bath it's a little over 1,300 square",ep113
348,feet listed for 225 where are we we're,ep113
351,in East Austin are you sure I assure you,ep113
354,we're still in East Austin okay we'll,ep113
357,take your word okay it's almost,ep113
360,impossible to find something that they,ep113
363,want with all the criteria within the,ep113
366,budget that's very close to the city,ep113
369,it's really cute I like the cottage,ep113
372,style I like the size of it it's,ep113
375,definitely not mid-century modern which,ep113
378,doesn't please me and there's a driveway,ep113
381,that leads to nowhere right now well it,ep113
384,leads to the bedroom boys,ep113
387,[Music],ep113
390,ladies this has definitely been like,ep113
393,updated but it has with terrible choices,ep113
396,then floorplan is nice that it's open,ep113
399,but and it's open but it doesn't feel,ep113
402,too overwhelming I think that the,ep113
405,floorplan actually marries my cottage,ep113
408,vibe and Emily's want for an open floor,ep113
411,plan really nicely,ep113
414,I thought the drive up better that's the,ep113
417,drive it is a decently sized room it's,ep113
420,really great that they have those,ep113
423,windows like perfectly positioned to,ep113
426,yeah just come straight there a closet,ep113
429,is in the master bath okay this is,ep113
432,strange,ep113
435,yeah let's shower is like framed like a,ep113
438,picture yeah just crawl in and take off,ep113
441,[Laughter],ep113
444,[Music],ep113
447,chamber I don't know all right I like,ep113
450,the flow of the living room into the,ep113
453,kitchen I do like the layout of the,ep113
456,kitchen but these finishes yeah I don't,ep113
459,like the backsplash at all right like,ep113
462,articularly over here with the white,ep113
465,outline - yeah quirky I'll put it that's,ep113
468,different for sure I did want something,ep113
471,that is less of a total fixer-upper but,ep113
474,they fix this one up in a way that is,ep113
477,just disturbing to me well it's big yeah,ep113
480,so let's face there's not an existing,ep113
483,workshop or shed but we could probably,ep113
486,really pretty easily put that in okay,ep113
489,they check out the second bedroom but I,ep113
492,definitely wouldn't want this as my,ep113
495,bedroom but maybe more as an office yeah,ep113
498,that could work and the guest bath it's,ep113
501,a good size and I really love this tile,ep113
504,floor let's look at the final bedroom,ep113
507,that's the biggest one of them all this,ep113
510,room has a really nice vibe to it I like,ep113
513,the big window the natural light this is,ep113
516,a good room so we're gonna be fighting,ep113
519,over this yeah,ep113
522,I did like the cottage style of the home,ep113
525,I think the number of bedrooms is really,ep113
528,good the number of bathrooms is what,ep113
531,we're looking for but I think the,ep113
534,location is absolutely horrible yeah I,ep113
537,feel conflicted because it is nice that,ep113
540,there's enough space for me to have an,ep113
543,office but the debate over who's gonna,ep113
546,get which of the two masters and whose,ep113
549,can live in the drive-up room that's,ep113
552,gonna cause problems between us so we,ep113
555,want to remain friends so now to keep,ep113
558,the peace there agent ray finds a home,ep113
561,that's more Emily o style this is still,ep113
564,really far out for me,ep113
567,how about this one oh I like it I'll try,ep113
570,it on,ep113
573,best friends with the same first name,ep113
576,Emily V and Emily oh are pooling their,ep113
579,resources to buy a home together in,ep113
582,Austin Texas I think that looks great,ep113
585,just kind of cool it's nice that it,ep113
588,floats away from the body - so far,ep113
591,they've seen an updated cottage that was,ep113
594,under their 275 thousand dollar budget,ep113
597,it had dual masters and room for an,ep113
600,office but it was a little far from,ep113
603,downtown and was not the style Emily,ep113
606,wants so now their agent is showing them,ep113
609,a house that's about 10 minutes from,ep113
612,downtown and leans more towards Emily Oh,ep113
615,style today I brought you to this,ep113
618,mid-century modern built in 1971 it's,ep113
621,"just under 1,400 square feet four",ep113
624,bedrooms two baths and it's listed for,ep113
627,"$285,000 well it's above budget it is",ep113
630,above budget but it's completely,ep113
633,rehabbed turnkey ready to go I do like,ep113
636,that it's more mid-century modern,ep113
639,leaning the lines of it are nice and,ep113
642,geometric this is still really far out,ep113
645,for me,ep113
648,so that house is gonna have to be really,ep113
651,incredible inside to convince me to go,ep113
654,over budget and outside of where I want,ep113
657,to be Windsor Hills is a really cool,ep113
660,neighborhood it's up-and-coming I could,ep113
663,see them really setting their roots here,ep113
666,and grow it into the neighborhood come,ep113
669,on in ladies,ep113
672,Wow man this place has definitely been,ep113
675,updated I can easily see how this could,ep113
678,lend itself to mid-century modern I can,ep113
681,see why ray brought us here it has those,ep113
684,lines I've been asking for the bones and,ep113
687,the structure of the house is just what,ep113
690,I'm looking for I don't even mind the,ep113
693,openness of this cuz it still feels,ep113
696,small enough to feel cohesive I will say,ep113
699,the layout of this kitchen is perfect,ep113
702,it has great space for both of us to be,ep113
705,in here and like everything is new as,ep113
708,far as appliances the dishwasher the,ep113
711,stove I can totally see it eating,ep113
714,breakfast here yeah who gets a nice view,ep113
717,of the air,ep113
720,ladies let's check out this awesome,ep113
723,backyard and Emily I have a surprise for,ep113
726,you after you,ep113
729,oh wow this is cute out here I do like,ep113
732,that it's covered you ready for your,ep113
735,surprise oh yeah okay follow me look at,ep113
738,this a little workshop woodshop hey this,ep113
741,looks like a jail come on in alright I,ep113
744,don't know about that,ep113
747,this is the first of the four bedrooms,ep113
750,you can see it's being used as an office,ep113
753,it's definitely too small to be a full,ep113
756,bedroom but yeah it would work for an,ep113
759,office for me they look at the second,ep113
762,bedroom and guest bath it's very great,ep113
765,it's updated which is nice,ep113
768,and third bedroom you've got kind of,ep113
771,that bonus cut out well sir the master,ep113
774,suite is next door this is really nice,ep113
777,now we're talking nice right yeah yeah I,ep113
780,don't know the closets there's two of,ep113
783,them and having two is perfect for me I,ep113
786,don't like the implication that that,ep113
789,makes it your room though so that's a,ep113
792,problem I'm not saying anything this is,ep113
795,a nice-sized bathroom yeah this is great,ep113
798,this tile is just so cute I wish they,ep113
801,had done more of it in here yeah I also,ep113
804,like that this lever so low it's perfect,ep113
807,ideally I would get the master bedroom,ep113
810,with the two closets together but then,ep113
813,also having the office I mean Emily does,ep113
816,get that really awesome shed that Ray,ep113
819,surprised through it but I don't know,ep113
822,how that's gonna go for our friendship,ep113
825,I like a lot of the updates that they've,ep113
828,done but there's definitely some,ep113
831,challenges,ep113
834,there's no shed except for that tiny,ep113
837,jail out back we're over budget,ep113
840,style-wise this place is great and this,ep113
843,really fitting in that mid-century,ep113
846,modern vibe that I like space wise I'm,ep113
849,not sure how we would divide up the,ep113
852,space but there's a lot of it yeah so,ep113
855,that's a plus I would really like to see,ep113
858,something that has a little bit more of,ep113
861,a project aspect to it I'd really like,ep113
864,to do some of our own renovations in,ep113
867,this process sorry about that,ep113
870,he'll be fine so their agent lines up a,ep113
873,fixer-upper for Emily V but Emily O has,ep113
876,her doubts but this looks like a mess,ep113
879,it's gonna need some love,ep113
882,[Music],ep113
885,all right can you step a little bit,ep113
888,towards me so I can get a little bit of,ep113
891,action the colors are popping a lot,ep113
894,that's great best friends Emily V and,ep113
897,Emily O are looking to buy their first,ep113
900,home together as 5050 partners in Austin,ep113
903,Texas but finding something close to,ep113
906,Austin city center within their 275,ep113
909,thousand dollar budget that fits their,ep113
912,vastly different tastes has been a,ep113
915,challenge so far they've seen an updated,ep113
918,cottage that has two equal sized,ep113
921,bedrooms and room for Emily O's home,ep113
924,vintage business but one bedroom has,ep113
927,windows that face the driveway and,ep113
930,there's no backyard shed for Emily V's,ep113
933,woodworking next they saw a turnkey,ep113
936,mid-century modern that appealed to,ep113
939,Emily o style but it only had one master,ep113
942,suite was over budget and was far from,ep113
945,the city center so today their agents,ep113
948,showing them a place that's close to,ep113
951,downtown this is a four-bedroom one-bath,ep113
954,bungalow 1224 square feet and it's,ep113
957,listed for 235 thousand dollars I know,ep113
960,that's under your budget,ep113
963,and you're really close to downtown,ep113
966,today I'm showing the Emily something,ep113
969,that they can afford within the city,ep113
972,limits,ep113
975,it's a good location you know it's a,ep113
978,straight shot to downtown well location,ep113
981,is good but this looks like a mess it's,ep113
984,gonna need some love my first impression,ep113
987,of this house is that it's a huge scary,ep113
990,project and I definitely don't want a,ep113
993,project I think it has a lot of,ep113
996,potential I do know that the seller is,ep113
999,highly motivated they stop mid,ep113
1002,renovation so that could be your game,ep113
1005,it's so small and it definitely doesn't,ep113
1008,have that open field that I like the,ep113
1011,floors aren't really nice they are nice,ep113
1014,but they definitely need work it's not,ep113
1017,gonna be that much work oh it's a good,ep113
1020,size it's a great size I do like these,ep113
1023,tile floors they have a little bit of a,ep113
1026,vintage feel and I think they could lend,ep113
1029,themselves to mid-century modern let's,ep113
1032,check out the bathroom oh this is nasty,ep113
1035,but I think that with just a little bit,ep113
1038,of work we could make this really cute a,ep113
1041,little bit of work yeah we would have to,ep113
1044,take all the tile out put in brand-new,ep113
1047,tile but that shouldn't be too much work,ep113
1050,and we can do that pretty cheaply if we,ep113
1053,do it ourselves maybe but this scares me,ep113
1056,I'm like not comfortable with it,ep113
1059,well definitely if this is the only,ep113
1062,bathroom we can put in it's probably a,ep113
1065,deal-breaker let's check out the,ep113
1068,bedrooms all right it's a decent amount,ep113
1071,of space in here this is the master this,ep113
1074,is the master still have hardwoods here,ep113
1077,that nice open concept do you want they,ep113
1080,look at the second bedroom it's small I,ep113
1083,don't know if either of our stuff would,ep113
1086,fit in here yeah I can't fit my friend,ep113
1089,sure in here and the third bedroom this,ep113
1092,is super creepy and let me sleep me just,ep113
1095,the rubber room in the center of the,ep113
1098,living room they did you can tell here,ep113
1101,there's just all this unfinished work,ep113
1104,here and I bet that wood runs all the,ep113
1107,way into the living room we could take,ep113
1110,these walls out and open this up to the,ep113
1113,main living area you probably could and,ep113
1116,there's possibly some room in here for,ep113
1119,that other bathroom you're looking for I,ep113
1122,think that could really change the feel,ep113
1125,of the house completely,ep113
1128,yeah well the feel right now is creepy,ep113
1131,dungeon so if we can avoid that they see,ep113
1134,the final bedroom this is really small,ep113
1137,okay I have an idea how would I take,ep113
1140,this room and the Blue Room knock down,ep113
1143,the wall and have one big room oh now,ep113
1146,you're knocking down walls,ep113
1149,I may have drained your teams,ep113
1152,[Music],ep113
1155,they head outside to see an attached,ep113
1158,studio oh wow,ep113
1161,actually I mean I do think this could be,ep113
1164,a cool space for my vintage business,ep113
1167,like it's set up an office in here it is,ep113
1170,really nice that it's totally separate,ep113
1173,from the rest of the house,ep113
1176,yeah even has the little bathroom and,ep113
1179,kitchenette it's very clear that the,ep113
1182,people that were living here just left,ep113
1185,in the middle of the night probably,ep113
1188,didn't even turn off the light there's a,ep113
1191,lot to finish up as you can see they,ep113
1194,started working on the foundation oh,ep113
1197,yeah let me show you this show that's,ep113
1200,back here oh this is really great,ep113
1203,there's already all this built-in,ep113
1206,storage - yeah,ep113
1209,and that lofted area up there would be,ep113
1212,really great for getting stuff out of,ep113
1215,the way,ep113
1218,this is definitely a huge plus I think,ep113
1221,that there's a lot of work to be done,ep113
1224,but there's also a lot of potential to,ep113
1227,make this a space that really suits both,ep113
1230,of us I really love that there's the,ep113
1233,shed out back and I think that there's,ep113
1236,just some good bones that we can work,ep113
1239,with with this house the separate studio,ep113
1242,if you could put in some floor and use,ep113
1245,it as my office that would be amazing I,ep113
1248,wouldn't have to rent an office space,ep113
1251,but I am so really overwhelmed by the,ep113
1254,list of everything that needs to be done,ep113
1257,and I just don't know if we have the,ep113
1260,budget or the skills to take those on,ep113
1263,but I really doubt that we're gonna be,ep113
1266,able to find something in our price,ep113
1269,range this close to the city and that's,ep113
1272,really a lot to think about mm-hmm,ep113
1275,since none of the houses come close to,ep113
1278,satisfying both of the Emily's very,ep113
1281,different tastes their decision could,ep113
1284,come down to bedroom size proximity to,ep113
1287,downtown or a house with few projects,ep113
1290,all right which one are you leaning,ep113
1293,towards,ep113
1296,best friends Emily V and Emily o are,ep113
1299,looking to buy their first house,ep113
1302,together in Austin Texas they've seen a,ep113
1305,number of places close to their two,ep113
1308,hundred and seventy five thousand dollar,ep113
1311,price range and now they have to make a,ep113
1314,decision first is an updated cottage at,ep113
1317,two hundred and twenty-five thousand,ep113
1320,dollars I like that it's been updated,ep113
1323,and has some of the renovations done I,ep113
1326,did like the flow of the kitchen into,ep113
1329,the living space I think that it is kind,ep113
1332,of nice that there are two pretty,ep113
1335,separate wings that kind of flank a,ep113
1338,shared area unfortunately one you're,ep113
1341,gonna get flashed in the face with,ep113
1344,headlights and the location is really,ep113
1347,bad next is a mid-century turnkey at two,ep113
1350,hundred and eighty-five thousand I,ep113
1353,obviously love mid-century modern house,ep113
1356,ticks so many of the boxes for me it has,ep113
1359,that great master it has an office space,ep113
1362,for me I really really like the house,ep113
1365,but major sticking points for me are,ep113
1368,it's already over budget and I was,ep113
1371,hoping to do a lot more of that work,ep113
1374,ourselves last is a bungalow rehab,ep113
1377,that's under budget at two hundred and,ep113
1380,thirty five thousand what did you think,ep113
1383,of that total rehab close to the city I,ep113
1386,am terrified of it but the fact that,ep113
1389,there's an office space that's separate,ep113
1392,from the house is really great but the,ep113
1395,potential of structural issues is very,ep113
1398,scary and overwhelming there's just so,ep113
1401,much potential in that house and I think,ep113
1404,that it really could end up taking a lot,ep113
1407,of boxes for both of us,ep113
1410,[Music],ep113
1413,which one are you leaning towards all,ep113
1416,right I can't believe I'm saying this,ep113
1419,you're gonna think I'm a complete,ep113
1422,wackadoo but I think the total rehab,ep113
1425,near the city is gonna give us the space,ep113
1428,that we can make our own and exactly,ep113
1431,what we're looking for I'm actually,ep113
1434,really excited about this I think it's,ep113
1437,gonna be a lot of fun you just don't,ep113
1440,know it yet yes our first plant we found,ep113
1443,our home for two months now so the house,ep113
1446,is listed for two hundred and thirty,ep113
1449,five thousand and we ended up getting it,ep113
1452,for two hundred ten thousand which was,ep113
1455,really great that left us a pretty,ep113
1458,sizable budget for all of the rehab that,ep113
1461,we have to do on the house,ep113
1464,neither of us had any idea about,ep113
1467,foundation work things seem to be going,ep113
1470,well until they try to level the studio,ep113
1473,portion of our house and it just decided,ep113
1476,to kind of break off and head for the,ep113
1479,hills we had previously called in a,ep113
1482,structural engineer before you start at,ep113
1485,the foundation and so we're gonna have,ep113
1488,to yeah call him back we got some,ep113
1491,questions I could see something more,ep113
1494,like these kind of tones as some accents,ep113
1497,mm-hmm pops of color currently in the,ep113
1500,house there's really only one master,ep113
1503,bedroom so they're creating a second,ep113
1506,master suite out of the third and fourth,ep113
1509,bedrooms though who gets which room is,ep113
1512,still TBD until they actually move in,ep113
1515,we're definitely planning on taking that,ep113
1518,terrifying middle room down and hoping,ep113
1521,that we can use some of that space to,ep113
1524,create another bathroom it actually,ep113
1527,backs up to the studio apartment,ep113
1530,bathroom so we can just easily connect,ep113
1533,the plumbing under there and I'm saying,ep113
1536,that this is easy but I really have no,ep113
1539,idea so what do you think the subway,ep113
1542,tile yeah looks great,ep113
1545,I definitely compromised on the amount,ep113
1548,of of work that there's only to take on,ep113
1551,but getting a space that we can really,ep113
1554,make perfect for us I'm willing to put,ep113
1557,in a little bit extra time waiting and,ep113
1560,crashing it in bring it back push down,ep113
1563,the safety,ep113
1566,it's really easy it's actually pretty,ep113
1569,safe to use just keep your thumbs out of,ep113
1572,it yeah it's really cool to put roots,ep113
1575,back down in Austin having grown up here,ep113
1578,and leaving for a while I never knew if,ep113
1581,I would really make it back here,ep113
1584,permanently and to come back to buy my,ep113
1587,own house,ep113
1590,is just kind of an awesome experience,ep113
1593,you wanna try yeah,ep113
12,she's got a great Juliet balcony right,ep114
15,here can you consider me from down there,ep114
18,okay,ep114
21,I'd be like Pavarotti retired judge dick,ep114
24,wants a condo in downtown Tampa with,ep114
27,tons of amenities I have no idea this,ep114
30,would be here I'm really impressed but,ep114
33,on a limited budget he might have to,ep114
36,make some compromises is that the,ep114
39,parking garage for surely we are on a,ep114
42,basement level with his girlfriend,ep114
45,Margaret along for advice and his son as,ep114
48,his broker this won't be an easy hunt,ep114
51,how would they put a washer and dryer in,ep114
54,the closet not exactly what I was hoping,ep114
57,for here at my dad is very cheap to be,ep114
60,frank I want the caviar you know what,ep114
63,I'm saying I want that caviar but you,ep114
66,want to pay for tuna fish I know,ep114
69,[Music],ep114
72,listen I was thinking of taking the boat,ep114
75,out this weekend if you want to go I'm,ep114
78,dick Greta jr. I served a total of 20,ep114
81,years as a judge here in Sydney Tampa,ep114
84,and now I've retired and I appear as an,ep114
87,expert witness on the issue of attorneys,ep114
90,fees and have you been given the file in,ep114
93,this matter I have have you familiarize,ep114
96,yourself with the issues in this case I,ep114
99,have done so my opinion is the time,ep114
102,expended by the attorneys and the,ep114
105,paralegals in the case was reasonable,ep114
108,and necessary I'm Margaret I've been a,ep114
111,judge in Tampa for 13 years and that's,ep114
114,how I know Dicky Hey how are you I'm,ep114
117,good how was your hearing it was good he,ep114
120,and I have been colleagues for a long,ep114
123,time and well we were both married to,ep114
126,different people now we're not and,ep114
129,things just kind of worked out and he's,ep114
132,awesome Dick's roots in Tampa run deep,ep114
135,my great grandmother worked in the cigar,ep114
138,industry in the early 1900s and then my,ep114
141,dad got into politics when I was in,ep114
144,junior high he ran for mayor and won and,ep114
147,he served two terms then came back about,ep114
150,20 years after that and ran again he won,ep114
153,and served two more terms then this is,ep114
156,dick Greco Plaza this is a bronze statue,ep114
159,of my dad very impressive after dick,ep114
162,retired he bought a home 80 miles,ep114
165,outside of Tampa but now he wants to,ep114
168,come to the action downtown where,ep114
171,Margaret lives or to the neighborhood of,ep114
174,Ybor City where his family has roots I,ep114
177,determined that I really want that more,ep114
180,urban lifestyle that I was used to the,ep114
183,downtown area is just exploding with new,ep114
186,things moving in if I could stay close,ep114
189,to all of that all the things that are,ep114
192,happening my friends my family here I,ep114
195,would be very very happy Margaret will,ep114
198,be joining on the hunt and while the,ep114
201,couple agrees that dicks new place,ep114
204,should be low-maintenance and move-in,ep114
207,ready,ep114
210,they have vastly different styles in,ep114
213,mind my style is much more traditional I,ep114
216,like more of the brown earthy tone,ep114
219,colors Brown as well I would agree with,ep114
222,that,ep114
225,I'm definitely more modern I like plain,ep114
228,things clean-lined,ep114
231,I have taste,ep114
234,she's kind of boring I think she has no,ep114
237,taste if you look at some movie well a,ep114
240,totally concrete structure you live in,ep114
243,concrete walls concrete floors and I,ep114
246,respect that this is his place however,ep114
249,I'm trying really hard to get him,ep114
252,outside of that traditional box you know,ep114
255,it's really interesting to think what,ep114
258,this place must have been like when your,ep114
261,great-great-grandmother was down here,ep114
264,making cigars living in the factory our,ep114
267,family's been walking these streets for,ep114
270,over a hundred years I know it,ep114
273,interesting to think about that event,ep114
276,it's unbelievable,ep114
279,my son Garrett is going to be my realtor,ep114
282,and he knows me very well what are you,ep114
285,looking for like a two-bedroom two-bath,ep114
288,place certainly a master bath so that my,ep114
291,guests wouldn't have to use my own,ep114
294,bathroom I think I want to go condo kind,ep114
297,of had enough of the a single-family,ep114
300,home and the maintenance and taking care,ep114
303,of it etc kind of like to have a view if,ep114
306,that's possible at all I'd love to be on,ep114
309,the water and be able to keep my boat,ep114
312,closed but I would like a lot of,ep114
315,amenities I'd like to have a gym I'd,ep114
318,like to have a pool I'd like to have a,ep114
321,really nice maybe courtyard area high on,ep114
324,dicks list is a room to show off his,ep114
327,family heirlooms I would really like to,ep114
330,have a second bedroom to showcase some,ep114
333,of the things that I've collected over,ep114
336,my lifetime I have a couple display,ep114
339,cabinets and on those I want to put some,ep114
342,things that belong to both sets and,ep114
345,grandparents great-grandparents so,ep114
348,what's your budget two hundred and,ep114
351,seventy five thousand okay 275 is kind,ep114
354,of a tight budget you're probably gonna,ep114
357,be compromising on something my dad is,ep114
360,very cheap to be frank he wants,ep114
363,something that's gold-plated but he,ep114
366,wants to pay for 10 foil so it's a bit,ep114
369,of a challenge working with him I want,ep114
372,to start out with you trying to find,ep114
375,most of those amenities I really would,ep114
378,like I want it all but I don't want to,ep114
381,spend that much so here it is works cut,ep114
384,out for him the first place Garrett's,ep114
387,lined up is in the heart of downtown,ep114
390,Tampa in an area near the water called,ep114
393,Harbor Island when you're a kid Harbor,ep114
396,Islands just scrubland,ep114
399,yeah nothing but now it's been totally,ep114
402,redeveloped beautiful newer buildings,ep114
405,this one's about 15 years old wow this,ep114
408,is nice do you like the building I,ep114
411,really do,ep114
414,I like the curb appeal you probably hate,ep114
417,it it's not modern at all now this unit,ep114
420,has two bedrooms and one and a half,ep114
423,bathrooms well that's kind of looking,ep114
426,for two baths,ep114
429,but I know but at 225 it's a really,ep114
432,great deal downtown's right there,ep114
435,chicken blocks I've never even have to,ep114
438,drive the car I'm 63 now I want to get,ep114
441,back now to this type of lifestyle where,ep114
444,you could walk everywhere if you wanted,ep114
447,to so this is the lobby oh wow you have,ep114
450,24-hour concierge really nice it's,ep114
453,24-hour security Wow Jim right down the,ep114
456,hall is a business center I really like,ep114
459,this this is nice nice and traditional,ep114
462,there is a lot of molding well let's go,ep114
465,see the unit yeah all right guys this is,ep114
468,it beautiful real hardwood floors dad I,ep114
471,know you love that oh I like that,ep114
474,that is nice check out the ceiling whoa,ep114
477,20-foot ceilings that is big you can,ep114
480,hear it echo hello it's a really nice,ep114
483,feature that's something you don't,ep114
486,normally see in a condo I kind of like,ep114
489,the light that comes in there and,ep114
492,there's a palm tree that's nice now is,ep114
495,that the parking garage unfortunately we,ep114
498,are in a basement level so you have a,ep114
501,view of the parking garage that it's not,ep114
504,good I really was very disappointed on,ep114
507,the view that's not a pro for this unit,ep114
510,well it is big but it's awful thin maybe,ep114
513,you could do some type of entertainment,ep114
516,unit with shelves or something to put,ep114
519,your stuff you're just like happen it,ep114
522,might work on this wall I think it'd be,ep114
525,perfect here cuz I could put all my you,ep114
528,know family things in here and some of,ep114
531,the shell collection that I have I think,ep114
534,that'll look perfect there alright guys,ep114
537,let's check out the kitchen now Margaret,ep114
540,check out that backsplash Oh probably,ep114
543,been I had a backsplash,ep114
546,I would pick but I certainly can live,ep114
549,with it and certainly I know Margaret,ep114
552,likes it,ep114
555,Granite's really nice I don't like the,ep114
558,cabinets I like the color they're round,ep114
561,round my favorite they see a half bath I,ep114
564,am looking for a place with two bedrooms,ep114
567,two baths this unit doesn't have the two,ep114
570,baths it has a half bath,ep114
573,and head up to see a possible room for,ep114
576,dicks collectibles very small very small,ep114
579,what's this this is a closet and the,ep114
582,washer and dryer oh my gosh how would,ep114
585,they put a washer and dryer in the,ep114
588,closet it's the only space for it takes,ep114
591,up the whole thing there's no stories,ep114
594,not exactly what I was hoping for gear,ep114
597,it,ep114
600,I like the washer and dryer but not one,ep114
603,that took up an entire closet especially,ep114
606,in a place it doesn't have a lot of room,ep114

627,bathroom and walk-in closet oh I like,ep114
630,the granite here okay this is the closet,ep114
633,oh my gosh my closet now is as big as,ep114
636,the master bedroom and I really have to,ep114
639,cut down a lot oh Garrett's gonna bring,ep114
642,up the price again how great the prices,ep114
645,it's your biggest concern down the price,ep114
648,you're all about that number but I want,ep114
651,the caviar you know what I'm saying I,ep114
654,want that caviar for you want to pay for,ep114
657,tuna fish I know I know we head outside,ep114

663,the port yard area Wow,ep114
666,beautiful mountain I really do - isn't,ep114
669,that great this is a smoking area the,ep114
672,only smoking area on the problem yeah,ep114
675,I'm into that so this is the pool area,ep114
678,that's what I'm talking about it's like,ep114
681,a Roman courtyard right here off the,ep114
684,pool is the marina you can purchase it,ep114
687,bucks left oh that would be exactly what,ep114
690,I want got like the building and where,ep114
693,it's located walking distance around,ep114
696,town marina I thought it was pretty much,ep114
699,off the charts but wouldn't even call,ep114
702,that a second bedroom,ep114
705,especially when you open the closet,ep114
708,there's a washer and dryer,ep114
711,the view was not good at all I like the,ep114
714,tall ceilings though those are nice well,ep114
717,what do you think of the amenities of,ep114
720,the building atriums great the pool area,ep114
723,is great the lobby here is very nice all,ep114
726,of that's included in the HOA at 377 a,ep114
729,month yes that that's very reasonable,ep114
732,I like the unit that it's kind of small,ep114
735,so here it finds a place that's a bit,ep114
738,bigger but it's more Margaret style than,ep114
741,Dick's I like this you do this is very,ep114
744,very plain for my taste,ep114
747,[Music],ep114
750,so we get a drink yeah,ep114
753,let's order drink retired judge dick is,ep114
756,on the hunt for a 2-bedroom condo in the,ep114
759,downtown Tampa area so far he and his,ep114
762,girlfriend Margaret have seen a garden,ep114
765,unit condo that had a marina and was,ep114
768,within his two hundred and seventy five,ep114
771,thousand dollar budget but it lacked,ep114
774,room for his collectibles and he didn't,ep114
777,like the view today his son and broker,ep114
780,Garrett he's showing them a place near,ep114
783,downtown in the neighborhood of Ybor,ep114
786,City one of dicks target areas my,ep114
789,great-great grandmother was a cigar,ep114
792,maker here in Ybor City in fact I still,ep114
795,have some of her cigar making equipment,ep114
798,this is a loft conversion from an old,ep114
801,cigar box Factory man I wonder if our,ep114
804,great-great grandmother was ever in this,ep114
807,building that have been cool she could,ep114
810,have been they've done a great job with,ep114
813,it this has got the wow factor the unit,ep114
816,here is 260 thousand that's a little at,ep114
819,the top in the mike budget it has one,ep114
822,bedroom and a den with a full bathroom,ep114
825,and a half bath hmm well I was hoping,ep114
828,for two bedroom two bath but I'd be,ep114
831,willing to take a look at it all right,ep114
834,guys here's the lobby Wow I love the,ep114
837,ceiling with the kippah old wood I like,ep114
840,this you do this is very very plain for,ep114
843,my taste how about the water how close,ep114
846,is the water it's about 10 minutes away,ep114
849,from the nearest boat ramp but it's only,ep114
852,10 minutes okay,ep114
855,coming into this type of building and,ep114
858,seeing just concrete floors and concrete,ep114
861,walls and it's not something I'm used to,ep114
864,but I'm keeping an open mind this is the,ep114
867,pool area my place that's true over here,ep114
870,you have a pool bathroom for the shower,ep114
873,I had no idea this would be here I'm,ep114
876,really impressed you see all of us,ep114
879,pounding out here with an adult beverage,ep114
882,I can and smoking a cigar that would be,ep114
885,great,ep114
888,these kind of commercial buildings that,ep114
891,were then made into lofts usually don't,ep114
894,have hardly any amenities whatsoever,ep114
897,and the fact that this place had this,ep114
900,beautiful pool I mean it was spectacular,ep114
903,all right guys welcome Wow look at the,ep114
906,windows look how much,ep114
909,like there is there is a lot of light,ep114
912,staircase is nice other than that it is,ep114
915,really plain no it's really in right now,ep114
918,is to mix old antiques with the modern,ep114
921,and have an eclectic type of cool it's,ep114
924,such a historic building you have so,ep114
927,much family memorabilia it would look,ep114
930,perfect in here well let's go explore,ep114
933,the kitchen and see if you like that,ep114
936,okay,ep114
939,I like the cabinets you've got granite,ep114
942,countertops stainless appliances those,ep114
945,are nice,ep114
948,I really like how it's open it opens up,ep114
951,into the family space out there great,ep114
954,entertaining space the kitchen was very,ep114
957,very nice it was something that I might,ep114
960,even pick for myself all right dad this,ep114
963,is the dead oh my gosh are you kidding,ep114
966,me you couldn't put anything in you,ep114
969,could put a desk right there if you turn,ep114
972,it to enter your office if you put even,ep114
975,a desk in here you can't even close the,ep114
978,bathroom door the bathroom is bigger,ep114
981,than the den I know my father was a,ep114
984,little disappointed about the dead but,ep114
987,it's very challenging to find a,ep114
990,2-bedroom unit for under 275 and that,ep114
993,extra room really serves a great purpose,ep114
996,so up here is the bedroom so the bedroom,ep114
999,doesn't actually have a doorway or a,ep114
1002,wall its loft style oh man that means no,ep114
1005,privacy at all look the key there's a,ep114
1008,there's a wire so you could hanging,ep114
1011,curtains and close this area off at,ep114
1014,night well that might work you're a huge,ep114
1017,walk-in closet right here Wow,ep114
1020,oh man it is big Garret it's a lot,ep114
1023,bigger than the den is I tell you so far,ep114
1026,this is my favorite room in the house I,ep114
1029,don't mind even the concrete block walls,ep114
1032,in here with some of the painted walls,ep114
1035,right through here is the master,ep114
1038,bathroom,ep114
1041,that's big Wow yeah this is big that's,ep114

1050,that I know you like I like that yeah a,ep114
1053,traditional countertops and double sinks,ep114
1056,the master bath here is very traditional,ep114
1059,just what I would be looking for and the,ep114
1062,washer and dryer is right behind the,ep114
1065,store,ep114

1071,bedroom that is nice it's nice,ep114
1074,[Applause],ep114
1077,I like where it is because it's an,ep114
1080,eboard city I love the windows and not,ep114
1083,an ally I thought the pool area was,ep114
1086,really really nice and most impressive,ep114
1089,to me I think was that master bedroom I,ep114
1092,really really was disappointed in that,ep114
1095,den I mean it's really teeny tiny this,ep114
1098,unit we toured today is completely,ep114
1101,market style and if he doesn't make an,ep114
1104,offer on this place,ep114
1107,I just might I'd like to see something,ep114
1110,that's a two-bedroom two-bath if you,ep114
1113,could find that so Garrett finds a,ep114
1116,two-bedroom two-bath for dick but it,ep114
1119,comes at a price,ep114

1158,to the marina actually so close you can,ep114

1284,Margaret tells me I can't paint the,ep114
1287,kitchen cabinets I don't know why you,ep114
1290,can't paint kitchen cabinets I thought,ep114
1293,that's what paint was for I don't see,ep114
1296,why you can't come in and paint the,ep114
1299,cabinet's brown or green or blue or,ep114
1302,whatever color you want but she says you,ep114
1305,can't do it I say you can well over here,ep114
1308,you have the dedicated dining space what,ep114
1311,do you think about the chandelier well,ep114
1314,in all fairness t.i I like it even,ep114

1332,I do too and then right here in the,ep114
1335,hallway is the washer and dryer they do,ep114
1338,look like they're a little dated in use,ep114
1341,they need to be replaced for sure let's,ep114
1344,move into the bedroom okay for a guest,ep114
1347,bedroom this is pretty good-sized this,ep114
1350,room is this is really big this is what,ep114
1353,I really had in mind a nice den actually,ep114
1356,had a real bed in here if you wanted and,ep114
1359,display cabinets now was that the closet,ep114
1362,for this bedroom where the washer/dryer,ep114
1365,no this room actually has a really great,ep114
1368,size walk-in,ep114
1371,Oh super lots of storage this is good,ep114
1374,yeah I could hang everything I own in,ep114
1377,this place so let's make our way to the,ep114
1380,other side of the condo here where the,ep114
1383,master bedroom is it's a split bedroom,ep114
1386,floor plan so this bedroom is similar in,ep114
1389,size to the guest bedroom you've got a,ep114
1392,great Juliet balcony right here what,ep114
1395,does that mean it means there's a,ep114
1398,threshold there's no back way well but,ep114
1401,Vicky you could certain a view from down,ep114
1404,there okay I feel like Pavarotti,ep114

1422,area is fantastic really nice close to,ep114
1425,the marina oh I love the granite,ep114
1428,countertops I'd also like the cabinetry,ep114
1431,a lot the bedroom and the living room in,ep114
1434,the unit were really kind of small you,ep114
1437,know if you did some updating to it you,ep114
1440,could put your own wow factor on it but,ep114
1443,I have a place I can just move into it's,ep114
1446,decision time but it won't be easy for,ep114
1449,dick it may come down to style room for,ep114
1452,collectibles and whether Garret can get,ep114
1455,the prices dad wants it's time to make a,ep114
1458,decision so when you care,ep114
1461,[Music],ep114
1464,with a strict 275 thousand dollar budget,ep114
1467,retired judge dick is looking to move,ep114
1470,from the outskirts of Tampa to a,ep114
1473,downtown condo with the help of his,ep114
1476,girlfriend Margaret and his son Garrett,ep114
1479,as his broker he's seen several options,ep114
1482,now it's decision time what do you think,ep114
1485,of the garden unit for 225 loved the,ep114
1488,fact that it was right on the water with,ep114
1491,the marine or I could keep the boat,ep114
1494,right there,ep114
1497,I loved the high ceilings those were,ep114
1500,gorgeous the second bedroom really I,ep114
1503,don't know that you could call a bedroom,ep114
1506,really didn't have any of you at all,ep114
1509,right but keep in mind at 225 that was,ep114
1512,the lowest price unit we saw well that's,ep114
1515,true,ep114
1518,so what do you think about the historic,ep114
1521,law for 260 I like the fact that it's a,ep114
1524,kneeboard City with our family's history,ep114
1527,I mean that's important to me I really,ep114
1530,really like the courtyard and pool area,ep114
1533,had no idea something so nice was hidden,ep114
1536,in the middle of that building I loved,ep114
1539,all of the natural light that master,ep114
1542,bathroom was great that second bedroom,ep114
1545,or den or whatever they called it that,ep114
1548,was the smallest thing we saw so let's,ep114
1551,talk about the third-floor condominium,ep114
1554,"for 265,000 I like this location on",ep114
1557,Harbor Island it was close to all of the,ep114
1560,things that I want the whole area was,ep114
1563,really off to charged I love the Cabana,ep114
1566,that was amazing the kitchen was all,ep114
1569,white although I like the cabinets I,ep114
1572,didn't like the colors for me that would,ep114
1575,have to be changed and I really wanted,ep114
1578,something that you know was move-in,ep114
1581,ready,ep114
1584,it was time to make a decision so what,ep114
1587,do you think that,ep114
1590,first I'd like to just say thank you I,ep114
1593,think you did a great great job,ep114
1596,you showed me some really good,ep114
1599,properties I really liked a lot of,ep114
1602,things about each and every one of them,ep114
1605,I think I've made a decision and I think,ep114
1608,I'd like to make an offer on the garden,ep114
1611,condo gave all the amenities I wanted,ep114
1614,had the look I wanted close to the,ep114
1617,marina close to downtown I'd even like,ep114
1620,it more if you can get the price really,ep114
1623,really way down so let's do that,ep114
1626,fantastic I'll make it happen,ep114
1629,great I've been in the unit now only,ep114
1632,about three weeks Jared did a really,ep114
1635,great job negotiating they were asking,ep114
1638,225 but we finally settled on two,ep114
1641,hundred and twelve thousand five hundred,ep114
1644,which i think was a great great price,ep114
1647,but your dad and I were in Key West,ep114
1650,recently and he found this beautiful,ep114
1653,teak wood table so cool I love it I,ep114
1656,really was looking for a place that was,ep114
1659,move-in ready and this place for me was,ep114
1662,I didn't have to do anything except get,ep114
1665,some furniture,ep114
1668,this TV cabinets modern - dad I didn't,ep114
1671,expect that out of here yeah modern and,ep114
1674,brown Wow the entertainment units really,ep114
1677,very contemporary it's not traditional,ep114
1680,at all but it was still brown and it had,ep114
1683,a lot of room for some of my family,ep114
1686,heirlooms and I'm happy with it,ep114
1689,he's also decorated the second bedroom,ep114
1692,with collectibles I'm very happy with,ep114
1695,the move and I really don't even miss,ep114
1698,the old house that I had this is really,ep114
1701,a new chapter oh what a great evening,ep114
1704,isn't it it's absolutely beautiful this,ep114
1707,is what I was talking about I'm so glad,ep114
1710,you're happy that there's so close to,ep114
1713,everything - there's your play I wanted,ep114
1716,a place that was close to a marina,ep114
1719,this place has a marina right outside,ep114
1722,and I can go use it put it up down in,ep114
1725,the water anytime I want which is really,ep114
1728,great this is the perfect unit for me,ep114
1731,you love the water love it love it,ep114

42,don't like that to get the specific,ep115
45,items on their wish list they have to,ep115

51,could remodel it you're not remodeling,ep115
54,at this point you're completely,ep115
57,rebuilding,ep115
60,[Music],ep115
63,[Applause],ep115
66,let's play with them I'm Lindsay I am a,ep115
69,certified financial planner I'm Casey,ep115
72,and I am a fire truck engineer we're a,ep115
75,family of three we have a two and a half,ep115
78,year old daughter named Ross Lee,ep115
81,[Music],ep115
84,Kasey and I met actually back in middle,ep115
87,school and we started dating in our,ep115
90,sophomore year of high school went to,ep115
93,college together got married after our,ep115
96,sophomore year of college and so now,ep115
99,we've been married 11 years in this,ep115
102,relationship I'm the one that's,ep115
105,constantly dreaming of the next big,ep115
108,thing to do big adventure and take his,ep115
111,dreams and turn them into action I mean,ep115
114,I know that you love having us here,ep115
117,especially with ronsley but at some,ep115
120,point soon we need to leave the nest,ep115
123,having outgrown their starter home they,ep115
126,recently sold it and are temporarily,ep115
129,living with Lindsay's parents in Luverne,ep115
132,Minnesota but now they're ready to buy,ep115
135,again and are looking at the Sioux Falls,ep115
138,area just across the state line in South,ep115
141,Dakota Sioux Falls is really a booming,ep115
144,city and we love all that it has to,ep115
147,offer it's got so much entertainment and,ep115
150,restaurants and fun things going on that,ep115
153,we want to be really close to that you,ep115
156,know we really need to talk about the,ep115
159,budget the maximum budget for house hunt,ep115
162,"is 450,000 although I would really",ep115
165,actually like to spend less than that,ep115
168,architecture away there's a bit of a,ep115
171,difference between the two of us I love,ep115
174,the traditional clean lines and look of,ep115
177,a farmhouse style when that's what we,ep115
180,both grew up in also but I still would,ep115
183,like to look at ranches too because I,ep115
186,really like how they're laid out I love,ep115
189,the fact that there is more open concept,ep115
192,so that way you can actually cook supper,ep115
195,and see your daughter playing I don't,ep115
198,like the open concept as much when,ep115
201,you're cooking fish in the kitchen and,ep115
204,you're trying to enjoy watching a movie,ep115
207,in the living room I don't want to have,ep115
210,those two senses mixing and at one time,ep115
213,they'd like four bedrooms in this next,ep115
216,house a large master suite and a,ep115
219,dedicated music room would be ideal,ep115
222,Lindsay and I really love to play me,ep115
225,I play guitar and Lyndsey plays piano,ep115
228,it's a real passion of both of ours to,ep115
231,have ronsley be in there and have that,ep115
234,wonderful gathering space and pass that,ep115
237,along to her definitely I want a big,ep115
240,kitchen I want plenty of space to cook I,ep115
243,want to have just a cozy feeling when,ep115
246,you walk in where it just feels like,ep115
249,home and for her that cozy feeling,ep115
252,includes a finished basement for the,ep115
255,family to relax in to sit down and have,ep115
258,family space maybe a pool table big,ep115
261,wraparound couch watch movies things,ep115
264,like that I absolutely don't want a,ep115
267,basement because their money pits,ep115
270,they smell musty they're underused and,ep115
273,they're a maintenance nightmare,ep115
276,my overall wish list will be over an,ep115
279,acre of land in a garage area that I can,ep115
282,work on motorcycles and cars in plus you,ep115
285,have a lot of wants and desires that's,ep115
288,gonna be tough to find in town district,ep115
291,that Casey wants I'm a volunteer,ep115
294,firefighter it's taken me years to,ep115
297,accumulate the training that I've gone,ep115
300,through so I want to make sure that I'm,ep115
303,within a district that I can still use,ep115
306,my firefighting skills and give back to,ep115
309,the community because that's something,ep115
312,that's very important to me,ep115
315,last time that we got into a house we,ep115
318,said when will renovate soldier I would,ep115
321,love to be in a house that we can open,ep115
324,it up on the first day that we move in,ep115
327,and we can relax ultimately the home,ep115
330,that we find I think will represent just,ep115
333,the next chapter in our life every way,ep115
336,and we've really been hand-in-hand and,ep115
339,this is just another another step for us,ep115
342,and I'm so excited to take the step with,ep115
345,you yeah,ep115
348,first up their agent Aaron is showing,ep115
351,them a ranch-style hey guys Aaron how's,ep115
354,it going good senior well I'm really,ep115
357,excited to show this house we have a,ep115
360,1971 ranch which I know what you're,ep115
363,looking yeah it's got the single level,ep115
366,living that I'm looking for yeah we're,ep115
369,on almost two acres and it's priced at,ep115
372,310 awesome well below our budget,ep115
375,yeah we're also in the spilitt Rock,ep115
378,section of Sioux Falls okay so be in,ep115
381,this foot Rock Fire District it would be,ep115
384,yeah yeah well thank you look okay,ep115
387,gosh those up this face when you walk in,ep115
390,the front door step into the living room,ep115
393,here okay I like how big and spacious,ep115
396,this is yeah it's kind of like walking,ep115
399,back in time though right,ep115
402,you know I don't really like hardwood,ep115
405,floors in a living room I just I think,ep115
408,carpet is so much more inviting and warm,ep115
411,and cozy you look at the backyard though,ep115
414,can't you just see the dogs and Roz Lee,ep115
417,just running around and playing in a big,ep115
420,deck area great for entertaining yeah I,ep115
423,think I should check out this space over,ep115
426,here,ep115
429,okay gosh we can maybe use this for like,ep115
432,a music room so separate from the family,ep115
435,room area and it isn't all open-concept,ep115
438,all right well I think we should go look,ep115
441,in the kitchen follow me all right guys,ep115
444,here's the kitchen this is ninety one is,ep115
447,it like a wood paneling,ep115
450,no lights that's great that doesn't seem,ep115
453,to match anything else in here the,ep115
456,kitchen is I mean I don't even know how,ep115
459,to put that into words really I mean out,ep115
462,of disco ball and we're back in the,ep115
465,1970s is kind of how I feel now you guys,ep115
468,have to remember this is at the lower,ep115
471,end of your budget there's a lot of room,ep115
474,to make renovations that's true I mean,ep115
477,we could really modernize this and put,ep115
480,our own blueprints on it well you'd have,ep115
483,to because there's really nothing to,ep115
486,salvage out of it down the hall they,ep115
489,take a peek at two bedrooms before,ep115
492,heading into the master Wow I half,ep115
495,expected to see mirrors on the ceiling,ep115
498,this is so underwhelming now you do have,ep115
501,a nice view to your backyard from the,ep115
504,master bedroom that's true okay well I,ep115
507,think we should take a look at the,ep115
510,master bathroom okay great I don't know,ep115
513,which is better than wallpaper or the,ep115
516,tiny tub that I don't think either of us,ep115
519,could,ep115
522,I guess you could remodel it but again,ep115
525,we're remodeling a lot of things already,ep115
528,you're not remodeling at this point,ep115
531,you're completely rebuilding back,ep115
534,through the kitchen they head down to,ep115
537,the basement,ep115
540,it looks like it's finished that's nice,ep115
543,yeah we got a notice full bath and two,ep115
546,more bedrooms okay so a lot of space,ep115
549,down here that is the the five bedrooms,ep115
552,that I was hoping for you could do a,ep115
555,pool table maybe a TV and a nice couch,ep115
558,and family area but you can small it,ep115
561,right away it's got that musty basement,ep115
564,smell all right well as long as we're,ep115
567,keeping it open mine yeah I gotta come,ep115
570,more space I want to show you okay,ep115
573,back upstairs Aaron shows them the,ep115
576,garage kind of short on storage space,ep115
579,and not really much of a workbench area,ep115
582,I can see you're a little bit,ep115
585,disappointed but guess what let's go,ep115
588,through that door oh wow this is really,ep115
591,nice area think of all the projects I,ep115
594,could do in a place like this you have a,ep115
597,motorcycle car set up the garage in the,ep115
600,shop really are the thing that are,ep115
603,making me rethink this whole property it,ep115
606,makes it one that we really should,ep115
609,consider,ep115
612,well you know I mean as we kind of go,ep115
615,down our wish list it seems to check,ep115
618,everything off it's got the four,ep115
621,bedrooms three bathrooms base for a,ep115
624,music room I always got your shot yeah,ep115
627,that's very nice and it does have two,ep115
630,acres of land which is double the size,ep115
633,that we were looking at that's,ep115
636,ridiculous,ep115
639,but when we walked in there were a lot,ep115
642,of cosmetic changes that would,ep115
645,definitely need to be updated it,ep115
648,definitely was a renovation heavy house,ep115
651,you know that's something that we really,ep115
654,have to take into account when we're,ep115
657,looking at it so their agent has set up,ep115
660,a house in nearby Brandon that's move-in,ep115
663,ready but now I see there's a side yard,ep115
666,that might be a problem because we can't,ep115
669,really get a fence in here,ep115
672,[Music],ep115
675,[Applause],ep115
678,looking to get out of her parents house,ep115
681,Lindsay and volunteer fireman husband,ep115
684,"Casey have a $450,000 budget to find",ep115
687,their new home in Sioux Falls South,ep115
690,Dakota so far they've seen a five,ep115
693,bedroom ranch home that was way below,ep115
696,their budget but it had a small master,ep115
699,suite and needed a lot of work so now,ep115
702,they're heading to another option well,ep115
705,we've got a great house here in Brandon,ep115
708,a suburb of Sioux Falls so it's within,ep115
711,the Brandon fire district it is yeah,ep115
714,that's really good it's a two-story farm,ep115
717,style house yeah I love the farm style,ep115
720,it's got three bedrooms two and a,ep115
723,bathrooms built in 2006 now I see,ep115
726,there's a side yard that might be a,ep115
729,problem because we can't really get a,ep115
732,fence in here quite a choice for Roz,ep115
735,Leigh and for the dogs that easily,ep115
738,there's some really nice features of,ep115
741,this home that I think we should give it,ep115
744,a shot okay,ep115
747,okay great this is nice,ep115
750,this is really cozy in here right I like,ep115
753,the feel of it yeah it's a nice area,ep115
756,it's are pretty windows it lets a lot of,ep115
759,bright sunshine in I love the woodwork,ep115
762,yeah it doesn't have that cookie cutter,ep115
765,feel like some home tab well we have,ep115
768,more to look at there's actually a,ep115
771,really nice family room over here oh,ep115
774,yeah really nice this would be a great,ep115
777,music room area Oh with the high,ep115
780,ceilings the acoustics in here would be,ep115
783,pretty good and it does have some nice,ep115
786,separation from the other rooms but it,ep115
789,isn't soul separated you saw the sight,ep115
792,lines yeah so it's kind of that semi,ep115
795,open-concept,ep115
798,oh it's the big kitchen that I am,ep115
801,looking for a great space and look at,ep115
804,the floors that's I love the maple,ep115
807,floors I don't like this paint color no,ep115
810,gosh we would definitely have to repeat,ep115
813,don't look at the countertops oh they,ep115
816,don't match oh that's kind of mmm I,ep115
819,don't like that that's yeah we went hmmm,ep115
822,wonder why they would have done that,ep115
825,yeah I don't like that at all they head,ep115
828,up to the second floor and take a peek,ep115
831,at two bedrooms and a full bath before,ep115
834,heading to the master suite Wow it's,ep115
837,very spacious absolutely awesome whoa,ep115
840,let's check out the bathroom,ep115
843,okay Wow whew shot the whole football,ep115
846,team in there that's about right look at,ep115
849,the devil sings I could do my space,ep115
852,you're gonna have yours how nice is that,ep115
855,that's really cool they make their way,ep115
858,back down to the first floor to see the,ep115
861,attached garage Casey this is your space,ep115
864,here got a nice two stall garage kind of,ep115
867,disappointed that it's only a two stall,ep115
870,garage so once we get two cars and a,ep115
873,motorcycle and all of Rossi stuff in,ep115
876,here I really don't see any place that I,ep115
879,can work on anything the garage is small,ep115
882,and there's no shop or work space that,ep115
885,might be a deal-breaker they head back,ep115
888,in through the house and down to the,ep115
891,large unfinished basement you know I,ep115
894,mean gosh there's space down here we,ep115
897,could add that fourth bedroom that we,ep115
900,were hoping for maybe a bathroom and,ep115
903,maybe some family room or you could just,ep115
906,leave it as storage,ep115
909,I mean well what I think about finishing,ep115
912,off a basement you could even use part,ep115
915,of it as storage but then the rest of it,ep115
918,we could finish off and have as,ep115
921,additional living space I still would,ep115
924,like to just keep it a storage yeah well,ep115
927,that way then we can discuss it later I,ep115
930,guess,ep115
933,[Music],ep115
936,it hit a lot of our must-haves I mean,ep115
939,it's got a nice big kitchen it's got,ep115
942,that nice cozy feel well it's a great,ep115
945,neighborhood and it's a plus that's,ep115
948,within the brand and Fire District and I,ep115
951,love the way that it's a traditional,ep115
954,farmhouse style but there are a lot of,ep115
957,things that it didn't hit a mark on I,ep115
960,mean it doesn't have four bedrooms right,ep115
963,now it doesn't have three baths yeah and,ep115
966,you didn't seem to like the lawn very,ep115
969,much yeah cuz we'd have to put in a,ep115
972,fence and it might be kind of an odd,ep115
975,yard to put a fence in doesn't have the,ep115
978,garage space that I was really looking,ep115
981,for in a shop area and then you know we,ep115
984,have your unfinished basement what did,ep115
987,you think of that it would add to the,ep115
990,budget to finish the basement so we,ep115
993,definitely have to keep that mind sure,ep115
996,you do want to be conscious of the,ep115
999,budget so keeping their must-haves in,ep115
1002,mind aaron has set up a house that has,ep115
1005,almost everything is there a fire,ep115
1008,department that Casey could belong to no,ep115
1011,there's no volunteer fire department oh,ep115
1014,I don't like that,ep115
1017,[Music],ep115
1020,let's go tickle their noses working with,ep115
1023,a four hundred and fifty thousand dollar,ep115
1026,budget Casey and Lindsey are looking to,ep115
1029,buy in the Sioux Falls area of South,ep115
1032,Dakota so far they've seen a five,ep115
1035,bedroom ranch home that needed work but,ep115
1038,it's sat on two acres and was way under,ep115
1041,their max budget then they saw a,ep115
1044,two-story farmhouse that had a big,ep115
1047,kitchen and great master suite but it,ep115
1050,was missing the fourth bedroom they want,ep115
1053,the basement was unfinished and there,ep115
1056,was no workshop today their agent has,ep115
1059,set up a house that doesn't match either,ep115
1062,of their styles but he thinks will meet,ep115
1065,most of their wish list so we have a,ep115
1068,two-story contemporary five bedrooms,ep115
1071,four baths perfect over half an acre a,ep115
1074,lot Wow lot of space John,ep115
1077,"it's got over 2,800 square feet and is",ep115
1080,"priced at 420,000 okay it's very nice I",ep115
1083,like it now is there a fire department,ep115
1086,that Casey could belong to no there's no,ep115
1089,volunteer fire department I don't like,ep115
1092,that let's go take a look okay yeah get,ep115
1095,out of this cold mm-hmm all right guys,ep115
1098,come on in this is really nice Wow yeah,ep115
1101,natural light coming down from the,ep115
1104,skylight I love that kind of look,ep115
1107,awesome oh this is busy this is very,ep115
1110,pretty you know it has a just a really,ep115
1113,cozy feeling in here I could see just,ep115
1116,warming up by the fireplace reading a,ep115
1119,book maybe even putting my piano in the,ep115
1122,corner or something like that that would,ep115
1125,look nice well you guys want to take a,ep115
1128,look at the kitchen yeah this is good it,ep115
1131,feels really spacious in here also and I,ep115
1134,like the French doors that lead right,ep115
1137,out to a big deck it could really expand,ep115
1140,our kitchen area here and would be,ep115
1143,really nice for entertaining and a,ep115
1146,really nice backyard yeah look at the,ep115
1149,butcher block countertop that's nice,ep115
1152,in the white countertops very very,ep115
1155,trendy looking although it's you know I,ep115
1158,mean where's my sight line to watch,ep115
1161,Rosalie play if I'm in here cooking oh,ep115
1164,yeah,ep115
1167,there's no way that I can see all the,ep115
1170,way over to the living room to watch Roz,ep115
1173,Lee playing it's so very nice area and I,ep115
1176,do I like the separation between the two,ep115
1179,rooms this house definitely has those,ep115
1182,designated areas you know you're in the,ep115
1185,kitchen you know you're in the living,ep115
1188,room it doesn't wash all together into,ep115
1191,one giant room they head up to the,ep115
1194,second floor and take a look at two,ep115
1197,bedrooms and a full bathroom before,ep115
1200,heading into the master suite oh wow,ep115
1203,this is really spacious a lot of room,ep115
1206,yeah absolutely it's very bright the big,ep115
1209,window letting light in so you got your,ep115
1212,own private bathroom here to non suite,ep115
1215,it's got double vanities you know it's,ep115
1218,nice that there's a double sink I really,ep115
1221,do like that but the cabinet's don't,ep115
1224,really seem to be updated and there's,ep115
1227,not much for storage in here I mean it,ep115
1230,definitely gets a job done but certainly,ep115
1233,it's not a really ideal bathroom that I,ep115
1236,was hoping for for the extra bedrooms,ep115
1239,and living space they head down to the,ep115
1242,basement all right Lindsay we have your,ep115
1245,finished basement perfect which has two,ep115
1248,bedrooms full bath and back here we have,ep115
1251,a nice family room beautiful look at,ep115
1254,just lots of room for Roz Lee and all of,ep115
1257,our cousins to play have a choice,ep115
1260,sitting around but it is a finished,ep115
1263,basement and I really didn't wanna,ep115
1266,because of the moisture issues and,ep115
1269,everything like that,ep115
1272,is there any like workspace down here,ep115
1275,that I could work on stuff in no the,ep115
1278,basement has no room for like workshop,ep115
1281,for you so I think we're going to go to,ep115
1284,the garage see if there's space up there,ep115
1287,for that oh this is disappointingly,ep115
1290,small yeah I don't know if this is gonna,ep115
1293,work for what you're looking for No,ep115
1296,[Music],ep115
1299,to modern style but I mean it's kind of,ep115
1302,a compromise on both of our tastes,ep115
1305,yeah the fireplace was cozy the beams,ep115
1308,were a nice touch to it as well,ep115
1311,I like finished basement so of course,ep115
1314,I'm gonna like that and it had five,ep115
1317,bedrooms I mean the the last two,ep115
1320,bedrooms down there so it's plenty of,ep115
1323,space we wouldn't have to remodel,ep115
1326,anything but but no work space down in,ep115
1329,the basement yeah I have any idea where,ep115
1332,I put my tools I guess we could always,ep115
1335,build another shop outside of it big lot,ep115
1338,too so yeah think about the yard yeah,ep115
1341,there's a lot of potential in there,ep115
1344,since all of the houses came in under,ep115
1347,budget they'll have to decide what's,ep115
1350,most important a finished basement no,ep115
1353,renovations or being near a volunteer,ep115
1356,fire department,ep115
1359,well we've seen plenty of houses I think,ep115
1362,it's time that we get out of the in-laws,ep115
1365,house and make a decision on where we're,ep115
1368,actually going to end up,ep115
1371,[Music],ep115
1374,"working with a budget of 450,000 dollars",ep115
1377,Casey and Lindsay are looking to buy in,ep115
1380,the Sioux Falls area of South Dakota,ep115
1383,they've seen several options now they're,ep115
1386,ready to choose what did you think about,ep115
1389,the ranch-style house for three hundred,ep115
1392,and nine thousand you know I love that,ep115
1395,it's a ranch just because that's the,ep115
1398,style that I'm looking for and I love,ep115
1401,the yard that house is a major,ep115
1404,renovation nightmare but it was also so,ep115
1407,far under our budget that we could make,ep115
1410,it our own and put her and stamp on it,ep115
1413,and it did have all the bedrooms that,ep115
1416,had the shop and it met your,ep115
1419,requirements in the fire department,ep115
1422,it really did check off most of the,ep115
1425,things on our list but all I see is I,ep115
1428,was thinking about how are we ever going,ep115
1431,to find time to do these projects to fix,ep115
1434,up this house well so what do you think,ep115
1437,"about the farmhouse style for 339,000",ep115
1440,I'd really liked the style of it and I,ep115
1443,loved that it was in the fire district I,ep115
1446,love the fact that it's pretty much,ep115
1449,move-in ready I love that kitchen I also,ep115
1452,loved how huge the master bedroom was in,ep115
1455,that bathroom it had a jetted tub it had,ep115
1458,a huge walk-in shower you know the the,ep115
1461,downside is that the house only had,ep115
1464,three bedrooms and I was really looking,ep115
1467,for at least four the nice part about,ep115
1470,that is that at least has room for those,ep115
1473,bedrooms in the basement but it didn't,ep115
1476,really have any workspace down there no,ep115
1479,workshop in the basement no workshop in,ep115
1482,the garage I guess we could always build,ep115
1485,another shop outside of it I think,ep115
1488,there's room in the corner a lot but,ep115
1491,we'd have to make that work with our,ep115
1494,budget so what about the contemporary,ep115
1497,"home for 418,000 yeah I like the updates",ep115
1500,that they did to it that it was all done,ep115
1503,but we were in a more central part of,ep115
1506,Sioux Falls and that pretty much does,ep115
1509,away with any chance of being on any,ep115
1512,volunteer fire department but it was,ep115
1515,everything that we were looking for in a,ep115
1518,house in terms of the space the number,ep115
1521,of bedrooms means a yard but it didn't,ep115
1524,have a big enough garage and it didn't,ep115
1527,offer any like workspace in eshop area,ep115
1530,the garage was pretty small I don't know,ep115
1533,if there'd be even room to add on,ep115
1536,something there,ep115
1539,well we've seen plenty of houses I think,ep115
1542,it's time that we get out of the in-laws,ep115
1545,house and make a decision on where we're,ep115
1548,actually going to end up,ep115
1551,I think I know what you want and as much,ep115
1554,as I want a ranch I think that farmhouse,ep115
1557,style is a perfect house for us I think,ep115
1560,it is - it's good with our budget big,ep115
1563,master bedroom and master bathroom and,ep115
1566,it's not a lot of projects and,ep115
1569,renovations that we're gonna be walking,ep115
1572,into and I think after we build the shop,ep115
1575,well the perfect house yeah I agree,ep115
1578,um maybe after we finished the basement,ep115
1581,but yeah that's a dress that in the,ep115
1584,future,ep115
1587,should we go chase a puppy you go chase,ep115
1590,a puppy's we've been living in the home,ep115
1593,for about three weeks now and it feels,ep115
1596,just so nice to be settled in to be,ep115
1599,getting comfortable and making it our,ep115
1602,"own Oh the house was listed for $339,000",ep115
1605,couple of changes to the house already,ep115
1608,we've changed paint colors in a couple,ep115
1611,rooms we've replaced light fixtures in,ep115
1614,the majority of the house we've got new,ep115
1617,curtains new furniture things like that,ep115
1620,just really decorated and made it our,ep115
1623,own we could have put our bed sheets,ep115
1626,over the windows that would have worked,ep115
1629,just fine this is not our college dorm,ep115
1632,room dear this is our nice new house so,ep115
1635,we chose this house because you walk in,ep115
1638,and it has that cozy feel it's full of,ep115
1641,charm it's full of character it's four,ep115
1644,blocks away from the fire department and,ep115
1647,eventually we're gonna get a workshop,ep115
1650,built in the side yards after that's,ep115
1653,done it's in my mind the perfect home,ep115
1656,this house is perfect in terms of size,ep115
1659,for us right now,ep115
1662,eventually when our family does grow,ep115
1665,we've got room in the basement to finish,ep115
1668,that up and create more bedrooms if,ep115
1671,needed the part of the house that I like,ep115
1674,best is the music room we spend so much,ep115
1677,family time in there it's it's really,ep115
1680,been a wonderful space together okay I,ep115
1683,think this house holds a lot of,ep115
1686,possibilities for our future it's you,ep115
1689,know more children that we hope to have,ep115
1692,holiday gatherings with our families,ep115
1695,it's just really nice to be settled and,ep115
1698,not be so Restless kind of waiting for,ep115
1701,the next chapter,ep115
12,this is what mid-century modern living,ep116
15,is all about this is perfect,ep116
18,Alejo and Gisela want to leave the,ep116
21,suburbs behind for a rare mid-century,ep116
24,modern in the city the orange door in,ep116
27,the blue I think that looks great it's,ep116
30,really like nothing else you'd see in,ep116
33,any other neighborhood he's ready for a,ep116
36,project the floor needs to go but I,ep116
39,actually like that while she wants,ep116
42,perfection I love and hate this kitchen,ep116
45,I like wood paneling but I don't even,ep116
48,know what this is,ep116
51,with only so many mid centuries to,ep116
54,choose from can they find something they,ep116
57,both like this one's close I don't know,ep116
60,this wall right here is a little crazy I,ep116
63,guess if we ever had like a zombie,ep116
66,apocalypse would be safe it's actually,ep116
69,kind of tight I don't care about the,ep116
72,size I just like this,ep116
75,[Music],ep116
78,[Applause],ep116
81,[Music],ep116
84,perfect day for a ride so what do you,ep116
87,want to do put in 100 miles I know my,ep116
90,name is Gisela and I'm a teacher,ep116
93,my name is Alejo I am an associate,ep116
96,investment manager for a pension fund,ep116
99,don't leave me behind okay let's go we,ep116
102,met because my cousin married his cousin,ep116
105,and we actually met at their wedding the,ep116
108,rest is history yes yeah we have two,ep116
111,kids we have a son and a daughter our,ep116
114,daughter is 14 and our son is 12 after,ep116
117,living in suburban Sacramento for the,ep116
120,last 14 years they're ready to make a,ep116
123,move closer to downtown Sacramento to me,ep116
126,still has a small-town feel but you get,ep116
129,some of the amenities that come with a,ep116
132,big city you know we have some sports,ep116
135,teams here now good restaurants to eat,ep116
138,but it's not crazy like some of the,ep116
141,bigger cities or too congested currently,ep116
144,we live in eight 3200 square foot home,ep116
147,and I'm looking more for something maybe,ep116
150,"between 1,700 to 2,000 square feet we're",ep116
153,looking for a 1950s 1960s either,ep116
156,mid-century modern or mid-century ranch,ep116
159,this interest in homes from the 50s and,ep116
162,60s house started with a trip that we,ep116
165,took to Palm Springs and we were there,ep116
168,for their modernism week which is where,ep116
171,you can actually tour some of these,ep116
174,homes we did one of those tours and I,ep116
177,just absolutely fell in love with a,ep116
180,mid-century modern style that aesthetic,ep116
183,really appeals to the way I want to live,ep116
186,which is just simplicity a lot of light,ep116
189,kind of big open spaces for us we don't,ep116
192,want just a plain house to us a house is,ep116
195,more of an extension of your personality,ep116
198,and we want something special this is,ep116
201,the entrance and I do love the bright,ep116
204,door against kind of the the lighter,ep116
207,color that's really neat we'd want to,ep116
210,stay around what we can sell our house,ep116
213,for and I believe that's around six,ep116
216,hundred thousand I really don't want to,ep116
219,go much above that what I want in a home,ep116
222,is at least a three-bedroom two-bathroom,ep116
225,I would love the rooms to be a larger,ep116
228,size and what we currently have,ep116
231,especially for the kids as they're,ep116
234,growing they kind of need a little bit,ep116
237,more space they'd also like dual sinks,ep116
240,in the master bath and alejo in,ep116
243,particular is interested in one extra,ep116
246,dedicated space,ep116
249,I would like to have an area that I can,ep116
252,exercise in so we'll see if we can get,ep116
255,that love the beams going across the,ep116
258,ceiling love all the white I would just,ep116
261,love kind of one large living space like,ep116
264,not necessarily a formal living room in,ep116
267,a formal dining room I love a lot of,ep116
270,windows that look out onto a pool that,ep116
273,is what I'm talking yeah I've got to,ep116
276,have something like that for sure I,ep116
279,definitely want to have like that resort,ep116
282,living in our own home location-wise,ep116
285,he'd like to be within biking distance,ep116
288,of work if I can take out the stressful,ep116
291,commute and jump on my bike and enjoy,ep116
294,Brighton to work it'd be pretty awesome,ep116
297,I'd rather have a move-in-ready even if,ep116
300,it's not exactly what I want it's still,ep116
303,something that over time we can change,ep116
306,instead of redoing everything for me I,ep116
309,would rather have something that I can,ep116
312,fix up a little bit the current home,ep116
315,that we have my brother and I have done,ep116
318,a lot of work on it I have to say one,ep116
321,thing I'm really gonna miss is this tile,ep116
324,you did a really great job with that I,ep116
327,want something that I can take pride in,ep116
330,and say well yeah you know great house,ep116
333,yeah well I did this I did that and it's,ep116
336,really but that always takes way too,ep116
339,much time and way too much money and the,ep116
342,headache of a renovation we're excited,ep116
345,about starting a new chapter in our,ep116
348,lives just doing something different,ep116
351,that we've never done before,ep116
354,the first house their agent lines up is,ep116
357,a little outside their target area about,ep116
360,11 miles from downtown it is absolutely,ep116
363,hard to find a mid-century of modern,ep116
366,home like this they're very rare so when,ep116
369,they come on the market they seek them,ep116
372,out nice neighborhood but definitely a,ep116
375,little far from work it will be so far,ep116
378,for me probably 45 minutes to an hour hi,ep116
381,ho hi Casella IRA how are you guys doing,ep116
384,today,ep116
387,crepes wonderful whoa got a mid-century,ep116
390,modern home to show you today I love it,ep116
393,three bedrooms two bathrooms and it's,ep116
396,listed at 675 thousand,ep116
399,I do love the French the orange door and,ep116
402,the blue I think that looks great in the,ep116
405,pitched roof so I'm excited to see the,ep116
408,rest we can go take a look and see what,ep116
411,you think,ep116
414,this is what I like I like all of the,ep116
417,glass the big windows looking out on the,ep116
420,beautiful backyard I love this yeah I,ep116
423,gotta agree these windows are awesome,ep116
426,and I love the view to the outside it's,ep116
429,the pool the only thing I would say is,ep116
432,that I was sort of looking for a big,ep116
435,open space where everyone can gather and,ep116
438,this seems cut off from everything else,ep116
441,but what's on the other side of the wall,ep116
444,the kitchen's on the other side oh this,ep116
447,is a great kitchen I think when you,ep116
450,remodel a mid-century home you just have,ep116
453,to do it right and they would definitely,ep116
456,do it the right way it is nice but I,ep116
459,don't see really any room where we can,ep116
462,kind of put our own personal touches on,ep116
465,it I just kind of feel that you know at,ep116
468,this price point I'm kind of paying for,ep116
471,somebody else's ideas that's what I like,ep116
474,about it everything is done,ep116
477,I think our furniture will fit in here,ep116
480,perfectly and I like how you have the,ep116
483,dining area here but then you can also,ep116
486,have people sit outside as well in the,ep116
489,backyard this bathroom is really cute I,ep116
492,love the color there storage in two,ep116
495,different spots and I love have the,ep116
498,shower just go with everything else so,ep116
501,is this the bedroom right here yes it is,ep116
504,this is a really big room this will be,ep116
507,perfect for our daughter,ep116
510,yeah this is a great size for is the,ep116
513,master bedroom like this oh well let's,ep116
516,go take a look it's next oh it's big,ep116
519,it's just perfect yeah you can,ep116
522,definitely fit a nice big king-size bed,ep116
525,in here yeah that is true okay so this,ep116
528,closets not huge but do you think the,ep116
531,two of us can fit our clothes in there,ep116
534,we can definitely fit a lot of shoes in,ep116
537,there that is true and then is that the,ep116
540,master bathroom it is what's really nice,ep116
543,is all the finishes have been updated,ep116
546,recently it looks really great it seems,ep116
549,to match with everything else that's in,ep116
552,the house one thing though it's not,ep116
555,gonna work for us to get ready at the,ep116
558,same time because it's just one area not,ep116
561,two separate areas so that means two,ep116
564,people can't really get ready at the,ep116
567,same time,ep116
570,they see a third bedroom before heading,ep116
573,outside to a casita you are looking for,ep116
576,a place to have a gym this just might,ep116
579,fit that bill oh wow this is great,ep116
582,I like how they kind of continue the,ep116
585,theme of the home it's almost like a,ep116
588,small replica of the house this is what,ep116
591,it's all about just the pool and then,ep116
594,you have all the lush greenery and the,ep116
597,trees,ep116
600,I love how relaxing and peaceful it is,ep116
603,out here I like all the greenery I like,ep116
606,the mature Japanese maples they're,ep116
609,beautiful and as an added bonus we have,ep116
612,the hot tub over there that is nice so,ep116
615,what did you think about the home what,ep116
618,were your impressions well first off let,ep116
621,me go off what I did like the master,ep116
624,bathroom it doesn't have the two,ep116
627,separate areas and for me I'd like to,ep116
630,maybe put my touch on it a little bit,ep116
633,and it didn't really have any room for,ep116
636,projects for me I do like the house,ep116
639,though I think it had some great points,ep116
642,as well I love the kitchen and left all,ep116
645,the bathrooms all those updates are just,ep116
648,really what I want I don't want to have,ep116
651,to do anything myself I feel like we,ep116
654,could just come in move in our things,ep116
657,and just enjoy it,ep116
660,and of course the backyard was great I,ep116
663,think the biggest problem for me though,ep116
666,is that it is so far from my job so,ep116
669,their agent finds an option closer to,ep116
672,Sacramento but I can actually hear the,ep116
675,freeway I don't like that,ep116
678,[Music],ep116
681,I love this table it actually seats six,ep116
684,people and these chairs Wow,ep116
687,Alejo and Gisela are moving from the,ep116
690,suburbs to be closer to downtown,ep116
693,Sacramento California they're only,ep116
696,interested in a mid-century modern house,ep116
699,that they can buy with their budget of,ep116
702,"around $600,000 so far they've seen an",ep116
705,updated home that was move-in ready,ep116
708,perfect for Gisela but not for Alejo,ep116
711,who's looking forward to putting his own,ep116
714,stamp on a home and it was located about,ep116
717,11 miles from downtown Sacramento a,ep116
720,little farther than they want to be so,ep116
723,today they're seeing another option this,ep116
726,time closer to downtown this house is,ep116
729,actually a good location because I can,ep116
732,get to the freeway pretty quickly but at,ep116
735,the same time I can actually hear the,ep116
738,freeway yeah I don't like that hi Gisela,ep116
741,welcome I have another mid-century,ep116
744,modern home to show you a four-bedroom,ep116
747,two-bathroom home fantastic price tag at,ep116
750,"500,000 whoa I love the price on that",ep116
753,that's really good price what do you,ep116
756,think of the curb appeal this wall right,ep116
759,here is a little crazy,ep116
762,I guess if we ever had like a zombie,ep116
765,apocalypse would be safe oh we get,ep116
768,inside you'll see it forms a nice little,ep116
771,courtyard so you might like that Wow I,ep116
774,don't really hear the traffic noise as,ep116
777,much in here yeah now the brick wall it,ep116
780,actually makes sense because it makes,ep116
783,everything feel nice and peaceful in,ep116
786,here and I actually kind of liked it,ep116
789,what I do really like are the big,ep116
792,sliders and how it has a view of the,ep116
795,kitchen so you can make dinner and then,ep116
798,bring your food outside and enjoy it,ep116
801,outside in this beautiful courtyard no,ep116
804,that's definitely a plus yeah I'm ready,ep116
807,to head on inside,ep116
810,yeah don't worry Wow I love all these,ep116
813,windows I love this brick this is,ep116
816,actually the same brick that's out front,ep116
819,and I do like it this is multi right,ep116
822,sure does not fit into the style so,ep116
825,definitely something that I could take,ep116
828,off and then if you look at the floor,ep116
831,the floor needs to go but I actually,ep116
834,like that because I think me and my,ep116
837,brother can come in,ep116
840,make it into something really nice okay,ep116
843,that's gonna take time and money to do,ep116
846,put your own stamp on it so it would be,ep116
849,pretty cool when I think about how,ep116
852,demanding his job is and how he gets,ep116
855,home and he's really tired I just don't,ep116
858,see how he's gonna have the time and the,ep116
861,energy to renovate this house this,ep116
864,sounds really strange but I love and,ep116
867,hate this kitchen at the same time I,ep116
870,love these cabinets I wouldn't change,ep116
873,them I actually like the flat front,ep116
876,I love the knobs but I definitely,ep116
879,replaced the countertops,ep116
882,check out the appliances though they,ep116
885,look brand there and you have gas stove,ep116
888,top too which is kind of yes but look,ep116
891,how low this is I mean I do love these,ep116
894,long countertops but again they're,ep116
897,pretty low the kitchen can use some,ep116
900,improvement maybe the countertops so I,ep116
903,do see a lot of room for improvement,ep116
906,here and that's something that I,ep116
909,definitely like next they see the,ep116
912,backyard it is a very lush back here,ep116
915,which I do like I like all the trees and,ep116
918,mature birch trees the greenery is great,ep116
921,but do you think a pool will be able to,ep116
924,actually fit you can get a pool in this,ep116
927,backyard but it is going to take that,ep116
930,but good portion of your yard so we,ep116
933,could potentially lose all of the screen,ep116
936,rate yes I think I'm okay with that as,ep116
939,long as we have the pool back inside,ep116
942,they take a look at the bedrooms this,ep116
945,will work I think the kids will be happy,ep116
948,yeah it's a good size but as far for,ep116
951,sure please do that it just keeps going,ep116
954,and going and going and finding more and,ep116
957,more issues let's go look at the master,ep116
960,suite okay so kind of nice I mean it's a,ep116
963,good size it's not huge but that's okay,ep116
966,we are downsizing we can definitely fit,ep116
969,a king-sized bed in here and still have,ep116
972,a view and a nice big window so I,ep116
975,actually seen an attached bathroom there,ep116
978,is this is the master bath okay so I,ep116
981,like wood paneling but I don't even want,ep116
984,to say that this is wood I don't even,ep116
987,know what this is,ep116
990,that is a laminate treatment so it's,ep116
993,something that you would see on a floor,ep116
996,but they've put it on the wall what does,ep116
999,work is this vanity this floating vanity,ep116
1002,is actually,ep116
1005,it's something that I would keep and it,ep116
1008,has some extra storage here so that is,ep116
1011,good and then speaking of storage,ep116
1014,there's so okay this is the only closet,ep116
1017,then this is the only closet and in the,ep116
1020,bathroom and in the room good,ep116
1023,I I don't know what that fake wood,ep116
1026,paneling would have to go some of the,ep116
1029,things could stay but it is a little,ep116
1032,tight and then the closet is in the,ep116
1035,bathroom which I'm not a big fan of,ep116
1038,because if someone's using the sink then,ep116
1041,it's a little bit hard to get into the,ep116
1044,closet so here we have the shower but,ep116
1047,again there's that fake wood I think,ep116
1050,besides the fake what everything else,ep116
1053,looks pretty nice but yeah it just,ep116
1056,doesn't quite fit so what did you guys,ep116
1059,think of this home I love this courtyard,ep116
1062,this is probably my favorite feature I,ep116
1065,just love how it goes right into the,ep116
1068,kitchen area I think the big thing for,ep116
1071,me was that it didn't have the pool but,ep116
1074,maybe that's a good thing because we can,ep116
1077,design the pool how we want it the other,ep116
1080,thing is we can put our own personal,ep116
1083,touch on this we can come in and replace,ep116
1086,the floor put the floor that we like,ep116
1089,there's definitely room under the budget,ep116
1092,since this house is so cheap that's,ep116
1095,"right at $500,000 I do like the price of",ep116
1098,the house but how much is it gonna cost,ep116
1101,to get this all done to get it the way,ep116
1104,that we want it it is a fixer that is,ep116
1107,kind of an issue for me and I really,ep116
1110,don't want to complicate my life yeah,ep116
1113,but I don't see that as a problem I see,ep116
1116,it as a plus,ep116
1119,so Raquel lines up a more move-in-ready,ep116
1122,option for Gisella located in a unique,ep116
1125,neighborhood,ep116
1128,I love the tree-lined streets yeah it's,ep116
1131,great definitely a really,ep116
1134,well-established neighborhood,ep116
1137,[Music],ep116
1140,boy it's pretty nice and peaceful I hear,ep116
1143,oh it's so beautiful,ep116
1146,"Alejo and Gisela have $600,000 to spend",ep116
1149,on a house in Sacramento and they're set,ep116
1152,on finding the perfect mid-century,ep116
1155,modern to call home so far they've seen,ep116
1158,an updated home with a pool that was,ep116
1161,slightly outside their target area and a,ep116
1164,little over their budget then they saw a,ep116
1167,home with no pool in need of some work,ep116
1170,but with a lower price tag and much,ep116
1173,closer to downtown today the couple is,ep116
1176,looking at a home built by famed,ep116
1179,real-estate developer Joseph Eichler I,ep116
1182,love the tree-lined streets yeah it's,ep116
1185,great definitely a really,ep116
1188,well-established neighborhood,ep116
1191,Joseph Eifler in the 1950s started,ep116
1194,thinking outside the box instead of a,ep116
1197,traditional ranch-style home I wanted to,ep116
1200,add some modern tones and modern look to,ep116
1203,it well there's Raquel this must be the,ep116
1206,house right how are you great how are,ep116
1209,you you're gonna love what you see,ep116
1212,inside they tell us it is a four-bedroom,ep116
1215,two-bath 1714 square feet and it's,ep116
1218,listed at a great price at 539 900 this,ep116
1221,glass is amazing this is what,ep116
1224,mid-century modern living is all about,ep116
1227,it's about bringing the outdoors in this,ep116
1230,is perfect,ep116
1233,Wow what do you think of these beams I,ep116
1236,love them I love the built-in cabinets,ep116
1239,and I know I'm trying to get rid of my,ep116
1242,stuff but a little extra storage is,ep116
1245,always good I could see my 60-inch TV,ep116
1248,right here I can be sitting back here,ep116
1251,looking out to the backyard,ep116
1254,they could work nicely did you see this,ep116
1257,wall it has a really neat texture I,ep116
1260,think it's the burlap wallpaper that I,ep116
1263,used to put in homes in the 50s and 60s,ep116
1266,and it looks like it's been repainted,ep116
1269,but I love this texture next they see,ep116
1272,the kitchen pretty much this is moving,ep116
1275,ready and I actually really like that,ep116
1278,because I know with kitchen remodels,ep116
1281,it's so expensive it takes so much time,ep116
1284,and we don't have to do anything about,ep116
1287,the backsplash though it's not crazy,ep116
1290,about that I mean that's a project that,ep116
1293,you could do it's not really what I,ep116
1296,would have done I think I would have,ep116
1299,done things a little differently just to,ep116
1302,put my own stamp on the house so are you,ep116
1305,ready to take a look at the bedrooms,ep116
1308,yeah,ep116
1311,let's go so I'm a little disappointed by,ep116
1314,the size of the room it's pretty small,ep116
1317,it's smaller than what the kids have,ep116
1320,right now when you go into the bedrooms,ep116
1323,they're just small and dark so that's a,ep116
1326,little bit disappointing to me let's go,ep116
1329,on into the master suite there's more,ep116
1332,closets as we're going down the hallway,ep116
1335,that's nice yeah sure so what I like is,ep116
1338,that it's been recently updated so,ep116
1341,there's no renovation no remodel nothing,ep116
1344,I like that yeah but you know we're kind,ep116
1347,of used to having two sinks and I know,ep116
1350,you tend to lock up the sink in the,ep116
1353,morning when getting ready so I might be,ep116
1356,late to work,ep116
1359,I hope they catch up and I think that,ep116
1362,we'll make it work this is what it's all,ep116
1365,about this is impressive this is really,ep116
1368,nice it's about bringing the outdoors in,ep116
1371,and looking out onto this what kind of,ep116
1374,concerns me is that it's actually kind,ep116
1377,of tight and we were actually thinking,ep116
1380,about getting the king honestly I don't,ep116
1383,I don't care about the size just like,ep116
1386,this this is exactly what I was talking,ep116
1389,about yeah this is great I think you,ep116
1392,have this you'd probably never have to,ep116
1395,go on vacation again right now really,ep116
1398,nice,ep116
1401,[Music],ep116
1404,so electron gisela what did you think,ep116
1407,about this home well I definitely had a,ep116
1410,lot of stuff we wanted I loved the,ep116
1413,backyard and the open space that looks,ep116
1416,out to the backyard with all the windows,ep116
1419,pretty amazing but I kind of feel like,ep116
1422,this is somebody else's creation their,ep116
1425,style and I don't really have a lot of,ep116
1428,room to put my own stamp on it but one,ep116
1431,thing I'm not too happy with or the size,ep116
1434,of the rooms they're a little too small,ep116
1437,[Music],ep116
1440,with three mid-century homes to choose,ep116
1443,from it's going to come down to bedroom,ep116
1446,size proximity to town and whether or,ep116
1449,not they're willing to sacrifice a pool,ep116
1452,we have some really nice homes to choose,ep116
1455,from yeah three mid-century modern homes,ep116
1458,in Sacramento so that was really neat to,ep116
1461,see,ep116
1464,[Music],ep116
1467,"Alejo and Gisela have up to 600,000",ep116
1470,dollars to spend on a new home in,ep116
1473,Sacramento California they've seen,ep116
1476,several houses and the time has come to,ep116
1479,make a decision the first house they saw,ep116
1482,was about 11 miles from downtown was,ep116
1485,that 675 which is above budget and don't,ep116
1488,really like that as far as all the,ep116
1491,finishes that had on it they did an,ep116
1494,amazing job the house is beautiful,ep116
1497,everything was done I mean that kitchen,ep116
1500,was unbelievable with the quartz,ep116
1503,countertops and that really nice,ep116
1506,cabinetry so I did like that I did like,ep116
1509,the floor-to-ceiling windows the,ep116
1512,backyard was beautiful and remember that,ep116
1515,little casita that we could use that was,ep116
1518,a nice spot for a gentleman but it is,ep116
1521,super far for both of us the next option,ep116
1524,"was priced at $500,000 I think it was a",ep116
1527,great price and had a lot of room for,ep116
1530,improvement it had the four bedrooms,ep116
1533,also had that nice kitchen that had the,ep116
1536,sliding door going out to the courtyard,ep116
1539,and I'm really fearful that putting in a,ep116
1542,pool is gonna completely destroy the,ep116
1545,lush yard and then there's the eichler,ep116
1548,house for five hundred and forty,ep116
1551,thousand well the price was great I like,ep116
1554,that I like when you walk in you can see,ep116
1557,you know all the nice big windows and,ep116
1560,look out into the backyard that was,ep116
1563,incredible just feel like you're on,ep116
1566,vacation every single day what I didn't,ep116
1569,like about it though is the kitchen was,ep116
1572,a little small and the rooms felt a,ep116
1575,little small and I know that you wanted,ep116
1578,to fix her but it's move-in ready so,ep116
1581,which one will they choose,ep116
1584,[Music],ep116
1587,I know that the house that I have to,ep116
1590,have is I CRO home it has everything,ep116
1593,that I want the location is amazing,ep116
1596,it's probably five six miles away from,ep116
1599,work and I can you know ride my bike to,ep116
1602,work I think it's the one I think so do,ep116
1605,so let's call Raquel okay this fits,ep116
1608,perfectly in here oh there it is,ep116
1611,initially the price was at five forty,ep116
1614,which we thought was a little bit low,ep116
1617,because we've been shopping in the area,ep116
1620,for several months and there's been,ep116
1623,occasions where there's like over 20,ep116
1626,offers on the same home so we knew,ep116
1629,coming into this that we would have to,ep116
1632,go well above the asking which we did,ep116
1635,we ended up closing at six hundred forty,ep116
1638,five thousand this house was the perfect,ep116
1641,home for us it had the right amount of,ep116
1644,bedrooms it has room for the gym where,ep116
1647,do you think putting the treadmill right,ep116
1650,over here we can open the windows get,ep116
1653,some fresh air,ep116
1656,having a move-in-ready house was just,ep116
1659,perfect it was what I had always wanted,ep116
1662,there's just so much that fits here okay,ep116
1665,the last one putting your own stamp on a,ep116
1668,house doesn't mean that you have to,ep116
1671,totally get it you can repaint the walls,ep116
1674,or change the flooring and our bedroom,ep116
1677,and still call it your own okay this,ep116
1680,one's looking a little too peachy for me,ep116
1683,so far I've cut down on the commute a,ep116
1686,half hour going to work and a half hour,ep116
1689,going home so that means one hour more,ep116
1692,for a family time when I'm here I don't,ep116
1695,want to leave I feel at peace it's,ep116
1698,tranquil it's the good life,ep116
1701,you,ep116
12,[Music],ep117
15,I'm already starting to feel the island,ep117
18,vibe at home right,ep117
21,Lynette's quit her job and her son's off,ep117
24,to college so she's leaving California,ep117
27,to find her paradise on Grand Bahama,ep117
30,Island free and single I really want to,ep117
33,get back in touch with the adventurous,ep117
36,Lynette report Grand Bahama her local,ep117
39,friend Susan will be there to keep her,ep117
42,in check you want all this fancy stuff,ep117
45,but you also have to be able to afford,ep117
48,him I might be interested in going well,ep117
51,not really I would really like less less,ep117
54,worn and dingy uh that's not a good,ep117
57,business decision what does it cost to,ep117
60,air-condition this place I think Susan,ep117
63,needs to call in sick tomorrow,ep117
66,[Music],ep117
69,welcome how are you good thank you I was,ep117
72,born and raised in Lodi California but,ep117
75,I'm truly a risk taker I've lived and,ep117
78,traveled all over the world I lived in,ep117
81,Grand Bahama for a few years then moved,ep117
84,back to California to raise my son,ep117
87,now he's off to college and I've left a,ep117
90,relationship so I'm free and single and,ep117
93,looking forward to getting back to the,ep117
96,island because I love it I'm an active,ep117
99,and outdoorsy person but while I was in,ep117
102,California I got away from that a little,ep117
105,took a corporate job which is not really,ep117
108,my thing,ep117
111,so I'm moving back to the Bahamas and,ep117
114,I'm going to do my graphic arts awesome,ep117
117,and we're gonna get to do this together,ep117
120,she'll be reconnecting with old friends,ep117
123,Susan for guidance,ep117
126,she's very level-headed and I tend to,ep117
129,get a little bit I just want to do all,ep117
132,of the things I wasn't able to do when I,ep117
135,was here before I quit my job in,ep117
138,California to move to the Bahamas now,ep117
141,I'm gonna be living off of my savings I,ep117
144,want to look after all the things that,ep117
147,really make me feel happy I really want,ep117
150,to get back in touch with the,ep117
153,adventurous Lynette but there's a lot at,ep117
156,stake with my move because I'm starting,ep117
159,my own business that's freelance graphic,ep117
162,design so if that doesn't fly I'm in big,ep117
165,trouble,ep117
168,Grand Bahama is the Bahamas most,ep117
171,northern Island and it's the closest,ep117
174,major island to the US there are a lot,ep117
177,of reasons why people are drawn to,ep117
180,living on Grand Bahama no income tax no,ep117
183,property tax beautiful weather,ep117
186,all throughout the year and very,ep117
189,friendly people we've had a couple of,ep117
192,hurricanes and that damaged our economy,ep117
195,that presents an opportunity for,ep117
198,purchases and for renters alike what are,ep117
201,my aspirations I'm looking for a,ep117
204,three-bedroom or one to two bedrooms for,ep117
207,affordability we'll see and I really,ep117
210,wanted to be on the canal because I like,ep117
213,to stand up paddleboard I'm also looking,ep117
216,for a place that's bright and airy open,ep117
219,concept with a nice kitchen checks to,ep117
222,entertain I would love to have a nice,ep117
225,yard that has a lot of greenery and as,ep117
228,lush move-in-ready real nice so I don't,ep117
231,have to do anything with it though,ep117
234,and if it needs a little bit of work,ep117
237,it's not the worst thing slap a coat of,ep117
240,paint on there and good as new I didn't,ep117
243,come here to fix up a place Wow you also,ep117
246,want to be able to eat my budget is,ep117
249,"2,200 US dollars per month",ep117
252,however I might be interested in going,ep117
255,whether that's not really Lynette,ep117
258,brought her friend Susan most of the,ep117
261,time it's a good idea it's my job to,ep117
264,keep her in line she tends to get a,ep117
267,little out there and woowoo so I'm,ep117
270,keeping her you know on the straight and,ep117
273,narrow so let's see how this works out,ep117
276,enos starting a search by showing,ep117
279,Lynette a place on the water this fits,ep117
282,our wishlist but perhaps not the budget,ep117
285,this is the two beds,ep117
288,Chuba beautifully furnished but the best,ep117
291,part is this is canal font and beach fun,ep117
294,but it looks a little apartment complex,ep117
297,II so what are they asking for this,ep117
300,place the asking price is twenty-five,ep117
303,hundred US dollars trust me you're gonna,ep117
306,love it let's just go see it it scares,ep117
309,me but I will take a look yeah we'll,ep117
312,just be looking well here you are that,ep117
315,future is bright and open and it's quite,ep117
318,big but it might be a little bit too,ep117
321,white it doesn't have the stainless,ep117
324,steel that you wanted I feel like you,ep117
327,could do surgeries right here in this,ep117
330,countertop yeah I feel like I'd be,ep117
333,cleaning and scrubbing this place all,ep117
336,the time to keep it nice and clean,ep117
339,what is this I would feel like I am,ep117
342,walking into a business meeting that's,ep117
345,not a dining room table,ep117
348,it's a conference table I guess you're,ep117
351,wondering why I've gathered you all here,ep117
354,today it's to convince me why I should,ep117
357,take this place for twenty five hundred,ep117
360,US dollars just as your financial,ep117
363,advisor it's not a good business,ep117
366,decision as your real estate agent let,ep117
369,"me show you why you'll be paying $2,500",ep117
372,look at this living room big sigh okay,ep117
375,right,ep117
378,open concept just like you wanted this,ep117
381,is a very nice space I like it yeah this,ep117
384,is genuine leather it'd be really,ep117
387,expensive you had to buy it fun here is,ep117
390,the master bedroom with all the big,ep117
393,views that's gorgeous,ep117
396,that's for sure yeah I like the decor in,ep117
399,here these white floors are gonna show,ep117
402,everything I think you're gonna be,ep117
405,cleaning all the time it's gonna make,ep117
408,you crazy I think Susan needs to call in,ep117
411,sick tomorrow let's keep moving,ep117
414,here is the just throw yeah nice and,ep117
417,bright,ep117
420,build a little hotel like kind of,ep117
423,sterile and you know what the elevator,ep117
426,door is right outside the window that's,ep117
429,not gonna do it all no privacy,ep117
432,look at this you Wow this is a beautiful,ep117
435,view now I see why this is twenty five,ep117
438,hundred dollars a month,ep117
441,yeah this view is incredible but it it,ep117
444,feels like an apartment building I,ep117
447,really wanted to feel like a home okay,ep117
450,and the furnishings well the living room,ep117
453,was nice but the kitchen was a little,ep117
456,bit well,ep117
459,dated for that price I think you should,ep117
462,really be getting you know the most,ep117
465,modern things that dining room table was,ep117
468,really that's gotta go and it was really,ep117
471,just way over her budget honestly the,ep117
474,biggest challenge is Susan definitely,ep117
477,you want all this fancy stuff but you,ep117
480,also have to be able to afford him this,ep117
483,is awesome it's really right on the,ep117
486,water it is all yes but it's at the very,ep117
489,top of your budget I need to find a,ep117
492,place that makes me happy well you also,ep117
495,need to find a place that you can afford,ep117
498,[Music],ep117
501,so awesome to be back so much Lynette is,ep117
504,ready to make the switch to island life,ep117
507,but only with some help from her friends,ep117
510,Susan I met Susan when I was living here,ep117
513,before she was actually my massage,ep117
516,therapist we became friends and do a lot,ep117
519,of things together but I moved back to,ep117
522,California when my son was young but now,ep117
525,he's in college,ep117
528,emptiness Susan knows me well and that I,ep117
531,have a tendency to go big I'm a romantic,ep117
534,and so she knows that she needs to keep,ep117
537,me down to earth and focus on things,ep117
540,like my budget when Lynette left before,ep117
543,was kind of uh you know dark time for,ep117
546,all of us now I'm very happy that she's,ep117
549,back,ep117
552,it's a I'm happy to be back it's like a,ep117
555,new day you know new a new phase in her,ep117
558,life free and single it's very exciting,ep117
561,Cheers and that is a super fun we have,ep117
564,lots of fun together,ep117
567,we are definitely kindred spirits soul,ep117
570,sisters there you go boy that's so good,ep117
573,to be back mm-hmm,ep117
576,best margarita in the world I think that,ep117
579,though the way I can be of most help to,ep117
582,her is by keeping her reined in keep her,ep117
585,on her budget so she can stay here,ep117
588,and so we can have fun together get into,ep117
591,trouble get the trouble the first,ep117
594,apartments price is not what susan has,ep117
597,in mind asking prices went to 500 US,ep117
600,dollars I'm over my,ep117
603,but Lynette loves that it provides,ep117
606,access to the water at both the canal,ep117
609,and the beachfront so you get the best,ep117
612,of both worlds this is a beautiful view,ep117
615,"now I see why this is $2,500 a month",ep117
618,this is a transitional time in Lynette's,ep117
621,life she's just out of a relationship,ep117
624,her son has grown and moved out for that,ep117
627,price I think you should really be,ep117
630,getting you know the most modern things,ep117
633,honestly the biggest challenge is Susan,ep117
636,Freeport Grand Bahama my strategy for,ep117
639,the next house perhaps not being as,ep117
642,close to the beach so that the asking,ep117
645,price would be a little lower we just,ep117
648,went over the bridge I think that's,ep117
651,moving away from town would you go over,ep117
654,the bridge how far is it to the beach,ep117
657,look at that view but you know when we,ep117
660,were driving here we went over that,ep117
663,bridge and it does seem a little bit,ep117
666,further than I would like it feels a,ep117
669,little remote it's too bad and Tuvok,ep117
672,what are they asking for this please,ep117
675,asking 2200 u.s. dollar okay four months,ep117
678,right at the top of your budget I know,ep117
681,but it's beautiful I love the yellow,ep117
684,color it reminds me of the islands it's,ep117
687,bright and cheery I'm gonna have to be,ep117
690,dealing with your stress the whole time,ep117
693,we want to keep you reined in,ep117
696,I get that but I'm also looking for,ep117
699,place that meets my needs which is why I,ep117
702,came here you gotta eat I want to see it,ep117
705,it is brand-new and that's all of the,ep117
708,features that you want it all right look,ep117
711,at this face,ep117
714,I love it but look at the stainless,ep117
717,appliances that's exactly what I wanted,ep117
720,it's not a whole lot of storage though,ep117
723,in this place not sure it's worth the,ep117
726,extra $200 it is more to see look at,ep117
729,this giant living room,ep117
732,it is bright bright bright I like it I,ep117
735,could put an easel over here it'd be,ep117
738,perfect for my art so I gotta ask big,ep117
741,room I ceilings what does,ep117
744,to air-condition this place I've lived,ep117
747,here for many years and I've paid,ep117
750,summertime electric bills they can,ep117
753,really they can really get up there look,ep117
756,at this fabulous sparkling view you,ep117
759,asked for the canal deliver did you sure,ep117
762,didn't you know the rock star beautiful,ep117
765,it's a little bit noisy,ep117
768,it's gonna get on your nerves it might,ep117
771,get on my nerves a little bit that Susan,ep117
774,keeps saying I'm gonna be stressed out,ep117
777,master bedroom beautiful tray ceilings,ep117
780,Italian for anything so it's strange,ep117
783,that there's no doorway in the master,ep117
786,bedroom onto the patio but the view is,ep117
789,gorgeous isn't it it is not you you,ep117
792,should sure you should be able to access,ep117
795,it from the bedroom I really love it,ep117
798,it's on the canal I love the furnishing,ep117
801,in the living room nice and bright it's,ep117
804,new modern it is but it's at the very,ep117
807,top of your budget it's my job to keep,ep117
810,you in line I really I don't want you to,ep117
813,be anxious you know I didn't come all,ep117
816,this way to settle I need to find a,ep117
819,place that makes me happy well you also,ep117
822,need to find a place that you can afford,ep117
825,I just want to make sure that she's able,ep117
828,to stay within her budget,ep117
831,keep her cost down keep her life simple,ep117
834,that's my mission here I'm the budget,ep117
837,two thousand US dollars a month I would,ep117
840,really like less less worn and dingy but,ep117
843,all that stuff you can fix that with a,ep117
846,coat of paint that's exactly what she,ep117
849,wanted and it's a budget yeah but it's,ep117
852,not all about the budget puppy puppy,ep117
855,you're gonna be adopted in the search to,ep117
858,rediscover herself,ep117
861,Lynette is moving from California to,ep117
864,Grand Bahama Island while I was in,ep117
867,California I took a corporate job which,ep117
870,is not really my thing I'm a fine arts,ep117
873,artist at my heart so I'm passionate,ep117
876,about art and photography so I want to,ep117
879,get back in touch with my art and make a,ep117
882,living with it I'm gonna do my graphic,ep117
885,design illustration and photography yes,ep117
888,one of the ways I want to get involved,ep117
891,with the community on Grand Bahama is,ep117
894,taking photos of dogs at the Humane,ep117
897,Society so they can post them on their,ep117
900,social media and get them adopted okay,ep117
903,look pretty,ep117
906,Lynette's trusting her best friend Susan,ep117
909,to watch her budget for her she'll be,ep117
912,starting a new business it scares me but,ep117
915,I will take a look yeah we'll just be,ep117
918,"looking having to come up with 2,500 a",ep117
921,month it's really gonna be a stretch,ep117
924,this view is incredible but it it feels,ep117
927,like an apartment building and it was,ep117
930,really just way over her budget this is,ep117
933,about me and I need to be happy oh it's,ep117
936,really right on the water and what are,ep117
939,"they asking for this place often 2,200",ep117
942,US dollars per month right at the top of,ep117
945,your budget keep your life simple if I'm,ep117
948,missing here,ep117
951,it's not a whole lot of storage though,ep117
954,in this play,ep117
957,you know the biggest challenges Susan I,ep117
960,really love it,ep117
963,who's a good puppy you're a good puppy,ep117
966,who's a good boy you're a good boy next,ep117
969,inna is going to show Lynette another,ep117
972,property on the canal but this time the,ep117
975,price will hopefully satisfy Susan she's,ep117
978,no gonna find any place better for Less,ep117
981,so we are on the canal just like you,ep117
984,asked a few minutes to the beach it's,ep117
987,three bedrooms and three bathrooms but,ep117
990,what are they asking for that I'm the,ep117
993,budget two thousand US dollars a month,ep117
996,that's what I do so what's wrong with it,ep117
999,we'll give it a chance I think you'll,ep117
1002,like it nice entryway and look at this,ep117
1005,kitchen,ep117
1008,it's a little small maybe well it's not,ep117
1011,only you I love those subway tiles,ep117
1014,subway tiles are very popular right now,ep117
1017,brings a modern look together that's,ep117
1020,exactly what you wanted and it's under,ep117
1023,budget once you open the door it's like,ep117
1026,walking into a cave it's kind of dark,ep117
1029,and dingy well there is more to see so,ep117
1032,let's have a look at the living room,ep117
1035,oh yeah it's nice I really like that the,ep117
1038,bamboo flooring continues in here but,ep117
1041,I'm not a big fan of the Grandpa grandma,ep117
1044,chairs they're not really me any little,ep117
1047,things that you don't like about it can,ep117
1050,be fixed you're an artist you can put,ep117
1053,your creative stamp on it okay I'm so,ep117
1056,picky and look at this beautiful I,ep117
1059,deliver this is awesome I can just walk,ep117
1062,right out of the house and put my,ep117
1065,paddleboard in the canal and go we can,ep117
1068,just we can just paddle right out to the,ep117
1071,ocean the yard is beautiful it's really,ep117
1074,what I envisioned yeah you know just,ep117
1077,really a lot of park with that he nailed,ep117
1080,it on that and here is the master suite,ep117
1083,I like that it's furnished and includes,ep117
1086,everything but I'm just not feeling the,ep117
1089,wicker yeah when you're saving a couple,ep117
1092,hundred dollars every month I think it's,ep117
1095,easy to ignore that sort of thing and,ep117
1098,take a look at the master bath,ep117
1101,with jacuzzi tub okay it's kind of weird,ep117
1104,and what is this pole dancing in the,ep117
1107,bathroom you can practice by that I,ep117
1110,never had I like the location but some,ep117
1113,of us kind of dated like the furnishings,ep117
1116,the bamboo floors were fabulous I loved,ep117
1119,the bamboo but I'm not really sure about,ep117
1122,the wicker furnishings but all that,ep117
1125,stuff you can fix that with a coat of,ep117
1128,paint I don't think she really gets why,ep117
1131,I'm coming here I'm not here to renovate,ep117
1134,a place I'm here to move in and be happy,ep117
1137,and enjoy it but the best thing that I,ep117
1140,like about it is the price it's under,ep117
1143,budget yeah but it's not all about the,ep117
1146,budget I would really like less less,ep117
1149,worn and dingy well it'd be great if we,ep117
1152,could do that for the same price,ep117
1155,in your heart of hearts Lynette I think,ep117
1158,you know which apartment is for you I,ep117
1161,think you really have to consider that,ep117
1164,that is not my style I'm not ready for,ep117
1167,that well okay I love this weather here,ep117
1170,really makes me feel alive I'm ready to,ep117
1173,move in and start living my life Lynette,ep117
1176,finally has an empty nest back in,ep117
1179,California my son he's off to college,ep117
1182,and I've left a relationship so I'm free,ep117
1185,and single so she's leaving to live the,ep117
1188,island life on Grand Bahama that's,ep117
1191,awesome I want to look after all the,ep117
1194,things that really make me feel happy,ep117
1197,she'll need to watch her budget since,ep117
1200,she's starting her own business work the,ep117
1203,camera and more importantly her best,ep117
1206,friend Susan will have to approve gonna,ep117
1209,get to do this together it's my job to,ep117
1212,keep her in line she tends to get a,ep117
1215,little out there and keep it simple you,ep117
1218,know yeah no need my girl stressing out,ep117
1221,yeah I don't want to stress so what,ep117
1224,about that ocean view apartment I love,ep117
1227,that it has not only the ocean but the,ep117
1230,canal but the thing is it didn't feel,ep117
1233,like an apartment complex and that's not,ep117
1236,really what I envisioned here it doesn't,ep117
1239,have the stainless steel that you wanted,ep117
1242,that dining-room table was really that's,ep117
1245,gotta go for the price that they're,ep117
1248,asking which is over your budget you,ep117
1251,should have a little more of your wish,ep117
1254,list boxes ticked the modern canal house,ep117
1257,really spoke to me on so many levels,ep117
1260,beautiful I love it,ep117
1263,look at the stainless appliances that's,ep117
1266,exactly what I wanted,ep117
1269,well okay I think that you might not be,ep117
1272,happy at the end of the month if you're,ep117
1275,stressing about rent money so we have,ep117
1278,"the big yard house $2,000 is $200 under",ep117
1281,your budget I don't know if I want to,ep117
1284,move into a place that needs a lot of,ep117
1287,work go to paint here and there little,ep117
1290,love easy peasy,ep117
1293,it's under budget yeah but it's not all,ep117
1296,about the budget,ep117
1299,[Music],ep117
1302,we may want to just eliminate that,ep117
1305,really expensive one the ocean ocean,ep117
1308,view kind of reminded me of apartment,ep117
1311,life yeah I haven't lived like that in a,ep117
1314,long time and I'm not planning on going,ep117
1317,back not since college days yeah,ep117
1320,[Music],ep117
1323,the modern canal house it really speaks,ep117
1326,to me,ep117
1329,it's new airy this one is ready for me,ep117
1332,it's welcoming me well you know the big,ep117
1335,yard house was the only apartment that,ep117
1338,had three bedrooms so for the space and,ep117
1341,the savings I think you really have to,ep117
1344,consider that yeah it's under budget but,ep117
1347,I have a feeling I'd be spending a lot,ep117
1350,of money to fix it up that is not my,ep117
1353,style I'm not ready for that,ep117
1356,that's just stuff that you don't have to,ep117
1359,buy you know maybe in time with the,ep117
1362,savings on the low rent you could,ep117
1365,replace a few things in your heart of,ep117
1368,hearts Lynette I think you know which,ep117
1371,apartment is for you I think you're,ep117
1374,rubbing off on me a little bit I think,ep117
1377,you know me well enough that you're,ep117
1380,right I don't want to be stressed I want,ep117
1383,to be able to have fun and be relaxed,ep117
1386,yes I think I've made my decision to go,ep117
1389,with the big yard house good choice I,ep117
1392,totally see you there I think you're,ep117
1395,gonna be really happy there keep your,ep117
1398,life simple yeah awesome decision being,ep117

1410,[Applause],ep117
1413,sit boy I am so happy with my decision,ep117
1416,I've been really looking after the,ep117
1419,things I wanted to do for myself I said,ep117
1422,when I moved here I wasn't gonna get,ep117
1425,involved in another relationship but I,ep117
1428,have,ep117
1431,oh look at that screw his arms coming,ep117

1449,pineapple you like it so much that,ep117
1452,you're speechless but Susan was right,ep117
1455,about staying under budget because now I,ep117
1458,don't have that anxiety since I'm,ep117
1461,getting my business up and running I'm,ep117
1464,so happy with the one that I've give me,ep117
1467,thank you it's like a new Lynette you,ep117
1470,know that saying it's Betty in the,ep117
1473,Bahamas got slogan it is true,ep117
12,I like the open floor plan here Carla,ep118
15,and Miguel are hoping to find a deal on,ep118
18,a fixer in Los Angeles California we're,ep118
21,willing to pay to destroy the floors,ep118
24,take out the carpet paint the walls but,ep118
27,even a fixer will be hard to find in,ep118
30,"their $500,000 budget take it all in",ep118
33,[Music],ep118
36,this is more than just a fixer-upper,ep118
39,this is gonna require a lot of work for,ep118
42,the budget we're in right now and that's,ep118
45,what you're gonna find in Los Angeles,ep118
48,will it prove to be too much well that,ep118
51,might be a problem I see it a lot of,ep118
54,money on upgrades here sweat equity it's,ep118
57,a lot of sweating,ep118
60,[Music],ep118
63,there's a lot of burning I think we're,ep118
66,done I think we're done Christmas my,ep118
69,name is Carla this is my husband Miguel,ep118
72,I'm a recording producer and engineer,ep118
75,and I am a director of licensing for a,ep118
78,record label cool let's get a one more,ep118
81,time,ep118
84,we met at Berklee College of Music I was,ep118
87,working there as a tutor at the time I,ep118
90,was a student as well,ep118
93,and one day this lovely lady comes,ep118
96,walking in the door I I did the whole,ep118
99,pursuing I just flat out said I would,ep118
102,like for you to take me out to dinner,ep118
105,and so I did,ep118
108,we've been together for 12 years it,ep118
111,works out because he's very calm,ep118
114,collected and rational I am completely,ep118
117,opposite yeah okay after college Carla,ep118
120,and Miguel moved to the San Fernando,ep118
123,Valley in Los Angeles right now we live,ep118
126,in a townhouse it's a little bit under a,ep118
129,thousand square feet so it's small it's,ep118
132,tight it's tight I need a kitchen island,ep118
135,so rattly like especially with the,ep118
138,bathroom situation we knew it was a,ep118
141,starter home but I don't like that I,ep118
144,have shared walls I really just wanted a,ep118
147,single-family home that's how I grew up,ep118
150,I feel it's about time because prices,ep118
153,keep going up and I know there's not a,ep118
156,lot of inventory in the city I'm looking,ep118
159,for more of a traditional style so I,ep118
162,don't like the box feel of a modern home,ep118
165,I liked an a-frame and a porch just I,ep118
168,want it to be homey,ep118
171,but still modern I really like the,ep118
174,California ranch style with the clean,ep118
177,lines not too much decoration just,ep118
180,simple design I even I even don't mind,ep118
183,the boxy look of a house from the,ep118
186,outside,ep118
189,I like the bricks though I definitely,ep118
192,don't like the bricks all right I guess,ep118
195,we can compromise on that I just can't,ep118
198,stand breaks cuz it just it reminds me,ep118
201,of cold and sadness and just depression,ep118
204,if that makes any sense,ep118
207,I call it cozy I like Briggs we can,ep118
210,remove him I'm,ep118
213,say I would like three to four bedrooms,ep118
216,two bathrooms or more for sure I would,ep118
219,like to have a big updated kitchen,ep118
222,that's my dream and I would totally love,ep118
225,a pool because that means more party,ep118
228,central a/c would be ideal because one,ep118
231,of the bedrooms is definitely going to,ep118
234,become finally by dedicated studio I,ep118
237,mainly work from home and if it's not,ep118
240,cold in there then that's definitely a,ep118
243,problem and then also the space for for,ep118
246,the children,ep118
249,Panchito and Brutus there are babies,ep118
252,that's actually one of the reasons why,ep118
255,we want to move also to have a bigger,ep118
258,yard for them so they can run around a,ep118
261,cute boy another thing that's important,ep118
264,for me is the street if I feel like it's,ep118
267,gonna be a busy street or noisy -,ep118
270,deal-breaker for sure so with the price,ep118
273,they come with a price tag and that's,ep118
276,another thing rather than spending their,ep118
279,entire budget on something turnkey they,ep118
282,want to find a home for less and roll up,ep118
285,their sleeves our budget that we figured,ep118
288,out is five hundred thousand we're,ep118
291,willing to destroy the floors take out,ep118
294,the carpet paint the walls we're really,ep118
297,handy so we can do a lot of stuff and in,ep118
300,a way I'm I'm excited about something,ep118
303,like that because I can make it my own,ep118
306,from scratch to start their real-estate,ep118
309,agent has found a home that could put,ep118
312,their renovation skills to the test you,ep118
315,know what I really love the street well,ep118
318,it's quiet it's what I'm looking for I,ep118
321,think this might be it,ep118
324,we've got some traditional in it simple,ep118
327,design straight lines I like it I can't,ep118
330,stand the bricks,ep118
333,oh hey Miguel hey Kurt how's it going,ep118
336,hey Karla got a great house for you,ep118
339,3-bedroom 2bath traditional style house,ep118
342,"just under 1,300 square feet listed at",ep118
345,479 900 oh it's a little bit of a fixer,ep118
348,okay but the good news is it has a pool,ep118
351,oh that's something I'm excited to see,ep118
354,let's go have a look,ep118
357,alright guys let's come on in well as,ep118
360,you can see the house opens up into the,ep118
363,living room,ep118
366,alright this place has potential take it,ep118
369,all in Wow the carpets got it yes I mean,ep118
372,the whole wood paneled mirror situation,ep118
375,it's a little bit too much and this,ep118
378,yeah the pony wall you know what I would,ep118
381,do cut this off open this up that would,ep118
384,make the living room much bigger this,ep118
387,should be easy to do right that's,ep118
390,removing yeah like everything is easy if,ep118
393,you know how to do the house really has,ep118
396,a 70s feel to it for the budget you were,ep118
399,in right now that's what you're gonna,ep118
402,find in Los Angeles this is more than,ep118
405,just a fixer-upper this is gonna require,ep118
408,a lot of work what is that that is a,ep118
411,swamp cooler that uses humidity to cool,ep118
414,the air so that means no a/c it's not an,ep118
417,AC nice to me yes don't be an extra cost,ep118
420,but what's we won in the kitchen okay,ep118
423,what's up with this fridge right here,ep118
426,yeah I mean all of this has to go I see,ep118
429,a lot of money on upgrades here sweat,ep118
432,equity it's a lot of sweating oh I,ep118
435,wonder if it's a big kitchen with just,ep118
438,updates and this is clearly not it see,ep118
441,the thing is when you come out this way,ep118
444,you're supposed to have a plate of food,ep118
447,I don't know where to begin,ep118
450,[Music],ep118
453,what's happening to this house Wow,ep118
456,that's what I'm talking about this is,ep118
459,nice yeah true California living,ep118
462,that's really nice boy there's a lot of,ep118
465,space for the docks to run around and,ep118
468,luckily they can swim I'd really like,ep118
471,this part of the house yeah huge,ep118
474,backyard,ep118
477,they head inside and look at the laundry,ep118
480,room with attached bathroom before,ep118
483,making their way to the bedrooms okay,ep118
486,this is the second bedroom this has the,ep118
489,space for either my office or your,ep118
492,studio that's what I was thinking and,ep118
495,here is the master suite all right and,ep118
498,we fit our bed here I don't know,ep118
501,here is the second bathroom okay this is,ep118
504,bigger than what we have right now I,ep118
507,like the fact that there's a shower and,ep118
510,a separate tub mm-hmm but there's only,ep118
513,one sink so I can see us fighting over,ep118
516,space okay yeah I think this house needs,ep118
519,a lot of work yeah yeah I mean I see,ep118
522,potential in it we could really fix it,ep118
525,up and make it our own and the backyard,ep118
528,there's a lot of space there I don't,ep118
531,know guys I mean nothing about that,ep118
534,kitchen is what I wanted I know it's,ep118
537,under what we want to spend but they,ep118
540,would have to put a lot of money into,ep118
543,fixing it up I guess we would have to,ep118
546,really run the numbers and see if it,ep118
549,makes sense since Miguel and Carla are,ep118
552,concerned about costly renovations Kurt,ep118
555,shows them what a turnkey home costs,ep118
558,whoa Wow,ep118
561,outside of our price range,ep118
564,[Music],ep118
567,again yeah yeah ready to go already told,ep118
570,ya Los Angeles couple Karla and Miguel,ep118
573,"are hoping to use their $500,000 budget",ep118
576,to move from their town home to a,ep118
579,single-family fixer they've seen a,ep118
582,traditional home in a quiet neighborhood,ep118
585,with a pool and a nice-sized yard for,ep118
588,the dogs but the house may need more,ep118
591,renovation than they want to take on so,ep118
594,their agent Kurt has found a,ep118
597,move-in-ready home on the outskirts of,ep118
600,the city I brought you to the North San,ep118
603,Fernando Valley for two reasons one you,ep118
606,can get more land for your money and two,ep118
609,the house doesn't need a whole lot of,ep118
612,work as soon as I get some mix of styles,ep118
615,that can really tell what it is it's a,ep118
618,ranch-style okay okay the house was,ep118
621,originally built in 1905 and obviously,ep118
624,updated and added on so it's a little,ep118
627,bit of a mishmash four-bedroom two-bath,ep118
630,"just under 2,000 square feet Wow on half",ep118
633,an acre land that's amazing,ep118
636,what does half an acre of land cost,ep118
639,around here six hundred forty nine,ep118
642,thousand price range I know it's above,ep118
645,your budget but with the land I think,ep118
648,you're really gonna like it I see some,ep118
651,breaks you know I don't like look at,ep118
654,this yard seriously huge where do funny,ep118
657,yard this big in Los Angeles all right,ep118
660,guys let's come on in Wow,ep118
663,I like the open floor plan here I see,ep118
666,bricks it's a gas fireplace I see yes,ep118
669,fireplace I like it that's what I'm,ep118
672,talking about it feels cozy well they,ep118
675,can be painted hardwood flooring yes,ep118
678,dual pane windows which is,ep118
681,energy-efficient does have air,ep118
684,conditioning which is great oh oh that's,ep118
687,yeah that's a big plus for sure,ep118
690,I really like that the kitchen is very,ep118
693,open,ep118
696,I like the quartz countertops I like the,ep118
699,appliances are new and it's definitely,ep118
702,upgraded this house has some really nice,ep118
705,features that I like it's definitely,ep118
708,outside of our budget but we did have,ep118
711,some money saved up for updates so the,ep118
714,possibilities are there,ep118
717,[Music],ep118
720,your very own laundry room oh I see I,ep118
723,put them right next to each other come,ep118
726,on outside Wow,ep118
729,Wow that's huge seriously half an acre,ep118
732,you can put a pool a tennis court a play,ep118
735,area a dog run love this that's a dirt,ep118
738,yes it's a dirty mess escaping would,ep118
741,definitely be a lot of money to fix this,ep118
744,yeah back inside they see two bedrooms,ep118
747,on the first floor one with a large,ep118
750,walk-in closet oh wow I mean this could,ep118
753,be my studio and that this could be the,ep118
756,sample the sound is a benefit yeah,ep118
759,here's the first bathroom I'd have some,ep118
762,pop of color or something I like the,ep118
765,floors yeah good for like when you have,ep118
768,people over perfect on the second floor,ep118
771,they find another two bedrooms so this,ep118
774,is Ana master bedroom Wow there isn't,ep118
777,really a true master in here some of the,ep118
780,older houses when they were built didn't,ep118
783,have masters I say so they compensate by,ep118
786,putting a bathroom on the side,ep118
789,oh no this is a bathroom exactly right,ep118
792,there's so much counter space here we,ep118
795,wouldn't have to fight over the sink,ep118
798,anymore the shape of it though it's kind,ep118
801,of weird it looks like an attic right,ep118
804,yeah,ep118
807,[Music],ep118
810,what I think is really cool is the space,ep118
813,the kitchen and I really like the,ep118
816,laundry room yeah I do like the open,ep118
819,concept here on the ground floor,ep118
822,however the upstairs feels a little bit,ep118
825,cramped with the slanted ceilings if,ep118
828,anything else there's plenty of room,ep118
831,plenty of land you could if you wanted,ep118
834,to build another house or rental,ep118
837,property on this lot off set the,ep118
840,mortgage payment I was going to say,ep118
843,because it is overpriced for judo quite,ep118
846,a lot can you maybe show us some,ep118
849,properties that are a little bit closer,ep118
852,to our budget I'll see what I can do,ep118
855,since Carla and Miguel are concerned,ep118
858,about cost Kurt finds a house they may,ep118
861,be more comfortable with wow that sounds,ep118
864,really good yeah I'll talk about,ep118
867,[Music],ep118
870,you want to cut some zucchini your,ep118
873,Frenchie thought do you think you can,ep118
876,maybe move to the other side as you sure,ep118
879,fine Carla and Miguel have five hundred,ep118
882,thousand dollars to spend on a,ep118
885,single-family home in Los Angeles,ep118
888,they're very specific which is great but,ep118
891,in the Los Angeles market right now it's,ep118
894,tough to find a house in the price point,ep118
897,that they want so far they've seen a,ep118
900,traditional house with a pool that would,ep118
903,require extensive renovations then they,ep118
906,saw an updated ranch on a half acre but,ep118
909,it was way over budget so now Kurt is,ep118
912,lined up a home he thinks will satisfy,ep118
915,their styles and wallets this house is,ep118
918,in a very nice neighborhood a little bit,ep118
921,out of the way away from the trendy,ep118
924,restaurants and some guesses but it's a,ep118
927,three-bedroom two-bathroom California,ep118
930,"ranch built in 1952 just under 1,500",ep118
933,"square feet on just under a 7,000 square",ep118
936,foot lot yeah it's nice it's authentic,ep118
939,California ranch style yeah and I see no,ep118
942,breaks so I'm very happy about that no,ep118
945,bricks that's right I know you're,ep118
948,allergic to those and the good news is,ep118
951,it's just below your price point,ep118
954,"$450,000 Wow Wow",ep118
957,that sounds really good yes what I'm,ep118
960,talking about all right let's check it,ep118
963,out,ep118
966,oh wow uh-huh you've got the living room,ep118
969,right here this dining area two separate,ep118
972,yeah back here we've got a nice big,ep118
975,family room,ep118
978,pretty much original everything in here,ep118
981,when you see it sixty-five years with,ep118
984,the same owner Wow they kept this house,ep118
987,Christine I could see it's freshly,ep118
990,painted I just have to take this part,ep118
993,better yeah if you want to remove the,ep118
996,carpet the good news is check this out,ep118
999,over here yes this carpet has been,ep118
1002,covering this hardwood floor oh that's,ep118
1005,in pristine condition yeah and this runs,ep118
1008,through the whole house Wow you know,ep118
1011,kind of what's old is new again right,ep118
1014,let me show you the kitchen well it,ep118
1017,feels a bit like a time warp in here huh,ep118
1020,what decade are we in this looks like,ep118
1023,straight out of the 50s the stove is,ep118
1026,like an antique piece of art so this,ep118
1029,tells you recipes this is cool,ep118
1032,but I don't know about that green color,ep118
1035,you see green I see yellow oh yeah yeah,ep118
1038,for sure let's have a look into the,ep118
1041,laundry room and just past this is a,ep118
1044,bathroom mmm well then hope your problem,ep118
1047,yeah you'll have to go in sideways but,ep118
1050,the good news is - there's a door here,ep118
1053,that you can come in from the back patio,ep118
1056,come around this way well clearly this,ep118
1059,was an almost adds to the square footage,ep118
1062,of the house you can even put indoor,ep118
1065,furniture out of your own absolutely,ep118
1068,plenty of room for the daughter to play,ep118
1071,got a detached garage over here you,ep118
1074,could actually turn that into it either,ep118
1077,a guest bedroom or your studio yeah I,ep118
1080,guess this is the AC yeah you've got a,ep118
1083,newer air-conditioning that's really,ep118
1086,important yeah there's a lot of,ep118
1089,surprises in that backyard,ep118
1092,oh it goes all the way around yeah,ep118
1095,there's also a lot of space I could do,ep118
1098,some gardening I could make it pretty,ep118
1101,and I could sit on jitu having a lot of,ep118
1104,fun oh yeah look at all this space,ep118
1107,you could even put a pool in here I'm,ep118
1110,hearing a lot of places are we in a,ep118
1113,light path yeah there's a private,ep118
1116,airfield up a couple blocks away oh you,ep118
1119,could hear we're planes and planes and,ep118
1122,planes I don't even know how many,ep118
1125,airports are out there but it seems like,ep118
1128,50 so that's a lot of noise,ep118
1131,"what do you want for 500,000 back inside",ep118
1134,they see two guest bedrooms and the,ep118
1137,second bathroom there's potential to put,ep118
1140,a second sink but it is pretty narrow so,ep118
1143,it would still be cut on top of each,ep118
1146,other and this is the master bedroom,ep118
1149,wow this is nice and big yeah that's a,ep118
1152,good size yeah it was added on I can see,ep118
1155,her bed fitting here oh I like the,ep118
1158,closets and it was very bright there's,ep118
1161,actually a great house you showed us,ep118
1164,your cards there's a fairly new AC and,ep118
1167,the price is great yeah,ep118
1170,both of the bathrooms seem like they're,ep118
1173,really tight though I don't know if,ep118
1176,that's gonna be enough space for us it's,ep118
1179,a really nice backyard and I can see us,ep118
1182,hanging out here but what I don't like,ep118
1185,is that those planes yeah you're gonna,ep118
1188,hear a little bit know everything it's,ep118
1191,not an airplane you're gonna hear a,ep118
1194,freeway so I mean pick your poison what,ep118
1197,do you think about it yeah Carla and,ep118
1200,Miguel must now decide on whether they,ep118
1203,want to roll up their sleeves or stretch,ep118
1206,their budget,ep118
1209,like deal with this,ep118
1212,[Music],ep118
1215,okay Miguel we have a decision to make,ep118
1218,yeah Karla and Miguel have five hundred,ep118
1221,thousand dollars to spend on a,ep118
1224,single-family home after seeing a number,ep118
1227,of places it's time to decide so first,ep118
1230,we have the traditional house with a,ep118
1233,pool at 479 900 it is underneath our,ep118
1236,budget I feel like there's a lot of work,ep118
1239,to be done in that house,ep118
1242,we have to completely redo that kitchen,ep118
1245,I mean that pink yes yeah it has no a/c,ep118
1248,that would be a big expense on the,ep118
1251,upside my favorite things was to pool,ep118
1254,the backyard itself why it is yeah I,ep118
1257,like that neighborhood there's so much,ep118
1260,potential we can really make it our own,ep118
1263,and the budget would allow for that next,ep118
1266,is a ranch on a half acre listed at six,ep118
1269,hundred and forty nine thousand the,ep118
1272,price on that house is really high but,ep118
1275,considering the size of the land I mean,ep118
1278,here in California it has a lot of value,ep118
1281,there's so much potential to put in a,ep118
1284,pool to turn that detached garage into a,ep118
1287,studio or even into a rental property,ep118
1290,and make up for the difference that way,ep118
1293,that house was nice of all three houses,ep118
1296,that kitchen that's the best one we've,ep118
1299,seen yeah let's talk about the 50s,ep118
1302,California ranch house that one was at,ep118
1305,"450,000 way below our budget and it has",ep118
1308,central a/c already I mean I'm really,ep118
1311,glad that they updated the house I mean,ep118
1314,owners 65 years you walk in there and,ep118
1317,you feel like you're in the 50s,ep118
1320,I know it's below our budget but I'm,ep118
1323,concerned about the area I wasn't too,ep118
1326,fond about all the noise and the plains,ep118
1329,remember the plains yeah it's pretty,ep118
1332,noisy that's not really something you,ep118
1335,can change,ep118
1338,which one will they choose,ep118
1341,[Music],ep118
1344,yeah what are you thinking I'm thinking,ep118
1347,the house with the Pope,ep118
1350,yeah we can always update the house and,ep118
1353,make it look whatever we want whatever,ep118
1356,style we want it's under our budget,ep118
1359,yeah some cheats on birdie who will be,ep118
1362,very happy there so will we I have to,ep118
1365,agree that area is fantastic the street,ep118
1368,those are things you can't really change,ep118
1371,about a house it's time to call Kurt,ep118
1374,yeah put it enough let's do that I can't,ep118
1377,hold this for two logs so we're almost,ep118
1380,there leave you,ep118
1383,we're toss on the house about six weeks,ep118
1386,ago and we're gonna be moving in in,ep118
1389,about two weeks that's really nice the,ep118
1392,asking price was 479 nine hundred and we,ep118
1395,ended up getting it for four hundred and,ep118
1398,eighty five thousand I felt it my gut,ep118
1401,that this was our house so I was ready,ep118
1404,to give a little more now that we,ep118
1407,started to do the renovations it becomes,ep118
1410,more and more apparent that we can,ep118
1413,really make this place our own we,ep118
1416,started by changing out the entire,ep118
1419,electrical system the pony wall is gone,ep118
1422,the entire flooring was redone the,ep118
1425,brakes,ep118
1428,I've already researched how to get rid,ep118
1431,of them,ep118
1434,turns out they can come out pretty,ep118
1437,easily check out this house holy gift,ep118
1440,that's really cool I got my backyard,ep118
1443,that I wanted the pool I can see,ep118
1446,ourselves having a lot of parties it's,ep118
1449,so nice to have a friend of the pool the,ep118
1452,ASC that's gonna be something that we,ep118
1455,doing a little bit further down the line,ep118
1458,right now the winter's coming so we,ep118
1461,figured when I cut an ear right away,ep118
1464,we're redoing the guest bathroom as well,ep118
1467,as a master bathroom I've already chosen,ep118
1470,the vanity and I'm holding up the,ep118
1473,sleeves cuz I really love to do tile,ep118
1476,work and I did it in our previous home,ep118
1479,so I'm looking forward to doing that,ep118
1482,myself I finally got my own space for a,ep118
1485,recording studio and I'll even be able,ep118
1488,to put in a vocal booth I'm not looking,ep118
1491,forward to the kitchen because we're,ep118
1494,gonna be knocking down some walls you,ep118
1497,know rearranging some things probably,ep118
1500,something that we're gonna put,ep118
1503,for a few months so we couldn't recover,ep118
1506,financially emotionally and all other,ep118
1509,lease yeah we're gonna have to get,ep118
1512,takeout for a while so quiet this has,ep118
1515,been exactly what we've been looking for,ep118
1518,the dogs are loving it they have so much,ep118
1521,space now to run around finds okay yeah,ep118
1524,now that we have this house we have more,ep118
1527,space for maybe two kids or a new puppy,ep118
1530,yeah this is a really good idea honestly,ep118
1533,so far I have zero regrets and I don't,ep118
1536,think I will,ep118
12,[Music],ep119
15,Charles and Sandy have a comfortable,ep119
18,predictable life in Omaha Nebraska but,ep119
21,they're taking advantage of an,ep119
24,unexpected opportunity to live abroad in,ep119
27,Spain I was accepted into a program in,ep119
30,Barcelona it works great for you it's,ep119
33,close to just cool so you'll be there,ep119
36,I'll be here you'll be quiet he'll be,ep119
39,quiet all the time where he's going for,ep119
42,his PhD and she can immerse herself in,ep119
45,Barcelona's classic history and,ep119
48,architecture you go two blocks in and,ep119
51,it's from the 1300 I knew it would be,ep119
54,difficult I knew there would be,ep119
57,challenges this is what I wanted quite a,ep119
60,bit over budget we can make it work be,ep119
63,more money well not really rubber hits,ep119
66,the road the rubber hits the road,ep119
69,[Music],ep119
72,and take a look at the sailboat oh I,ep119
75,can't believe we're gonna live here,ep119
78,about five years ago,ep119
81,Charlie's kinda threw out this idea do,ep119
84,you want to live overseas okay and then,ep119
87,it became what if I got my PhD and we,ep119
90,went abroad it was so glad you talked me,ep119
93,into coming here,ep119
96,doing a PhD was something that I wanted,ep119
99,to make a change of careers and begin,ep119
102,teaching I knew it would be difficult,ep119
105,you know there would be challenges but I,ep119
108,knew that we could also overcome them,ep119
111,I'm gonna have to say bye-bye to 1990,ep119
114,I'm gonna get rid of you you know we,ep119
117,didn't need it for Omaha but I think,ep119
120,having smartphone here will be important,ep119
123,we both thought if we're gonna do this,ep119
126,let's do it somewhere in those feet I,ep119
129,was accepted into a program in Barcelona,ep119
132,when the acceptance letter came I,ep119
135,realized there's no backing out now this,ep119
138,was concrete rubber hits around the,ep119
141,rubber hits the road look at the marina,ep119
144,there you go two blocks in and it's from,ep119
147,the 1300s for both of us now really is,ep119
150,the best time to make this move our,ep119
153,children are grown enough that they're,ep119
156,on their own it is so diverse I mean,ep119
159,look at all the people out here my dad,ep119
162,left us some money enough for me to quit,ep119
165,my job and Charlie to go back to school,ep119
168,the carefree live your dream is my dad,ep119
171,and I need to channel that spirit let's,ep119
174,go live a new life let's go live a new,ep119
177,dream Barcelona is enjoying a boom,ep119
180,properties are disappearing within hours,ep119
183,the building's the architecture is,ep119
186,beautiful the Mediterranean lifestyle,ep119
189,with the cafes the palm trees that sort,ep119
192,of birds is what everybody loves about,ep119
195,Barcelona tourists visitors and people,ep119
198,that live here as well what do you need,ep119
201,we're looking for a two-bedroom place,ep119
204,okay three-bedroom you need three,ep119
207,bedrooms do you practice the sports and,ep119
210,it kind of needs an area to air out,ep119
213,kendo is a Japanese martial art in the,ep119
216,armor that you wear gets very sweaty so,ep119
219,it is a sport that requires some space,ep119
222,to air the equipment out I need a room,ep119
225,for the equipment or some outdoor space,ep119
228,would work as well right okay I really,ep119
231,have to have office space I mean being,ep119
234,close to the metro to go to school is,ep119
237,really important okay all right be in,ep119
240,the center of town that's important to,ep119
243,me Oh,ep119
246,history in the architecture we want a,ep119
249,good kitchen I always loved to cook so,ep119
252,yeah I love cooking ok can we cook we do,ep119
255,a lot of cooking in the house and what,ep119
258,kind of budget are we talking about a,ep119
261,thousand dollars a month we really have,ep119
264,to stay I know I know you're willing to,ep119
267,stretch it but it has to be thousand or,ep119
270,less three bedrooms thousand dollars a,ep119
273,month central location is going to be,ep119
276,very difficult but I will do my best,ep119
279,okay are you ready Joey,ep119
282,shall we go yes okay let's start,ep119
285,students usually have low budgets,ep119
288,whereas families are looking for a whole,ep119
291,set of different things Charlie's,ep119
294,priorities are a student's priorities,ep119
297,whereas Sandies are very different,ep119
300,Elaine begins the hunt about 15 minutes,ep119
303,from the city center house ones tight,ep119
306,living space will show sandy and Charles,ep119
309,what their budget can buy so this,ep119
312,neighborhood is called camp de Larbre,ep119
315,how far are we from the center pretty,ep119
318,close to the center oh yeah it's a sort,ep119
321,of quiet family kind of neighborhood you,ep119
324,have shops you have supermarkets and,ep119
327,what about to the university you would,ep119
330,have a journey of between 50 55 minutes,ep119
333,that's kind of a long ride so this is,ep119
336,the building here on the right okay and,ep119
339,what floor is it it's on the fifth floor,ep119
342,is there an elevator Janna is it okay,ep119
345,"how much is it it's $1,000 a month for",ep119
348,how many bedrooms you have one bedroom,ep119
351,one bedroom bedroom bedroom one bathroom,ep119
354,it's a compact space should there be a,ep119
357,place for me to study or set up a little,ep119
360,office you would probably have to find a,ep119
363,corner of their living area to do that I,ep119
366,mean really this I don't work I really,ep119
369,don't want a one-bedroom I don't know,ep119
372,how this is gonna work Charley can live,ep119
375,in a shoebox and be happy I need to have,ep119
378,a separate space so come in,ep119
381,this is your small laundry space here on,ep119
384,the left will you have your washing,ep119
387,machine and you hang out your washing to,ep119
390,dry we could put my Kindle stuff out,ep119
393,here okay so it's an outdoor space,ep119
396,already and then we continued through to,ep119
399,the kitchen,ep119
402,nice big gas stove nice big cutting area,ep119
405,it's got a window yes it's nice we got,ep119
408,light inside I'm you have a dishwasher,ep119
411,the fridge nice breeze is coming yeah,ep119
414,you have breakfast table oh it's got a,ep119
417,good bathroom that's a little small it,ep119
420,is a little small house a shower a,ep119
423,walk-in shower it comes with lots of,ep119
426,hair project yeah it's not bad,ep119
429,lease it's not one of those little tiny,ep119
432,capsule showers this is the,ep119
435,living/dining area okay this is good,ep119
438,it's a little small but I think we can,ep119
441,make this my office space that's gonna,ep119
444,be your office yeah I mean we got a,ep119
447,dining area here so if we clear this out,ep119
450,I get set a desk up and I could put my,ep119
453,office to study here so you'll be there,ep119
456,I'll be here you'll be quiet,ep119
459,remember it's a thousand dollars it fits,ep119
462,our budget so yeah the space we have,ep119
465,here is a little bit small so when I'm,ep119
468,doing some study where I need quiet I,ep119
471,could go into the bedroom kind of close,ep119
474,the door and close myself off so I can,ep119
477,work out here when I'm doing typing and,ep119
480,doing something that's a little bit less,ep119
483,study intensive you have a small Terrace,ep119
486,just good with a good breeze,ep119
489,Charlie would be fine with that his,ep119
492,motto is we'll make it work to me it's,ep119
495,not gonna make it work I need to be,ep119
498,happy in a space so this is the bedroom,ep119
501,not bad a little small,ep119
504,does have a window it's got a nice big,ep119
507,cupboard a lot of storage space you've,ep119
510,seen everything now yeah I like the,ep119
513,kitchen I like the gas stove it's got,ep119
516,two outdoor spaces so I have some space,ep119
519,for my Kindle stuff and I think I've got,ep119
522,some space for an office and maybe I,ep119
525,could put my office in the bedroom,ep119
528,sometimes so that you could have some oh,ep119
531,that was a cat race if you can figure,ep119
534,some,ep119
537,out that I could actually shut a door,ep119
540,then maybe we can think about that and,ep119
543,it's in the budget which is really,ep119
546,important for a thousand donors you know,ep119
549,it's a good apartment it is a good,ep119
552,apartment for you but not for me,ep119
555,sandy gets a suburban surprise how often,ep119
558,do you go into the city I would go into,ep119
561,the city a lot that's why I moved here,ep119
564,you got a beach here it's like Miami,ep119
567,Charles and Sandy Howell have left their,ep119
570,home in Omaha for a very different life,ep119
573,sandy sometimes says it's nice to get,ep119
576,out of the box well there's not much box,ep119
579,in Omaha to get out of there in,ep119
582,Barcelona where the weather's warm I,ep119
585,hope they get some bikes look at picnic,ep119
588,down here on the beach the architecture,ep119
591,is stunning and Charles can pick up,ep119
594,where his advanced education left off I,ep119
597,did a master's degree in economics I did,ep119
600,a master's in business I've always been,ep119
603,in school he said why don't we go look,ep119
606,overseas to find a place to go back to,ep119
609,school,ep119
612,and I said yes but while he's happy with,ep119
615,a student's life on a student's budget,ep119
618,sandy wants a different experience our,ep119
621,standards of living are a little bit,ep119
624,different my idea of camping is the,ep119
627,nearest three-star Hotel,ep119
630,this is kendo this is one of Charlie's,ep119
633,favorite passions I'm hoping I can use,ep119
636,this against him with thee I need this,ep119
639,face I need the outdoor space house ones,ep119
642,location just 15 minutes from Barcelona,ep119
645,Center works for Sandy pretty close to,ep119
648,the center and the metro is just two,ep119
651,minutes away and you have shops you have,ep119
654,supermarkets but it's cramped layout is,ep119
657,a problem it is a good apartment for you,ep119
660,but not for me maybe I could put my,ep119
663,office in the bedroom sometime so that,ep119
666,you could have some oh that was a case,ep119
669,if you can figure something out that I,ep119
672,could actually shut a door yeah then,ep119
675,maybe we can think about that it's a,ep119
678,little small it is a little small piece,ep119
681,is that one of those little tiny capsule,ep119
684,showers Elena's getting a little far out,ep119
687,of the city how far do we have to go I,ep119
690,found more space by coming further away,ep119
693,from Barcelona Teresa is an authentic,ep119
696,Spanish Catalan neighborhood and it's,ep119
699,very close to Charley's University so,ep119
702,this is the apartment,ep119
705,and it has a sort of little courtyard I,ep119
708,like it it's very old-world that's right,ep119
711,but how far away from the city it seems,ep119
714,quite a drive 35 minute train journey,ep119
717,it's not the 31st night a train journey,ep119
720,how about from the University fifteen,ep119
723,minutes for the university it's very,ep119
726,close to your University that's good,ep119
729,it's real close for you but that's a,ep119
732,long ways for me yes it is okay because,ep119
735,I really want to be in the city all the,ep119
738,time yeah I understand okay,ep119
741,the apartment has three bedrooms one,ep119
744,bathroom three bedrooms three dams we go,ep119
747,a night one is it office we can use one,ep119
750,as a guest room 900 square feet is a lot,ep119
753,of space give us a little bit of privacy,ep119
756,we needed it nice kitchen little balcony,ep119
759,okay good what is it red run $800 a,ep119
762,month that's great a month,ep119
765,saves us 200 a month in her budget 2400,ep119
768,a year we can do a lot with that money,ep119
771,yeah yeah I really hope that will keep,ep119
774,us in our plan yeah you know smiling so,ep119
777,here we are this is the living/dining,ep119
780,area it's a little dark what do you,ep119
783,think about the space itself yeah once I,ep119
786,mean there's plenty of space and you,ep119
789,have your little Terrace as well oh,ep119
792,that's nice sweet better be nice that,ep119
795,looks like a good size very quiet out,ep119
798,there it looks good kitchens just here,ep119
801,this is good what do you think,ep119
804,it'll be a little tight cooking but it's,ep119
807,got gas gas stove that's wonderful,ep119
810,you can cook I can prep cutting board I,ep119
813,test the washing machine in the kitchen,ep119
816,and the washing machine it's a little,ep119
819,bit different when kitchen cook can do,ep119
822,some whites it works as functionally,ep119
825,looks got everything but you're right,ep119
828,so here's the first bedroom this is nice,ep119
831,oh it's got a desk it does,ep119
834,did you say they all the furniture comes,ep119
837,with a place right yes it's fully,ep119
840,furnished,ep119
843,everything you see stays okay you got an,ep119
846,unsecured to bed so this one's yeah,ep119
849,that's not not huge but it's definitely,ep119
852,got enough space for women it's got a,ep119
855,window I guess of like get some air I,ep119
858,can shut the door you can shut the door,ep119
861,so this is the bathroom it's not bad,ep119
864,does have a capsule shower it does I,ep119
867,mean that's a wild about those I know I,ep119
870,feel claustrophobic yeah but it's better,ep119
873,than a bathtub with a handheld shower I,ep119
876,guess we can make me with it it's only,ep119
879,five minutes a day you're right save on,ep119
882,water bellows so shall we see the master,ep119
885,bedroom it's got more yellow so well,ep119
888,tell them to get you then she can go,ep119
891,away but it's a good size bed that's a,ep119
894,big good it's comfortable it's,ep119
897,comfortable I would have to say I'm a,ep119
900,little underwhelmed by the apartment,ep119
903,it's everything you wanted I know we can,ep119
906,make it I know we can make it our home,ep119
909,but still I'm out in the middle of the,ep119
912,suburbs I want to be downtown this is,ep119
915,nice spare bedroom this could be another,ep119
918,room for you could be another room for,ep119
921,me it could be a spare bedroom it could,ep119
924,be for your kendo stuff yeah we could I,ep119
927,don't know maintain yourself in here,ep119
930,it's got a window you can open it up so,ep119
933,here's the terrace oh this is nice,ep119
936,streets is not too bad it's a little,ep119
939,noisy but it is daytime hey so what's,ep119
942,the verdict,ep119
945,well I do think it's a little tight I,ep119
948,mean it's just room room room you're,ep119
951,right for a 9 Hertz square feet it kind,ep119
954,of feels a little a little cramped yeah,ep119
957,it's typically Spanish I had lots of,ep119
960,small rooms rather than open spaces and,ep119
963,that's what you have I know it's a,ep119
966,little bit farther from Barcelona than,ep119
969,you wanted to it's a lot further than I,ep119
972,want to be it's close to the University,ep119
975,it fits the budget $800 a month that's,ep119
978,really good,ep119
981,we have a room for an office we have a,ep119
984,room for my kendo stuff it works great,ep119
987,for you it's close to your school okay,ep119
990,well I have another one to show you,ep119
993,should we go yes let's go I think I,ep119
996,could push sandy a little bit on this,ep119
999,but I know they prefer partum moving,ep119
1002,over here was really the experience of,ep119
1005,being in Europe and experience of being,ep119
1008,in a big city,ep119
1011,is what I wanted this is what I'm,ep119
1014,looking for I think the two women have,ep119
1017,got together a little bit I'm more on,ep119
1020,sandy side excuse me sir excuse me maybe,ep119
1023,I can pick up some speed pick up some,ep119
1026,speed I've got a death grip on the,ep119
1029,handlebars and inheritance left by her,ep119
1032,late father is making it possible for,ep119
1035,sandy to leave her routine life in Omaha,ep119
1038,behind the life we had no maja was,ep119
1041,pretty predictable it's time to break,ep119
1044,out of my comfort zone and giving her,ep119
1047,husband Charles an opportunity he can't,ep119
1050,pass up doing a PhD was something that I,ep119
1053,wanted to make a change of him begin,ep119
1056,teaching I was accepted into a program,ep119
1059,in Barcelona I think I'll be able to get,ep119
1062,used to riding a bike you're taking the,ep119
1065,bus I really hope we can avoid having to,ep119
1068,get a car I don't want a car but his,ep119
1071,return to student life will leave sandy,ep119
1074,on her own most of the day Charlie's,ep119
1077,gonna need to realize this isn't all,ep119
1080,about him I might just be tagging along,ep119
1083,but he's gonna have to give me a little,ep119
1086,bit of what I need to house one is just,ep119
1089,15 minutes from Barcelona's Center and,ep119
1092,seems designed for overcrowding so,ep119
1095,you'll be there I'll be here and you'll,ep119
1098,be quiet house 2 offers more living,ep119
1101,space and a shorter commute to Charles's,ep119
1104,school it's like 15 minutes drive or,ep119
1107,train ride to the University but sandy,ep119
1110,gets stuck with a 35 minute Metro ride,ep119
1113,into the city I really want to be in the,ep119
1116,city all the time yeah I understand it,ep119
1119,comes in two hundred dollars under,ep119
1122,budget though and adds two bedrooms and,ep119
1125,more living space into the mix what does,ep119
1128,it render on 800 dollars a month that's,ep119
1131,great a month with house 3 Elaine brings,ep119
1134,the hunt out of the suburbs and back,ep119
1137,into one of central Barcelona's most,ep119
1140,popular districts right where sandy,ep119
1143,wants to be this flat is in the center,ep119
1146,of the Gaudi area this neighborhood is,ep119
1149,very idyllic sought-after area of,ep119
1152,Barcelona it's very difficult to find,ep119
1155,properties especially around the,ep119
1158,thousand dollar-a-month,ep119
1161,budget range so this is the Sham play,ep119
1164,area of Barcelona I love it you're right,ep119
1167,in the heart,ep119
1170,a beautiful Barcelona this is what I,ep119
1173,want this is what I'm looking for the,ep119
1176,apartment has two bedrooms oh that's,ep119
1179,good that's good so you have it stays,ep119
1182,for your office and then the office has,ep119
1185,a little balcony,ep119
1188,okay you have a terrace terrace so we,ep119
1191,get a place to put my kendo stuff yeah,ep119
1194,keep you happy,ep119
1197,very nice traditional touches but it's,ep119
1200,very practical light modern apartment as,ep119
1203,well wooden floor lots of storage space,ep119
1206,I'm a little bit worried ask about the,ep119
1209,prices this looks like a really nice,ep119
1212,"neighborhood the price is $1,200 an hour",ep119
1215,it is over but I think you will see a,ep119
1218,bit live there is one drawback it,ep119
1221,doesn't have an elevator so you'll get,ep119
1224,some good exercise but it is worth it,ep119
1227,when you get there okay okay shall we go,ep119
1230,and see yeah let's try this,ep119
1233,carry me I can sympathize with anybody's,ep119
1236,trying to take your budget if you can't,ep119
1239,afford it you can't afford it but I,ep119
1242,think here I'm more on in Sandy's side,ep119
1245,she's given up a lot and she needs the,ep119
1248,kind of lifestyle this apartment will,ep119
1251,give her here we are and you want to pay,ep119
1254,"$1,200 to come up the stairs every day I",ep119
1257,won't be home to bring that groceries up,ep119
1260,you know that's very true but isn't it,ep119
1263,worth it looks like a nice place this is,ep119
1266,beautiful you have your open plan,ep119

1458,it and you let me know what you'd like,ep119
1461,to do yeah that sounds like a good idea,ep119
1464,a father's gift a chance to live a dream,ep119
1467,and a very difficult decision we want,ep119
1470,something different we don't want to,ep119
1473,transition you want a clean break,ep119
1476,[Music],ep119

1491,all over town there's one two blocks,ep119
1494,away félicité apartment we could see,ep119
1497,this all the time Charles and Sandy are,ep119
1500,making the move to one of the world's,ep119
1503,most majestic cities I have always liked,ep119
1506,to travel and to see new things and,ep119
1509,learn new things but for him,ep119
1512,Barcelona is less about seeing than,ep119
1515,learning doing a PhD was something that,ep119
1518,I wanted to make a change and with,ep119
1521,University classes about to begin,ep119
1524,he and sandy need to find a home the,ep119
1527,hunt began with an apartment 15 minutes,ep119
1530,from Barcelona's bustling center they,ep119
1533,have one bedroom it's a compact space,ep119
1536,right on budget yeah so that's a,ep119
1539,positive it's small well I was having a,ep119
1542,mini meltdown I can't see us living,ep119
1545,there I think we can make this my office,ep119
1548,space if we clear this out I could study,ep119
1551,here you're gonna be five feet from me,ep119
1554,at all times so and then the free,ep119
1557,bedroom in the suburbs that was large,ep119
1560,and as Rory Oquendo it has a room for,ep119
1563,your office yeah it has some nice space,ep119
1566,is on your budget was really close to my,ep119
1569,school it was I would make a lot of,ep119
1572,friends there but it's not in the city,ep119
1575,let's talk about the two-bedroom in the,ep119
1578,city my dream okay I loved everything,ep119
1581,about it it was in the city this is a,ep119
1584,great kitchen don't forget how many,ep119
1587,stairs was it to walk 77 stairs every,ep119
1590,day right and it's $200 over budget it's,ep119
1593,a lot it is a lot,ep119
1596,[Music],ep119
1599,so let's talk about the one-bedroom okay,ep119
1602,really like that it is very practical,ep119
1605,Brett right on budget has a gas stove,ep119
1608,that's a little day it is a little,ep119
1611,cramped it is not gonna work for us,ep119
1614,you don't think so no you're gonna be,ep119
1617,hooked to my hip at all times one,ep119
1620,bedroom out one bedroom out one bedroom,ep119
1623,out all right got the two-bedroom in the,ep119
1626,city the one that I love the one that,ep119
1629,you love in the city it's in the city is,ep119
1632,not too far from the metro beautiful,ep119
1635,neighborhood had room for an office a,ep119
1638,nice Terrace was my dream it is his,ep119
1641,dream but it was over budget,ep119
1644,yeah we had the three-bedroom in the,ep119
1647,suburbs that was under budget,ep119
1650,I think being outside the suburbs a,ep119
1653,little bit will give you a real,ep119
1656,immersion into Spanish and make some,ep119
1659,friends we make friends it's very close,ep119
1662,to the University but you know I know,ep119
1665,you have your heart set on the city I,ep119
1668,know you think which way I'm leaning but,ep119
1671,I'm really leaning towards the suburbs,ep119
1674,sure I am it's gonna stay under budget,ep119
1677,it's just a 30 minute train ride into,ep119
1680,the city you're gonna be close to school,ep119
1683,you know I've been thinking about it and,ep119
1686,the suburbs really isn't what we want we,ep119
1689,want something different we don't want,ep119
1692,to transition we want a clean break a,ep119
1695,new life right I agree we're going,ep119
1698,through the budget and when I look at,ep119
1701,what we've got what we can give in I,ep119
1704,think based on what we have I think we,ep119
1707,can go over budget and live in the city,ep119
1710,I think we really can make it so you,ep119
1713,want to go to the city I think both of,ep119
1716,us would be happier there I know I think,ep119
1719,it's the choice your dad would want us,ep119
1722,to make yeah I'm home I think I was,ep119
1725,crazy and my dad I think I was living,ep119
1728,the dream and I'm in the city I'm living,ep119
1731,the dream I think it's the choices you,ep119
1734,make you sure you went to City yeah big,ep119
1737,cities the best choice okay,ep119
1740,that'd be great,ep119
1743,[Music],ep119

1773,like a tourist still my office works,ep119
1776,it's a little bit tight and,ep119

153,be surrounded by four girls here shortly,ep120
156,so I'm excited by that they've braved,ep120
159,the Phoenix summers for six years and,ep120
162,now they're looking for a summer,ep120
165,vacation home in Flagstaff Arizona,ep120
168,basically it's 115 and you drive two,ep120
171,hours north and it's 80 degrees and cool,ep120
174,we've decided to look in Flagstaff,ep120
177,because I spent all my summers growing,ep120
180,up there black staff is definitely a,ep120
183,child-friendly because just the outdoor,ep120
186,aspect of hiking biking swimming it's,ep120
189,always been a dream of mine to get my,ep120
192,own family up there and have my own,ep120
195,children experience what I got to,ep120
198,experience so for this home search what,ep120
201,do you think that's something more like,ep120
204,log cabin something that's up north on a,ep120
207,few acres huge logs that run to the,ep120
210,cabin it's something that's gonna be,ep120
213,really outdoorsy I want something that,ep120
216,when we walk through the door it feels,ep120
219,like home you mean like a real log cabin,ep120
222,or actual it's like a real log cabin off,ep120
225,the grid it'd be great okay okay I agree,ep120
228,with the rustic part but not,ep120
231,off-the-grid not logs but I'm looking,ep120
234,for something a little a little bit more,ep120
237,we need something a little bit more,ep120
240,modern yes even though we're looking for,ep120
243,a home that's rustic I think I'm gonna,ep120
246,need a kitchen that's been updated you,ep120
249,know granite countertops or marble,ep120
252,countertops upgraded cabinetry stainless,ep120
255,steel plans is,ep120
258,I like the feel of what I got to,ep120
261,experience in the summers as a child,ep120
264,we're looking for four bedrooms at,ep120
267,minimum because we absolutely want a,ep120
270,guest space for people to come up but,ep120
273,maybe even more because the more the,ep120
276,merrier we're probably looking somewhere,ep120
279,"around 3,500 square feet I need an",ep120
282,office if we're gonna be spending,ep120
285,summers up there I need a place to,ep120
288,actually work and continue to design,ep120
291,toys we want outdoor living something,ep120
294,with a nice backyard maybe even a DAC a,ep120
297,fire pit an outdoor grill they have a,ep120
300,max budget of 1.1 million dollars but,ep120
303,they disagree on what that budget should,ep120
306,get them I'm really looking for a,ep120
309,fixer-upper I really want to put my own,ep120
312,stamp everything they really want,ep120
315,something that's turnkey for us I would,ep120
318,like to get this done and ready and move,ep120
321,in and enjoy ourselves maybe we can meet,ep120
324,in the middle and find something that,ep120
327,needs a little bit of work okay we'll,ep120
330,see the family has traveled to Flagstaff,ep120
333,to meet their agent to start the hunt,ep120
336,it's not as rustic as I'd like the,ep120
339,exterior of this house is exactly what,ep120
342,I'm looking for not logs I am really,ep120
345,liking the stone and you know what I'm,ep120
348,also really liking is the flower boxes,ep120
351,underneath those windows that's pretty,ep120
354,"sweet it's got about 3,700 square feet",ep120
357,okay and listed at 1.1 million right at,ep120
360,the top of the budget let's look inside,ep120
363,oh wow I love all the wood in here that,ep120
366,actually does kind of give me a feeling,ep120
369,of the log cabin yeah it might be a,ep120
372,little too much wood for me though stone,ep120
375,fireplace which is great picks that like,ep120
378,stone from the outside and actually,ep120
381,brings it inside very cozy and it's huge,ep120
384,I can definitely see us having,ep120
387,Christmases and events here bring family,ep120
390,and friends in,ep120
393,I love the floor-to-ceiling windows and,ep120
396,the views of the trees great let's check,ep120
399,out the kitchen,ep120
402,I'm not a fan of this kitchen,ep120
405,the colors not working for me at all I,ep120
408,prefer a lighter color and another,ep120
411,strange feature is I'm not exactly sure,ep120
414,what the two different heights are and,ep120
417,then this piece in between I'd prefer,ep120
420,probably just see it all the same level,ep120
423,I'm right behind you there's a cool,ep120
426,little breakfast nook with some really,ep120
429,great Ren dos I like this nice round,ep120
432,table would sit here could look outside,ep120
435,in the mornings the views have your,ep120
438,coffee in the morning,ep120
441,the other thing I'm noticing is the,ep120
444,placement of the double oven seems a,ep120
447,little strange overall I think this,ep120
450,kitchen is gonna have to go total,ep120
453,renovation but as long as I'm renovating,ep120
456,I could probably do some reconfiguring a,ep120
459,huge renovation of the size you're,ep120
462,wanting is because way over budget,ep120
465,humming sorry please we'll see you guys,ep120
468,gonna love this dish wow look at this,ep120
471,view,ep120
474,this decks huge you can fit like eight,ep120
477,to ten Adirondack chairs on here easy I,ep120
480,can see us cooking s'mores or roasting,ep120
483,marshmallows here this is great this is,ep120
486,exactly what I'm looking for,ep120
489,oh wow at the ultimate barbecue,ep120
492,fireplace and refrigerator yeah this is,ep120
495,my type of barbecue the outdoor dining,ep120
498,room concept is really cool I'm looking,ep120
501,forward to spending my summers in,ep120
504,Flagstaff in the cooler weather and I,ep120
507,can't think of a better place to do it,ep120
510,than on that dock outside it's an,ep120
513,entertainers dream back inside they see,ep120
516,the master bedroom,ep120
519,Wow nice high ceilings yeah I like the,ep120
522,tongue-and-groove up there as well,ep120
525,here's a closet here uh-oh it's kind of,ep120
528,small,ep120
531,yeah actually another project your,ep120
534,clothes would fit in here yeah you could,ep120
537,go in the hall closet,ep120
540,I'd be no closet they see three more,ep120
543,bedrooms here's a great office space,ep120
546,Scott most is perfect for me okay,ep120
549,hopefully the desk can maybe come with,ep120
552,it I really like the desk closet closed,ep120
555,door this will say well upstairs is a,ep120
558,bonus loft space,ep120
561,oh and this is a great room especially,ep120
564,to hide all the toys and keep the girls,ep120
567,up here we got three bedrooms two baths,ep120
570,and a secret room Oh secret rooms Carrie,ep120
573,said where is the secret room you have,ep120
576,to find it oh oh something opens that's,ep120
579,exciting,ep120
582,oh wow this is amazing this is super,ep120
585,cool Amelia would love this what a great,ep120
588,room yeah two beds toys TV the secret,ep120
591,bunk bed,ep120
594,I built poised for a living there's,ep120
597,fantasy in my world and actually have a,ep120
600,seat room that I could give to my,ep120
603,daughter and her soon-to-be sister,ep120
606,[Music],ep120
609,[Applause],ep120
612,overall I thought it was a really great,ep120
615,house yeah what do you think I liked it,ep120
618,as well it had that cool secret rooms,ep120
621,The Lost space in the house I really,ep120
624,loved that deck space I could just see,ep120
627,our friends and family out there the,ep120
630,fire pit and the outdoor dining space,ep120
633,the only trouble I saw was some,ep120
636,renovations you want to do and we're at,ep120
639,our max budget here I want to put my,ep120
642,stamp on something even though this,ep120
645,house is great it's right at our budget,ep120
648,Plus Annie wants to do renovations as,ep120
651,well which would put us way over where,ep120
654,we need to be it doesn't really matter,ep120
657,which house we buy because no matter,ep120
660,what I'm gonna put my stamp on it so,ep120
663,Scott probably should get on board and,ep120
666,learn that by now about me only problem,ep120
669,I had is it wasn't as rustic on the,ep120
672,outside as it is on the inside so their,ep120
675,agent has found a true rustic cabin for,ep120
678,Scott it's a great log cabin it's a lot,ep120
681,of locks,ep120
684,[Music],ep120
687,you wanna hike in your sparkly shoes,ep120
690,yeah you like hiking in Flagstaff toy,ep120
693,makers Scott and Annie have a 1.1,ep120
696,million dollar budget to buy a vacation,ep120
699,home in Flagstaff Arizona,ep120
702,[Music],ep120
705,so far they've seen a modern mountain,ep120
708,home that appealed to Annie and had the,ep120
711,renovation potential she wants now their,ep120
714,agent Chad is found a home more in line,ep120
717,with Scott style it's a great log cabin,ep120
720,it's a lot of locks look at this porch I,ep120
723,love the rocking chairs it really is an,ep120
726,amazing house everything you guys are,ep120
729,"talking about it's 4,600 square feet",ep120
732,they can see it a beautiful log just,ep120
735,over half an acre it is a little bit,ep120
738,above your budget how much it's listed,ep120
741,right now 1.2 oh this is gonna be a,ep120
744,little bit above their budget but who,ep120
747,knows you know sometimes people are,ep120
750,willing to go a little bit above their,ep120
753,budget to find that perfect home tap,ep120
756,that's a little high it is a little high,ep120
759,but it's really awesome let's take a,ep120
762,look okay come on hey guys,ep120
765,Wow tall ceilings I really like the log,ep120
768,this is exactly what I'm looking for,ep120
771,kind of makes me feel like a kid again,ep120
774,it's like a it's like a log cabin when,ep120
777,you were building when you real so I'm,ep120
780,seeing all these logs and I didn't think,ep120
783,I was gonna like them but they're really,ep120
786,winning me over coming into this house I,ep120
789,didn't think that I wanted a log cabin,ep120
792,this house is log central but after,ep120
795,seeing it it's growing on me,ep120
798,it feels really nice from the living,ep120
801,space into the kitchen the gas cooktops,ep120
804,nice so I like this you know I had,ep120
807,though there's one thing I don't like,ep120
810,amongst the floor I knew it I knew it,ep120
813,was coming it so I think there'd be,ep120
816,something we'd change it up allows you,ep120
819,put your stamp on it one more thing to,ep120
822,fix at a small I'm still project,ep120
825,so in here they designed a little bit of,ep120
828,an office space for you this is an,ep120
831,office it's not gonna work for me,ep120
834,I need something that's kind of confined,ep120
837,with doors it's got a phone that I'm,ep120
840,gonna be on all the day and I don't want,ep120
843,anybody to actually interrupt me so oh,ep120
846,wow this is beautiful well this is the,ep120
849,outdoor space we want to live up here,ep120
852,with yeah this is what we're looking a,ep120
855,fire for sure,ep120
858,yeah views of the trees nice cool breeze,ep120
861,it's good yeah this is a view I could,ep120
864,wake up to every morning I really like,ep120
867,this house I think Annie's warming up to,ep120
870,it too which is great so maybe this is,ep120
873,something we can compromise on how do,ep120
876,our living on its finest that's for sure,ep120
879,back inside is the master bedroom yeah,ep120
882,more great ceilings love it a great,ep120
885,space got a lot of detail and got a,ep120
888,wonderful view and here's the master,ep120
891,bath,ep120
894,I like it it's open it's got two sinks,ep120
897,bathtub and look also girls shower um I,ep120
900,don't like it at all,ep120
903,it's gotta be gutted there's like really,ep120
906,nothing that I would even keep first of,ep120
909,all the countertops are too low for as,ep120
912,tall as I am,ep120
915,the countertops have to be replaced,ep120
918,fixtures are brass which is gross not my,ep120
921,style and the shower is full of slate,ep120
924,and all of it has to go basically they,ep120
927,check out the other first-floor bedroom,ep120
930,then head downstairs to the game room,ep120
933,this is fantastic this is the mountain,ep120
936,living I'm talking about yeah yeah I can,ep120
939,totally see the kids playing down here,ep120
942,bringing their friends that's great what,ep120
945,do you think about this kitchen I do,ep120
948,like having a second kitchen a great,ep120
951,view outside details I really like that,ep120
954,it's downstairs and it's got everything,ep120
957,so I love it down here but the one thing,ep120
960,I really don't like is this flooring the,ep120
963,flagstone there's a considerable amount,ep120
966,of it and that'd be pretty expensive,ep120
969,I'll be easy to clean water it's not the,ep120
972,easiest clean I think he had another,ep120
975,project they see two more bedrooms this,ep120
978,is a great space for kids Amelia would,ep120
981,enjoy this,ep120
984,I think this house checks on all my,ep120
987,boxes it's kind of room and space for us,ep120
990,to grow the acreage and of course it,ep120
993,looks like a log cabin I really didn't,ep120
996,want a rustic log cabin problem is the,ep120
999,budget and you want any renovations in,ep120
1002,this house on top of it there's a few,ep120
1005,things I'd like to change unless check,ep120
1008,and get us a better deal this this isn't,ep120
1011,gonna work for me getting a better deal,ep120
1014,might be in the cards,ep120
1017,wow that's great under budget under,ep120
1020,budget you get the first boom did they,ep120
1023,get everything you wanted let me get the,ep120
1026,second screen and daddy gets the last,ep120
1029,boat Scott and Annie are looking for a,ep120
1032,summer retreat in Flagstaff Arizona with,ep120
1035,a max budget of 1.1 million dollars so,ep120
1038,far they've seen a modern mountain,ep120
1041,retreat at the top of their budget it,ep120
1044,had a rustic wood interior and great,ep120
1047,outdoor space but needed renovation then,ep120
1050,they saw a log cabin that excited the,ep120
1053,kid in Scott but Annie didn't like the,ep120
1056,finishes and it was more than they,ep120
1059,wanted to spend it's a great house I,ep120
1062,love the rustic appeal in the wood,ep120
1065,detail you know it really looks like a,ep120
1068,lodge I'm really liking this I'm really,ep120
1071,looking for a home that reminds me of my,ep120
1074,childhood spending the time up here in,ep120
1077,Flagstaff and getting that Mountain vibe,ep120
1080,and this is definitely giving that to me,ep120
1083,it's not completely a log home it's not,ep120
1086,super rustic but just has that touch of,ep120
1089,it so this one here it's got a half acre,ep120
1092,in the bathroom just five bedroom four,ep120
1095,and a half bath the good part,ep120
1098,just below 1 million Wow that's great,ep120
1101,under budget under budget hey come on in,ep120
1104,guys right up here is the main living,ep120
1107,area this is nice staircase it's nice,ep120
1110,and big,ep120
1113,I like the tongue-and-groove ceiling as,ep120
1116,well huge fireplace,ep120
1119,yeah it's rustic gives us that cabin,ep120
1122,feel especially with the stones being,ep120
1125,offset it's unique I like it yeah one of,ep120
1128,the things I really appreciate about,ep120
1131,this is that it's,ep120
1134,total great room I like that it's,ep120
1137,completely open right over here to our,ep120
1140,right was an office space if you like,ep120
1143,this guy great looks like he's got,ep120
1146,pocket doors here that actually will,ep120
1149,close which gives me some privacy great,ep120
1152,windows though again another room,ep120
1155,quavering nose and right behind you,ep120
1158,Scott's the restroom for this office,ep120
1161,what do you think about the wall color,ep120
1164,though I definitely would paint it but,ep120
1167,then I'd never have believed the office,ep120
1170,I love this office because it's private,ep120
1173,and it's secluded it even had its own,ep120
1176,bathroom which is great wow I really,ep120
1179,like this kitchen look at these,ep120
1182,countertops is this concrete yep stained,ep120
1185,concrete this is unique especially with,ep120
1188,the green color and I'm liking it this,ep120
1191,is my type of cooktop though six burners,ep120
1194,gasps that's what we're looking for and,ep120
1197,of course the picture window looking out,ep120
1200,here at the trees poet and love doing,ep120
1203,dishes like that and I'll be doing the,ep120
1206,dishes so for me this kitchens kind of,ep120
1209,perfect,ep120
1212,I love the concrete counters I love the,ep120
1215,humongous refrigerator and I can see,ep120
1218,myself having parties there all the time,ep120
1221,you know overall I really love this,ep120
1224,kitchen I don't think I would do,ep120
1227,anything I'm really worried that Annie's,ep120
1230,not gonna like the fact that there's not,ep120
1233,much to do in this house to make it at,ep120
1236,her stamp in her own unique Flair oh wow,ep120

1251,very respectable players up here what,ep120
1254,about us how quiet do we need to be kind,ep120
1257,of quiet out here something to consider,ep120
1260,though especially with little kids I,ep120
1263,mean can't really exactly tell them to,ep120

1350,on my list overall I really liked it,ep120
1353,this house is perfect for me because,ep120
1356,it's got that rustic feel it's got that,ep120
1359,wood texture I really loved it as well,ep120
1362,especially the big open great room also,ep120
1365,that kitchen it was really great so cool,ep120
1368,also under budget Golf Course we're a,ep120
1371,loud family I really didn't like the,ep120
1374,stairs,ep120
1377,there's too many stairs I'm a little,ep120
1380,concerned with the kids you know another,ep120
1383,thing chad is this is pretty turnkey and,ep120
1386,I'm looking for a little bit of a,ep120
1389,project so now it's time to decide,ep120
1392,what's most important choosing a home,ep120
1395,with projects for Annie a log cabin for,ep120
1398,Scott or staying in budget so what do,ep120
1401,you think are we ready to make a,ep120
1404,decision I think we are,ep120
1407,[Music],ep120
1410,make yourself at home if I can help you,ep120
1413,out let me know okay Scott and Annie,ep120
1416,have a budget of 1.1 million dollars for,ep120
1419,a summer home in Flagstaff Arizona,ep120
1422,they've seen several options now it's,ep120
1425,time to decide big decision to make,ep120
1428,what do you think about that modern,ep120
1431,mountain home for 1.1 million I really,ep120
1434,love the exterior of that home it wasn't,ep120
1437,too rustic I had enough of that stone to,ep120
1440,give me that Mountain feeling that,ep120
1443,amazing secret room to plus the views,ep120
1446,outside were stunning dad I could,ep120
1449,totally see us entertaining on that the,ep120
1452,one thing that the house didn't need was,ep120
1455,a total kitchen overhaul that's a,ep120
1458,problem because it's at the top of our,ep120
1461,budget yeah,ep120
1464,what did you think about the luxurious,ep120
1467,like heaven for 1.2 million,ep120
1470,it's that log cabin style I'm looking,ep120
1473,for is luxurious had great curb appeal,ep120
1476,from the outside something I could,ep120
1479,easily see myself at how cool is that,ep120
1482,second kitchen and the game room great,ep120
1485,friend retaining on the downside they,ep120
1488,didn't really have the office I'm,ep120
1491,looking for it wasn't private was very,ep120
1494,open that kitchen did need to be,ep120
1497,renovated that would put us way over our,ep120
1500,budget,ep120
1503,what about that lunched at home for nine,ep120
1506,hundred thousand I really liked it it,ep120
1509,was like well within budget the kitchen,ep120
1512,was beautiful didn't need any work and,ep120
1515,that wine room and we could move right,ep120
1518,in that's true I did want to do some,ep120
1521,projects and the house just didn't have,ep120
1524,enough under budget that's true the,ep120
1527,other thing was the golf course I can,ep120
1530,just see us being a little bit too loud,ep120
1533,and causing a problem so what do you,ep120
1536,think are we ready to make a decision I,ep120
1539,think we are,ep120
1542,I think we should choose the modern,ep120
1545,mountain house yes awesome give me a,ep120
1548,great family home for us yeah it's not,ep120
1551,as rustic as I would like on the outside,ep120
1554,but on the inside it is there's nothing,ep120
1557,much about that house I didn't like I'm,ep120
1560,kind of looking forward to putting my,ep120
1563,spin on that house,ep120
1566,the total kitchen overhaul all the,ep120
1569,problem is I got to work on that price,ep120
1572,get the price down Chad's got to go to,ep120
1575,bat for us,ep120
1578,I agree or it's No Deal and you know,ep120
1581,what you didn't pick out your very own,ep120
1584,room we closed on the house about two,ep120
1587,weeks ago the house was listed for 1.1,ep120
1590,million dollars and Chad did a great job,ep120
1593,negotiating the price down to nine,ep120
1596,hundred and seventy thousand dollars,ep120
1599,rustic look on the inside isn't,ep120
1602,something I was too thrilled about with,ep120
1605,the wood floors and the wood walls and,ep120
1608,the wood ceilings but it's growing on me,ep120
1611,overall I really wanted to turnkey house,ep120
1614,something that we could move in just,ep120
1617,kind of not do anything we actually,ep120
1620,found that here besides the kitchen it's,ep120
1623,a perfect house we do a lighter,ep120
1626,countertop we'd get rid of this lip,ep120
1629,because we were able to negotiate the,ep120
1632,price down it made sense so that we,ep120
1635,could do it got on the kitchen we got,ep120
1638,the price we needed at the money for the,ep120
1641,renovations you push it open I think the,ep120
1644,secret room really played a part in the,ep120
1647,purchase of this house it was so unique,ep120
1650,so different in at the end of the day,ep120
1653,it's all about our family I had to,ep120
1656,choose one part that I liked best,ep120
1659,definitely the view from the house,ep120
1662,that's the whole point of us buying in,ep120
1665,Flagstaff was to get outside in the,ep120
1668,summer and just sort of you know,ep120
1671,unwind the deck 1 it's over yeah mommy,ep120
1674,and daddy can we come in hello welcome,ep120
1677,for us having a second home allows us to,ep120
1680,have balance in our lives to be able to,ep120
1683,have a home down in Phoenix and work and,ep120
1686,come up here to Flagstaff and play is,ep120
1689,this your Locke cabin,ep120
