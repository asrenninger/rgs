"235",714,"don't judge it by the curb appeal this","ep001"
"236",717,"house actually has a ton to offer and","ep001"

"246",747,"$100,000 to do whatever you want to this","ep001"

"1092",249,"Provincial type of home with the brick","ep003"
"1093",252,"exterior as far as the interior","ep003"
"1094",255,"decorating","ep003"

"1100",273,"it takes to stay in the Old Fourth Ward","ep003"

"1102",279,"push to get us into a single-family home","ep003"
"1103",282,"they're so expensive","ep003"
"1104",285,"I would love to have a more open type of","ep003"
"1105",288,"floor plan I'm not really into the open","ep003"
"1106",291,"floor plan concept because you walk in","ep003"
"1107",294,"everything is right there feels less","ep003"
"1108",297,"homey to me I would just add a little","ep003"
"1109",300,"sparkle to it to give it a more of that","ep003"
"1110",303,"clam bake or in the kitchen they both","ep003"
"1111",306,"want granite countertops and stainless","ep003"
"1112",309,"steel appliances but I like white bright","ep003"
"1113",312,"kitchens yeah I don't really like white","ep003"
"1114",315,"it's too stark to me if it could just be","ep003"
"1115",318,"the natural wood finish I love carpet","ep003"
"1116",321,"Jen likes hardwood floors I do it's easy","ep003"
"1117",324,"to clean but I'm the one always sleeping","ep003"

"1123",342,"never use the fireplace in this space it","ep003"
"1124",345,"looks really cute one thing they do","ep003"
"1125",348,"agree on is they prefer to stay near","ep003"
"1126",351,"downtown Atlanta if I can find something","ep003"
"1127",354,"here we would definitely try to stay put","ep003"
"1128",357,"first up is a condo in the 4th ward","ep003"
"1129",360,"their ideal area I like it it has that","ep003"

"1132",369,"the exterior for me on the outside it's","ep003"
"1133",372,"perfect","ep003"
"1134",375,"the only thing I like about it is","ep003"
"1135",378,"there's Sun break with this that's about","ep003"
"1136",381,"it it's not a single-family home like","ep003"
"1137",384,"what I want it I just want to walk","ep003"
"1138",387,"straight into a home not another","ep003"
"1139",390,"building with neighbors","ep003"
"1140",393,"Tania's gonna have to accept the fact","ep003"
"1141",396,"that trying to find a single-family home","ep003"
"1142",399,"in that price range and the city limits","ep003"
"1143",402,"is gonna be very challenging so this","ep003"
"1144",405,"even is actually a two-bedroom","ep003"
"1145",408,"two-bathroom unit $29,000 all right well","ep003"
"1146",411,"that's in my budget that's good yeah how","ep003"

"1157",444,"one and that many units over here have","ep003"
"1158",447,"that I like the fact that there are high","ep003"
"1159",450,"ceilings you know because it gives that","ep003"
"1160",453,"feeling of walking into a home although","ep003"
"1161",456,"this is a condo oh and I love this","ep003"
"1162",459,"fireplace brings a lot of charm I think","ep003"
"1163",462,"it limits how much furniture you can","ep003"
"1164",465,"actually put in here though the granite","ep003"
"1165",468,"is all right I hate the color this is a","ep003"
"1166",471,"very dark kitchen it is a dirty kitchen","ep003"

"1191",546,"however we do have a view right onto the","ep003"

"1195",558,"the carpets I wish that the hardwoods","ep003"

"2188",543,"so my thoughts are this could be easily","ep005"
"2189",546,"converted into a kitchenette and then","ep005"
"2190",549,"picture this as your living room okay I","ep005"
"2191",552,"know but this is not move-in-ready like","ep005"
"2192",555,"we're talking yeah but let's look in","ep005"
"2193",558,"here I mean it looks like a really nice","ep005"
"2194",561,"bedroom oh wow this is really nice I","ep005"
"2195",564,"don't love the basement in this house","ep005"
"2196",567,"for Leslie having to create a whole new","ep005"
"2197",570,"kitchen it would work it's just it's not","ep005"
"2198",573,"ideal oh wow although I like this space","ep005"
"2199",576,"I can do this we're good convert the bar","ep005"
"2200",579,"into a kitchen yeah I can make it work","ep005"
"2201",582,"absolutely they head upstairs to the","ep005"
"2202",585,"second floor to see an office for Dustin","ep005"
"2203",588,"and four more bedrooms for the kids this","ep005"
"2204",591,"bedroom is really cool a child's dream","ep005"
"2205",594,"yeah well I'd you could get his own","ep005"
"2206",597,"little sensory spaces Oh perfect yeah","ep005"
"2207",600,"like we could sleep down here have some","ep005"
"2208",603,"sensory room up there I think would be","ep005"
"2209",606,"perfect","ep005"
"2210",609,"this is a lot of house y'all yeah","ep005"
"2211",612,"[Applause]","ep005"
"2212",615,"well you know I really like the style I","ep005"
"2213",618,"love the port I really like the upstairs","ep005"
"2214",621,"all those bedrooms really more bedrooms","ep005"
"2215",624,"that we expected to get I think that","ep005"
"2216",627,"would be ideal","ep005"
"2217",630,"what about the basement we could change","ep005"
"2218",633,"that up we had two let's just gonna put","ep005"
"2219",636,"us over budget so now they're headed to","ep005"
"2220",639,"a less expensive home it's three 90999 I","ep005"
"2221",642,"like that a lot does that mean that","ep005"
"2222",645,"we're gonna have to do some work to it","ep005"
"2223",648,"yeah one of Lisa's top wishlist items on","ep005"
"2224",651,"her and her family's Georgia house hunt","ep005"
"2225",654,"is a place that has living quarters for","ep005"
"2226",657,"her sister Leslie so far they've seen a","ep005"
"2227",660,"house with a basement that could work","ep005"
"2228",663,"but needed renovations and while Lisa","ep005"
"2229",666,"liked the homes farmhouse look her","ep005"
"2230",669,"husband Dustin has another style in mind","ep005"
"2231",672,"now that is a good-looking house it's a","ep005"
"2232",675,"nice craftsman-style house has a lot of","ep005"
"2233",678,"really cool details I like that it's not","ep005"
"2234",681,"a farm house it doesn't have the big","ep005"
"2235",684,"wraparound porch this is definitely more","ep005"
"2236",687,"my house you're gonna love the price","ep005"
"2237",690,"it's three 90999 I like that a lot does","ep005"
"2238",693,"that mean that we're gonna have to do","ep005"
"2239",696,"some work to it there's a slight project","ep005"
"2240",699,"but why don't we head inside and you can","ep005"
"2241",702,"take a look all right this is great off","ep005"
"2242",705,"the entry is a formal dining room a den","ep005"
"2243",708,"and the entrance to the great room it's","ep005"
"2244",711,"like you can see all of nature from here","ep005"
"2245",714,"no pool and it's pretty steep so it","ep005"
"2246",717,"doesn't even look like we could pull it","ep005"
"2247",720,"in there but there is an HOA with a","ep005"
"2248",723,"community pool well we would love a pool","ep005"
"2249",726,"we also know that that's a big ask to","ep005"
"2250",729,"get everything that we're hoping for but","ep005"
"2251",732,"at least I can pack them up and we don't","ep005"
"2252",735,"have to go far to swim and spend our","ep005"
"2253",738,"summers in that pool the eatin area I","ep005"
"2254",741,"mean I feel like that would totally work","ep005"
"2255",744,"I mean it's really open like that I feel","ep005"
"2256",747,"like is a huge deal to have people to","ep005"
"2257",750,"see the kids while we're cooking in the","ep005"
"2258",753,"cabinets there they're quality they're","ep005"
"2259",756,"nice cabinets just they're not the gray","ep005"
"2260",759,"or the white it's the lighter colors","ep005"
"2261",762,"that I was hoping for well let me be","ep005"
"2262",765,"honest about the kitchen I mean it is","ep005"
"2263",768,"totally workable right but it's not what","ep005"
"2264",771,"I want","ep005"
"2265",774,"I wonder again at this price point it","ep005"
"2266",777,"definitely could paint maybe but that's","ep005"
"2267",780,"just one more thing we'd have to do next","ep005"
"2268",783,"to the kitchen is a possible office for","ep005"
"2269",786,"Dustin with a full bath I mean there's","ep005"
"2270",789,"no urinal in here but it's pretty good","ep005"
"2271",792,"[Music]","ep005"
"2272",795,"yeah they head upstairs to see the","ep005"
"2273",798,"bedrooms so this is the smallest of all","ep005"
"2274",801,"the bedrooms we could use this for","ep005"
"2275",804,"Centauri space really Jeff yeah I think","ep005"
"2276",807,"that's a good option","ep005"
"2277",810,"Oh double doors I like it spacious yeah","ep005"
"2278",813,"this is big on this floor are two more","ep005"
"2279",816,"full baths and three bedrooms for the","ep005"
"2280",819,"kids","ep005"
"2281",822,"I loved there were so many bedrooms","ep005"
"2282",825,"upstairs it just seemed like upstairs","ep005"
"2283",828,"was definitely a win for our family but","ep005"
"2284",831,"the basement might be another story this","ep005"
"2285",834,"is interesting do I sleep here huge","ep005"
"2286",837,"think about it this way it's 1,800","ep005"
"2287",840,"square feet nice finish it out any way","ep005"
"2288",843,"you'd like okay it's dubbed for a","ep005"
"2289",846,"bathroom and you could probably put a","ep005"
"2290",849,"kitchen in - I do like that I could make","ep005"
"2291",852,"it uniquely me this house is way under","ep005"
"2292",855,"budget and for the money that we can","ep005"
"2293",858,"save on that we could do a lot of work","ep005"
"2294",861,"the basement though and we need to do","ep005"
"2295",864,"everything we need to put in walls we","ep005"
"2296",867,"need to put in plumbing it's gonna be a","ep005"
"2297",870,"lot of work I am concerned about the","ep005"
"2298",873,"basement and Leslie space about how","ep005"
"2299",876,"we're gonna get everything done in a","ep005"
"2300",879,"timely manner so that we can all move in","ep005"
"2301",882,"together this yard is what I love about","ep005"
"2302",885,"this house the landscape is beautiful I","ep005"
"2303",888,"just wish there was more usable space","ep005"
"2304",891,"back here and maybe if there was room","ep005"
"2305",894,"for a pool or if there already was a","ep005"
"2306",897,"pool that'd be pretty awesome you've","ep005"
"2307",900,"definitely given us a lot to think about","ep005"
"2308",903,"cuz it is a great house like when you","ep005"
"2309",906,"look upstairs that there's all those","ep005"
"2310",909,"bedrooms yeah and the house is beautiful","ep005"
"2311",912,"it's definitely that Craftsman style I","ep005"
"2312",915,"love the colors but really like we","ep005"
"2313",918,"wanted a house that was as little work","ep005"
"2314",921,"as possible and even though it's way","ep005"
"2315",924,"under budget it's gonna take a lot of","ep005"
"2316",927,"money to get this we're up and running","ep005"
"2317",930,"the way we would like it so their agents","ep005"
"2318",933,"found a place that's a little more","ep005"
"2319",936,"move-in ready","ep005"
"2320",939,"but that comes at a price the seller","ep005"
"2321",942,"just reduced the price to 499 nine","ep005"
"2322",945,"that's the that reduced it to $4.99","ep005"
"2323",948,"budget","ep005"
"2324",951,"[Music]","ep005"
"2325",954,"one two three with a budget of 440","ep005"
"2326",957,"thousand dollars Dustin and Lisa are on","ep005"
"2327",960,"the hunt for a home that's big enough","ep005"
"2328",963,"for their family of six plus Lisa's","ep005"
"2329",966,"sister Leslie so far they've seen a","ep005"
"2330",969,"5,500 square foot farmhouse style place","ep005"
"2331",972,"for Lisa and a 4,200 square foot","ep005"
"2332",975,"craftsman for Dustin but neither home","ep005"
"2333",978,"had the pool they want for their kids","ep005"
"2334",981,"today they're seeing a colonial-style","ep005"
"2335",984,"home that's the biggest yet it's fifty","ep005"
"2336",987,"nine hundred square feet six bedrooms","ep005"
"2337",990,"six and a half bathrooms huge that's a","ep005"
"2338",993,"big house the seller just reduced the","ep005"
"2339",996,"price to $4.99 nine reduced it to $4.99","ep005"
"2340",999,"that is way over budget $4.99 is just","ep005"
"2341",1002,"way over what we were comfortable","ep005"
"2342",1005,"spending $60,000 is a lot of money and","ep005"
"2343",1008,"I've got a lot of kids that I need to","ep005"
"2344",1011,"feed typically I don't like to show my","ep005"
"2345",1014,"buyers properties that are above their","ep005"
"2346",1017,"budget but in this case there's probably","ep005"
"2347",1020,"a little bit of room for negotiations as","ep005"
"2348",1023,"long as the rent doesn't go up don't get","ep005"
"2349",1026,"your home it's not the Craftsman style","ep005"
"2350",1029,"that I was looking for right and it's","ep005"
"2351",1032,"not really a farmhouse style either but","ep005"
"2352",1035,"it does have a large enough front porch","ep005"
"2353",1038,"that you could put plenty of furniture","ep005"
"2354",1041,"out here it's not huge but it could work","ep005"
"2355",1044,"you can go throughout the whole house","ep005"
"2356",1047,"think that's beautiful","ep005"
"2357",1050,"to be honest though it's really not as","ep005"
"2358",1053,"grand as I would have thought it would","ep005"
"2359",1056,"be walking up to the house I mean it's a","ep005"
"2360",1059,"yeah off the entry is a large formal","ep005"
"2361",1062,"dining room and the great room area but","ep005"
"2362",1065,"what I love is the windows I mean it's","ep005"
"2363",1068,"like the whole wall is Windows well and","ep005"
"2364",1071,"it opens up right into the kitchen okay","ep005"
"2365",1074,"so the backsplash it's not painted","ep005"
"2366",1077,"cabinets it's not white but this faucet","ep005"
"2367",1080,"is really underwhelming I think I need","ep005"
"2368",1083,"to get you a faucet it is kind of rich","ep005"
"2369",1086,"people problems really thing that","ep005"
"2370",1089,"delivers fresh drinking water into my","ep005"
"2371",1092,"home is not","ep005"
"2372",1095,"but it's really not very nice it's like","ep005"
"2373",1098,"a lot of the house it's a big house and","ep005"
"2374",1101,"has a lot of space but some of the","ep005"
"2375",1104,"finishes are lacking here next to the","ep005"
"2376",1107,"kitchen is a screened-in porch and a","ep005"
"2377",1110,"possible office for Dustin with its own","ep005"
"2378",1113,"bathroom on the second floor they see","ep005"
"2379",1116,"the bedrooms for the kids each with its","ep005"
"2380",1119,"own bathroom and the master suites so","ep005"
"2381",1122,"there's a hallway and the master suite","ep005"
"2382",1125,"you have a double vanity this bathroom","ep005"
"2383",1128,"is gigantic this shower is huge but","ep005"
"2384",1131,"there's just it's nothing too overdone","ep005"
"2385",1134,"in here around the corner is a potential","ep005"
"2386",1137,"sensory area for their son Elijah honey","ep005"
"2387",1140,"yeah I think it'd be really cool just an","ep005"
"2388",1143,"away space for him sound machine maybe","ep005"
"2389",1146,"yeah","ep005"
"2390",1149,"next they head downstairs to check out","ep005"
"2391",1152,"the basement all right let's say this","ep005"
"2392",1155,"area is all about you girl all right so","ep005"
"2393",1158,"this is your bedroom okay awesome","ep005"
"2394",1161,"what about the wall colors down here","ep005"
"2395",1164,"nice job it's an easy fix the basement","ep005"
"2396",1167,"also has a big living area and a kitchen","ep005"
"2397",1170,"Wow a little much lime green not feeling","ep005"
"2398",1173,"it that's bold my first impression was","ep005"
"2399",1176,"WOW the color I'm not in love with the","ep005"
"2400",1179,"kitchen but I mean I probably could get","ep005"
"2401",1182,"it for that so the bathroom over here","ep005"
"2402",1185,"very spacious I think this is nice","ep005"
"2403",1188,"alright there's a bonus coming oh yeah I","ep005"
"2404",1191,"like bonuses","ep005"
"2405",1194,"hey this isn't just a pool this is like","ep005"
"2406",1197,"a style I really love there's a pool out","ep005"
"2407",1200,"the back we really wanted it just for","ep005"
"2408",1203,"our budget we didn't think that was","ep005"
"2409",1206,"gonna be a possibility I mean it's like","ep005"
"2410",1209,"more than we were even asking for which","ep005"
"2411",1212,"i think is why the price tag is more","ep005"
"2412",1215,"than we were even asking for I just","ep005"
"2413",1218,"think we have a lot to talk about","ep005"
"2414",1221,"because less this apartment it's it's","ep005"
"2415",1224,"complete you know like paint what it","ep005"
"2416",1227,"will paint you know that's fine","ep005"
"2417",1230,"the bedrooms are huge okay and also keep","ep005"
"2418",1233,"in mind the fixtures really weren't that","ep005"
"2419",1236,"nice and this pulls a kind of murky is","ep005"
"2420",1239,"not in the best shape I don't know what","ep005"
"2421",1242,"that's gonna cost to fix it it's a lot","ep005"
"2422",1245,"of added cost is it worth an extra","ep005"
"2423",1248,"$60,000 for a house that still doesn't","ep005"
"2424",1251,"have everything that we want yeah that's","ep005"
"2425",1254,"a little crazy and now after seeing","ep005"
"2426",1257,"several options none of them hitting all","ep005"
"2427",1260,"the points on the family's wish list","ep005"
"2428",1263,"it's time for Lisa and Dustin to make a","ep005"
"2429",1266,"decision these biscuits are awesome we","ep005"
"2430",1269,"have more serious things to talk about","ep005"
"2431",1272,"those in biscuit","ep005"
"2432",1275,"with a budget of 440 thousand dollars","ep005"
"2433",1278,"Dustin and Lisa have been looking to buy","ep005"
"2434",1281,"a large family home in Canton Georgia","ep005"
"2435",1284,"they've seen several options now it's","ep005"
"2436",1287,"decision time these biscuits are awesome","ep005"
"2437",1290,"I'm so excited about this right now I","ep005"
"2438",1293,"think we have more serious things to","ep005"
"2439",1296,"talk about though than this kid I love","ep005"
"2440",1299,"the farm because it had that huge porch","ep005"
"2441",1302,"it was beautiful","ep005"
"2442",1305,"yeah that's really wasn't my style but","ep005"
"2443",1308,"it was beautiful though I'll give you","ep005"
"2444",1311,"that","ep005"
"2445",1314,"the upstairs is perfect like I love that","ep005"
"2446",1317,"loft area for Elijah back in me his","ep005"
"2447",1320,"little escape you know the one thing","ep005"
"2448",1323,"about that farmhouse at 449 9 even","ep005"
"2449",1326,"though it's at the top of our budget","ep005"
"2450",1329,"there's not really a lot of changes we","ep005"
"2451",1332,"need to make to it I do think there are","ep005"
"2452",1335,"some major changes to that basement","ep005"
"2453",1338,"because there's not a kid chamber Leslie","ep005"
"2454",1341,"and we'd have to do a lot of work to","ep005"
"2455",1344,"that basement now I want to talk about","ep005"
"2456",1347,"that craftsman at 399 9 that was way","ep005"
"2457",1350,"under budget and it was a beautiful","ep005"
"2458",1353,"house it was really charming especially","ep005"
"2459",1356,"there's so many bedrooms upstairs like","ep005"
"2460",1359,"more than we you didn't even need the","ep005"
"2461",1362,"basement there like Leslie space we were","ep005"
"2462",1365,"not thinking oh let's go completely","ep005"
"2463",1368,"build something from scratch and that's","ep005"
"2464",1371,"what I would take in the house","ep005"
"2465",1374,"you know adding a urinal is a treat to","ep005"
"2466",1377,"you by guys but what about the colonial","ep005"
"2467",1380,"and 499,000 it was a lot of money it was","ep005"
"2468",1383,"way over budget I think that pool it's","ep005"
"2469",1386,"like it's exactly what we want but it's","ep005"
"2470",1389,"gonna take some work to even get it","ep005"
"2471",1392,"functional and we're some this is so","ep005"
"2472",1395,"over budget so to think about having to","ep005"
"2473",1398,"put more money in we definitely have to","ep005"
"2474",1401,"make the basement is crazy it's just a","ep005"
"2475",1404,"little thing but I'm worried that kinda","ep005"
"2476",1407,"so which one will they choose","ep005"
"2477",1410,"I think about everything that we need it","ep005"
"2478",1413,"seems like our quality of life like our","ep005"
"2479",1416,"day-to-day living would be best in that","ep005"
"2480",1419,"colonial you know what that colonial","ep005"
"2481",1422,"just has a room for everybody and you","ep005"
"2482",1425,"know really the things we don't like","ep005"
"2483",1428,"about the house or things that we can","ep005"
"2484",1431,"change over time so I think we're gonna","ep005"
"2485",1434,"have to call on Amy and see if she can","ep005"

"2915",1152,"colonial with a huge backyard for rich","ep006"

"2998",1401,"master so yeah no that's a really great","ep006"
"2999",1404,"idea","ep006"

"3004",1419,"work on for a long time that just makes","ep006"
"3005",1422,"it more homey to me so tell me what you","ep006"
"3006",1425,"guys think of this one I really love the","ep006"
"3007",1428,"front of the house I mean I just think","ep006"
"3008",1431,"it's so picturesque","ep006"
"3009",1434,"I like the budget this house is 125","ep006"
"3010",1437,"thousand dollars less than our max","ep006"
"3011",1440,"budget","ep006"
"3012",1443,"plus with all the projects that we would","ep006"
"3013",1446,"have to do I just feel like we would","ep006"
"3014",1449,"still equal our","ep006"
"3015",1452,"the very top of our budget and probably","ep006"
"3016",1455,"go over it but I like the project that's","ep006"
"3017",1458,"my favorite part","ep006"
"3018",1461,"Lauren could take this house and make it","ep006"
"3019",1464,"her own but nothing they have to do","ep006"
"3020",1467,"right away it's in move-in condition","ep006"
"3021",1470,"it's a big decision","ep006"
"3022",1473,"and there's lots to consider but","ep006"
"3023",1476,"ultimately the choice may come down to","ep006"
"3024",1479,"either Rich's large backyard or Lauren's","ep006"
"3025",1482,"white kitchen we need to make a decision","ep006"
"3026",1485,"soon","ep006"
"3027",1488,"[Music]","ep006"
"3028",1491,"as sweet as your mom is I'm sure she","ep006"
"3029",1494,"would love for us to eventually find our","ep006"
"3030",1497,"own place yeah rich and Lauren have up","ep006"
"3031",1500,"to four hundred and fifty thousand","ep006"
"3032",1503,"dollars to buy their first home in","ep006"
"3033",1506,"Richmond Virginia after seeing several","ep006"
"3034",1509,"options it's decision time what did you","ep006"
"3035",1512,"think of the remodeled Cape Cod at 3:34","ep006"
"3036",1515,"nine it was definitely my style and it","ep006"
"3037",1518,"was closer to the city and the kitchen","ep006"
"3038",1521,"was beautiful the master bath was shared","ep006"
"3039",1524,"and Hall oh yeah","ep006"
"3040",1527,"there's no garage and the yard was","ep006"
"3041",1530,"smaller than I would like so then we","ep006"
"3042",1533,"have the grand colonial at 450,000 time","ep006"
"3043",1536,"for our budget actually that's at the","ep006"
"3044",1539,"top of yours but it's way over mine but","ep006"
"3045",1542,"it does have a big yard and it's move-in","ep006"
"3046",1545,"ready","ep006"
"3047",1548,"there weren't any projects for me","ep006"
"3048",1551,"related you honestly speak that's like","ep006"
"3049",1554,"my dream house but it's so huge then we","ep006"
"3050",1557,"saw the the farmhouse yes which was the","ep006"
"3051",1560,"cheapest house at 325 yeah and it had","ep006"
"3052",1563,"all the room for projects but it's a lot","ep006"
"3053",1566,"of projects yeah I've got the cash to do","ep006"
"3054",1569,"it I really love the curb appeal porch","ep006"
"3055",1572,"the front porch was amazing I don't","ep006"
"3056",1575,"think that the house is big enough for","ep006"
"3057",1578,"us to grow into well we can't buy three","ep006"
"3058",1581,"houses so I'd be bad","ep006"
"3059",1584,"[Music]","ep006"
"3060",1587,"you know which one I really love the","ep006"
"3061",1590,"grand colonial I mean I really have my","ep006"
"3062",1593,"heart set on the farmhouse fixer-upper I","ep006"
"3063",1596,"just feel like it's too many projects if","ep006"
"3064",1599,"I'm being honest it was a little","ep006"
"3065",1602,"overwhelming I can't believe I'm saying","ep006"
"3066",1605,"this that look colonial is I think I","ep006"
"3067",1608,"think it's a right decision really in","ep006"
"3068",1611,"the end of the day it makes no sense","ep006"
"3069",1614,"okay","ep006"
"3070",1617,"all right let's do it let's do it okay","ep006"
"3071",1620,"you ready yeah we made it to Richmond","ep006"
"3072",1623,"and we're in the grand colonial we got","ep006"
"3073",1626,"the keys a little over a month ago and","ep006"
"3074",1629,"we moved in about three weeks ago see","ep006"
"3075",1632,"that's what I'm talking about","ep006"
"3076",1635,"it is really neat to be a homeowner I","ep006"
"3077",1638,"mean it's cool to come home to our own","ep006"
"3078",1641,"place that we don't have to share with","ep006"
"3079",1644,"anybody else","ep006"
"3080",1647,"growing up my friend's parents had","ep006"
"3081",1650,"houses like this my parents had house","ep006"
"3082",1653,"like this this is you know whatever when","ep006"
"3083",1656,"I thought of my forever home the list","ep006"
"3084",1659,"price was $450,000 and we offered it","ep006"
"3085",1662,"that this is over my budget but with all","ep006"
"3086",1665,"of the things for the most part being","ep006"
"3087",1668,"done it's okay I've started to realize","ep006"
"3088",1671,"that painting is actually quite enough","ep006"
"3089",1674,"of a project let's put some stuff on the","ep006"
"3090",1677,"stand great these things I've painted","ep006"

"3093",1686,"Lauren is in charge of that works okay","ep006"
"3094",1689,"that's good while this house wasn't my","ep006"
"3095",1692,"original choice in style it fit us best","ep006"

"3503",1152,"out just for the modern style that we","ep007"
"3504",1155,"want","ep007"
"3505",1158,"I feel like this doesn't make the cut","ep007"
"3506",1161,"but the price is right for this house","ep007"
"3507",1164,"four hundred thousand dollars so that","ep007"
"3508",1167,"gives us three hundred thousand to","ep007"

"3518",1197,"first floor so this main floor here is","ep007"
"3519",1200,"completely finished and it could be your","ep007"
"3520",1203,"master this is so weird","ep007"
"3521",1206,"it's a little odd the carpets kind of","ep007"
"3522",1209,"gross you wouldn't large this half bath","ep007"
"3523",1212,"here yeah yeah and there's another room","ep007"

"3525",1218,"office or you could just take out this","ep007"
"3526",1221,"wall this is good potential action yeah","ep007"
"3527",1224,"they look at another bonus area","ep007"
"3528",1227,"so you have a workshop or you can use","ep007"
"3529",1230,"this as an art studio","ep007"
"3530",1233,"I like this I dig it","ep007"
"3531",1236,"ceilings are a little low but it's","ep007"
"3532",1239,"alright it does a lot of potential I","ep007"
"3533",1242,"think we could you know the price is","ep007"
"3534",1245,"right you have room in our budget to","ep007"
"3535",1248,"really do something cool here it's on","ep007"
"3536",1251,"the water fair would love the yard small","ep007"
"3537",1254,"the house itself is little small one of","ep007"
"3538",1257,"the only other things too is that it's","ep007"
"3539",1260,"kind of far away from work so I might be","ep007"
"3540",1263,"a problem after seeing several options","ep007"
"3541",1266,"it's time for them to decide the choice","ep007"
"3542",1269,"may come down to whether the house needs","ep007"
"3543",1272,"renovation has a big yard or as close to","ep007"
"3544",1275,"their jobs downtown I got a big decision","ep007"
"3545",1278,"here bar owners Adam and Kaylee are","ep007"
"3546",1281,"looking for a home in Seattle with a","ep007"
"3547",1284,"budget of $700,000 they've seen several","ep007"
"3548",1287,"options and now it's time to decide all","ep007"
"3549",1290,"right so what did you think about the","ep007"
"3550",1293,"lost townhome I liked that it was newer","ep007"
"3551",1296,"construction it was nice that we didn't","ep007"
"3552",1299,"have to like do any renovations to it","ep007"
"3553",1302,"but there was no yard for bear was still","ep007"
"3554",1305,"in her budget price was five hundred","ep007"
"3555",1308,"ninety-eight thousand yeah but member","ep007"
"3556",1311,"the bedrooms upstairs were tiny but it","ep007"
"3557",1314,"was brand new you wouldn't have to do a","ep007"
"3558",1317,"thing it had that really awesome","ep007"
"3559",1320,"commercial space downstairs it had 12th","ep007"
"3560",1323,"up ceiling good point yeah and it was","ep007"
"3561",1326,"also just 15 minutes from their bar so","ep007"
"3562",1329,"what did you think about that commercial","ep007"
"3563",1332,"property that we saw this interesting","ep007"
"3564",1335,"and unique you're the mountains and a","ep007"
"3565",1338,"huge yard at 399 950 it was the least","ep007"
"3566",1341,"expensive we'd have to put so much money","ep007"
"3567",1344,"into it it's gonna be you know double","ep007"
"3568",1347,"that at the end the whole place is a gut","ep007"
"3569",1350,"check","ep007"
"3570",1353,"it's a giant project it's outside of the","ep007"
"3571",1356,"city so what'd you think about the house","ep007"
"3572",1359,"on the river price 400 thousand makes it","ep007"
"3573",1362,"right in your sweet spot definitely","ep007"
"3574",1365,"unique mperatures the furthest away","ep007"
"3575",1368,"backyard is so awesome bear would love","ep007"
"3576",1371,"that I'd have to do tons of work though","ep007"
"3577",1374,"there's no master bedroom the two","ep007"
"3578",1377,"bedrooms that they do have are really","ep007"
"3579",1380,"really tiny ribbon all the carpet that","ep007"
"3580",1383,"attack feel like you can really make a","ep007"
"3581",1386,"lot of noise seems like we have a pretty","ep007"
"3582",1389,"tough decision I feel that the","ep007"
"3583",1392,"commercial space it was pretty far away","ep007"
"3584",1395,"but maybe within reach although I don't","ep007"
"3585",1398,"want to do a ton of renovation as long","ep007"
"3586",1401,"as we don't have to spend all of our","ep007"
"3587",1404,"time doing it we could just make it the","ep007"
"3588",1407,"way we want it and it has more square","ep007"
"3589",1410,"footage and the I think the yard is","ep007"
"3590",1413,"better for bear too it's got more","ep007"
"3591",1416,"potential sounds like you guys made a","ep007"
"3592",1419,"decision yeah we're gonna do the","ep007"
"3593",1422,"commercial property get the keys","ep007"
"3594",1425,"ten weeks ago we haven't started any","ep007"

"3605",1458,"a lot of the work for us","ep007"
"3606",1461,"okay go get it I think the thing that","ep007"
"3607",1464,"really sold us was the price it was","ep007"
"3608",1467,"still pretty close to work","ep007"
"3609",1470,"I had the yard for bear which is really","ep007"
"3610",1473,"important for me what are we doing you","ep007"
"3611",1476,"know we compromised on that it's not the","ep007"
"3612",1479,"style that we want there's a lot of work","ep007"
"3613",1482,"that needs to be done but a home makes","ep007"
"3614",1485,"it worth it because in the end even","ep007"
"3615",1488,"though we have to wait a little while","ep007"
"3616",1491,"put the money into it you know we're","ep007"

"3731",306,"3,500 square feet it's so cute","ep008"
"3732",309,"at least three bedrooms are a must since","ep008"

"3752",369,"renovation that's a big difference","ep008"
"3753",372,"between Denise tonight the amount of","ep008"
"3754",375,"renovation that I'm comfortable with is","ep008"
"3755",378,"probably not more than 25 percent","ep008"
"3756",381,"they've set aside an additional 50 K for","ep008"
"3757",384,"Renault no more if we need to knock down","ep008"

"3760",393,"build a whole new house not okay first","ep008"
"3761",396,"up a lodge style house with a lot of","ep008"
"3762",399,"acreage hi guys how are you today it's","ep008"
"3763",402,"so pretty out here yeah I don't like it","ep008"
"3764",405,"that house look at the windows it's got","ep008"
"3765",408,"a craftsman door","ep008"
"3766",411,"it was on about five acres oh and it's","ep008"
"3767",414,"about 2700 square feet so it's a little","ep008"
"3768",417,"small it's a little small three bedrooms","ep008"
"3769",420,"three bathrooms","ep008"
"3770",423,"the price is 625 below your budget so","ep008"
"3771",426,"we've got some room all right here we go","ep008"
"3772",429,"you can see the moss rock fireplace","ep008"
"3773",432,"floor-to-ceiling wood ceiling wood","ep008"
"3774",435,"floors this entire wall is Windows great","ep008"
"3775",438,"view of Pikes Peak it's a little tight","ep008"
"3776",441,"then we're on top of the dining room so","ep008"
"3777",444,"down here we have a big family room area","ep008"
"3778",447,"another fireplace we also have a full","ep008"
"3779",450,"bathroom down here and then a walkout to","ep008"
"3780",453,"a nice patio with Pikes Peak views again","ep008"
"3781",456,"okay I could see myself in the studio in","ep008"
"3782",459,"here you would be fully contained in","ep008"
"3783",462,"here they head to the second floor to","ep008"
"3784",465,"see the other two bedrooms","ep008"
"3785",468,"kind of an oddly shaped room it is","ep008"
"3786",471,"there's two bedrooms and a bathroom in","ep008"
"3787",474,"between and so our vision of the master","ep008"
"3788",477,"suite retreat right right it would have","ep008"
"3789",480,"to be if all of this goes down and this","ep008"
"3790",483,"just becomes an open floor plan if you","ep008"
"3791",486,"do that and we make","ep008"
"3792",489,"[Music]","ep008"
"3793",492,"oh my god they see the Jack and Jill","ep008"
"3794",495,"bathroom this whole bathroom layout I","ep008"
"3795",498,"think it's we'd have to be rethought","ep008"
"3796",501,"yeah there's no master suite right to","ep008"
"3797",504,"this at all but there is another bedroom","ep008"
"3798",507,"here it's a little bit bigger because I","ep008"
"3799",510,"could possibly work as the master","ep008"
"3800",513,"bedroom this is a little bit bigger and","ep008"
"3801",516,"it also has another little deck out here","ep008"
"3802",519,"and you get Pikes Peak views from oh","ep008"
"3803",522,"yeah back downstairs they see the","ep008"
"3804",525,"kitchen","ep008"
"3805",528,"it is not a chef's kitchen it's just to","ep008"
"3806",531,"me it's just super small we would","ep008"
"3807",534,"probably want to blow out into this room","ep008"
"3808",537,"let's go look at this face this was","ep008"
"3809",540,"originally supposed to be the dining","ep008"
"3810",543,"room","ep008"
"3811",546,"so it's either I kept the formal dining","ep008"
"3812",549,"room or the big board maker arguing a","ep008"
"3813",552,"kitchen I can't have both off the","ep008"
"3814",555,"kitchen they see a full bath a laundry","ep008"
"3815",558,"room and an office you could possibly be","ep008"
"3816",561,"blown out maybe this could be your","ep008"
"3817",564,"master suite","ep008"
"3818",567,"and you have your own view which is","ep008"
"3819",570,"awesome again and there's plenty of room","ep008"
"3820",573,"out there to build on all right five","ep008"
"3821",576,"acres five acres yeah great","ep008"
"3822",579,"it's pretty private out here so we don't","ep008"
"3823",582,"have that tract home it's right feel","ep008"
"3824",585,"probably have to build some significant","ep008"
"3825",588,"decking right or create some venue space","ep008"
"3826",591,"out here but there's also a view of","ep008"
"3827",594,"Pikes Peak that is the quintessential","ep008"
"3828",597,"Colorado Springs view five acres sounds","ep008"
"3829",600,"fantastic but all five acres aren't","ep008"
"3830",603,"actually usable for us to have a venue","ep008"
"3831",606,"right now in its current state it's not","ep008"
"3832",609,"gonna meet our needs Kristi is very","ep008"
"3833",612,"practical and Denise really is very","ep008"
"3834",615,"visionary but I think the amount of","ep008"
"3835",618,"renovations are talking about a","ep008"
"3836",621,"realistic there's five acres and it's","ep008"
"3837",624,"definitely below our budget but as we","ep008"
"3838",627,"talked about right there's definitely","ep008"
"3839",630,"some significant renovation that we","ep008"
"3840",633,"would need to do that would bring","ep008"
"3841",636,"something over","ep008"
"3842",639,"also the kitchen is super small but the","ep008"
"3843",642,"views are and","ep008"
"3844",645,"stick so now they see a house with much","ep008"
"3845",648,"less renovation but no this isn't really","ep008"
"3846",651,"the kind of neighborhood you're talking","ep008"
"3847",654,"about right sidewalks houses are kind of","ep008"
"3848",657,"closed","ep008"
"3849",660,"[Music]","ep008"
"3850",663,"imagine what this looks like in the snow","ep008"
"3851",666,"I know","ep008"
"3852",669,"Christy and Denise are relocating from","ep008"
"3853",672,"Orange County California to Colorado","ep008"
"3854",675,"Springs and are looking for their dream","ep008"
"3855",678,"house within a budget of $700,000 so far","ep008"
"3856",681,"they've seen a well-priced lodge style","ep008"
"3857",684,"house it had Craftsman features five","ep008"
"3858",687,"acres and a view of Pikes Peak but the","ep008"
"3859",690,"house had only three bedrooms was under","ep008"
"3860",693,"3,000 square feet and they thought it","ep008"
"3861",696,"would need significant renovations so","ep008"
"3862",699,"now they're seeing a house their agent","ep008"
"3863",702,"thinks is more updated no this isn't","ep008"
"3864",705,"really the kind of neighborhood you're","ep008"
"3865",708,"talking about we're going sidewalks","ep008"
"3866",711,"houses are kind of close stucco that go","ep008"
"3867",714,"but I really want you to keep an open","ep008"
"3868",717,"mind and take a look at the house it's","ep008"
"3869",720,"listed at 660,000 it is five bedrooms","ep008"
"3870",723,"four bathrooms okay Wow lots of options","ep008"
"3871",726,"it's not really a mid-century modern","ep008"
"3872",729,"house like I'm looking for and certainly","ep008"
"3873",732,"not perhaps a craftsman that Christy is","ep008"
"3874",735,"looking for all right here we go all","ep008"
"3875",738,"right this is nice wow I love the open","ep008"
"3876",741,"floor plan it is just super open it's","ep008"
"3877",744,"wide open","ep008"
"3878",747,"but there's something about this kitchen","ep008"
"3879",750,"that makes it seems like there's a","ep008"
"3880",753,"kitchen inside someone's a lot of people","ep008"
"3881",756,"like that it's great for entertaining","ep008"
"3882",759,"yeah it doesn't have maybe a completely","ep008"
"3883",762,"formal dining room I would want to make","ep008"
"3884",765,"the fireplace you know like","ep008"
"3885",768,"floor-to-ceiling rockwork of Matt is our","ep008"
"3886",771,"track home fireplace at home right the","ep008"
"3887",774,"kitchen's nice and big I love the","ep008"
"3888",777,"stainless steel appliances um I do love","ep008"
"3889",780,"the granite countertops although it is","ep008"
"3890",783,"granite tile instead of slab it's a","ep008"
"3891",786,"little less expensive to do it this way","ep008"
"3892",789,"I think the cabinets are beautiful it's","ep008"
"3893",792,"not really my style but love the wood","ep008"
"3894",795,"and that view is everywhere from this","ep008"
"3895",798,"floor so that's definitely in line with","ep008"
"3896",801,"the wow factor that we're looking for","ep008"
"3897",804,"this kitchen is one of the bigger ones","ep008"
"3898",807,"that we've seen don't think we'd do any","ep008"
"3899",810,"renovating on it right away","ep008"
"3900",813,"but we could do something in the future","ep008"
"3901",816,"to make it just a little bit more my","ep008"
"3902",819,"style and here's a breakfast nook right","ep008"
"3903",822,"here and then flows right into our bar","ep008"
"3904",825,"we could set this up as our whiskey or","ep008"
"3905",828,"wine area all right so I think you're","ep008"
"3906",831,"gonna really like this oh wow this is","ep008"
"3907",834,"spectacular it is look at how glorious","ep008"
"3908",837,"there I'm not sure if it's gonna be big","ep008"
"3909",840,"enough for a venue space we want to have","ep008"
"3910",843,"an outdoor concert right might have to","ep008"
"3911",846,"actually move the fence right the","ep008"
"3912",849,"property goes down","ep008"
"3913",852,"remember it's half acre back inside they","ep008"
"3914",855,"see the master just room great views","ep008"
"3915",858,"again I love that little seating area","ep008"
"3916",861,"there right now we're in master bathroom","ep008"
"3917",864,"oh wow okay well this is a nice big","ep008"

"3920",873,"yes this is the walk-in closet walk-in","ep008"
"3921",876,"closets a-plus we would need to do some","ep008"
"3922",879,"pretty big cosmetic changes the space is","ep008"
"3923",882,"good yeah the space is really good they","ep008"
"3924",885,"head downstairs to look at two bedrooms","ep008"
"3925",888,"and a full bath before seeing the rec","ep008"
"3926",891,"room I love this space I would this is","ep008"
"3927",894,"where I would spend most of my time and","ep008"
"3928",897,"it just feels really nice it's got high","ep008"
"3929",900,"ceilings we've got the view so the only","ep008"
"3930",903,"other concern then is where we're gonna","ep008"
"3931",906,"put the studio space all right well this","ep008"
"3932",909,"is the idea that I have for that okay a","ep008"
"3933",912,"room here that is technically a bedroom","ep008"
"3934",915,"maybe I think the size is right let's","ep008"
"3935",918,"see what's in here oh yeah look at this","ep008"
"3936",921,"I mean this would be a great spot for","ep008"
"3937",924,"like a vocal booth or something just","ep008"
"3938",927,"right there definitely within our price","ep008"
"3939",930,"range","ep008"
"3940",933,"I did a good job on that plenty of room","ep008"
"3941",936,"for a studio maybe not so much room for","ep008"
"3942",939,"an outdoor venue for close proximity we","ep008"
"3943",942,"can see our neighbors so we're really","ep008"
"3944",945,"gonna have to sort of weigh the minimal","ep008"
"3945",948,"renovation yeah against thee it feels a","ep008"
"3946",951,"lot like where we came from but","ep008"
"3947",954,"fantastic yeah really from every room so","ep008"
"3948",957,"now they're headed to a house that won't","ep008"
"3949",960,"be short on character here's our","ep008"
"3950",963,"mid-century modern home Wow","ep008"

"3954",975,"aficionados Denise and Christie are","ep008"
"3955",978,"following their dream of moving to","ep008"
"3956",981,"Colorado Springs so they're looking for","ep008"
"3957",984,"a house in the area with a budget of","ep008"
"3958",987,"$700,000 so far they've seen a lodge","ep008"
"3959",990,"style house with the quirky character","ep008"
"3960",993,"they liked but it had no real master","ep008"
"3961",996,"suite then they saw a home that had a","ep008"
"3962",999,"large master and plenty of square","ep008"
"3963",1002,"footage but they felt the house was a","ep008"
"3964",1005,"little short on character and the lot","ep008"
"3965",1008,"was small so now they're heading to","ep008"
"3966",1011,"another option the house we're gonna be","ep008"
"3967",1014,"seeing today is in the mid-century","ep008"
"3968",1017,"modern style perfect five bathrooms four","ep008"
"3969",1020,"bedrooms priced a little above your","ep008"
"3970",1023,"budget at seven hundred and forty","ep008"
"3971",1026,"thousand seven there's three point six","ep008"
"3972",1029,"acres here Wow a mid-century modern","ep008"
"3973",1032,"house in the middle of this rustic area","ep008"
"3974",1035,"in Colorado with all this land I'm not","ep008"

"3976",1041,"the boulders I love how all of the","ep008"
"3977",1044,"outdoor elements are tied to all right","ep008"
"3978",1047,"here we go","ep008"
"3979",1050,"see what you think Wow look at that view","ep008"
"3980",1053,"oh my gosh this is the wow factor I was","ep008"
"3981",1056,"talking look at the beams look at the","ep008"
"3982",1059,"floor I love this original slate this","ep008"
"3983",1062,"would be our dining room and that's our","ep008"
"3984",1065,"living room this is obviously what they","ep008"
"3985",1068,"had used as the dining room you can see","ep008"
"3986",1071,"the chandelier so there's no like formal","ep008"
"3987",1074,"dining room that's its own room no not","ep008"
"3988",1077,"in this home and you could imagine this","ep008"
"3989",1080,"could be our whiskey station that'd be","ep008"

"3991",1086,"awesome bar area the floor though this","ep008"
"3992",1089,"is definitely gonna have to go this is","ep008"
"3993",1092,"not authentic to the house the big pain","ep008"

"4000",1113,"square feet of outdoor living space gosh","ep008"

"4004",1125,"venue that'll be so beautiful at night","ep008"
"4005",1128,"so one of the nice things about being in","ep008"

"4012",1149,"the countertops are yeah I'm not even","ep008"
"4013",1152,"sure what that is and it is a big","ep008"
"4014",1155,"freaking counter space in addition to","ep008"
"4015",1158,"all that you want commercial grade","ep008"
"4016",1161,"appliances so 25% renovation they take a","ep008"
"4017",1164,"peek at a bedroom that has an attached","ep008"
"4018",1167,"bath another bathroom and a small","ep008"
"4019",1170,"bedroom before seeing the master this is","ep008"
"4020",1173,"not even big enough to be a master but","ep008"
"4021",1176,"what if we took this out mm-hmm and","ep008"
"4022",1179,"combined it with the bedroom all right","ep008"

"4562",1254,"there that's the real room a real","ep009"
"4563",1257,"farmhouse appeals that I really like the","ep009"

"4569",1275,"where's the fireplace it's missing a","ep009"
"4570",1278,"fireplace and that's a big drawback that","ep009"
"4571",1281,"kitchen I look everything about it the","ep009"
"4572",1284,"only thing I didn't was those cabinet","ep009"
"4573",1287,"colors I really want my white cabinets","ep009"
"4574",1290,"that backyard was very very small and it","ep009"
"4575",1293,"faces north so you're not going to get","ep009"
"4576",1296,"Sun in the afternoon and certainly no","ep009"
"4577",1299,"sunsets","ep009"
"4578",1302,"there's the cows and then as cemeteries","ep009"

"4580",1308,"neighbor isn't gonna be quiet right can","ep009"
"4581",1311,"only hope and since all the homes are","ep009"
"4582",1314,"priced below their max budget they'll","ep009"
"4583",1317,"choose what's most important a garage a","ep009"
"4584",1320,"fireplace or those mountain views I love","ep009"
"4585",1323,"that view I'm gonna go with your famous","ep009"
"4586",1326,"lemon blueberry escape awesome that's a","ep009"
"4587",1329,"good choice penny and Tom are also","ep009"
"4588",1332,"hoping to make a good choice when it","ep009"
"4589",1335,"comes to buying their new home in","ep009"
"4590",1338,"Sevierville Tennessee they've seen their","ep009"
"4591",1341,"options now it's time to decide what","ep009"
"4592",1344,"about that new build traditional for 195","ep009"
"4593",1347,"that two-car garage I that's something","ep009"
"4594",1350,"we both really wanted and the curb","ep009"
"4595",1353,"appeal was absolutely stunning love the","ep009"
"4596",1356,"dark hardwood let's not forget the","ep009"
"4597",1359,"fireplace the stainless appliances yeah","ep009"
"4598",1362,"but I wanted black the cabinets were","ep009"
"4599",1365,"beautiful but the wrong color","ep009"
"4600",1368,"I would prefer white the backyard there","ep009"
"4601",1371,"was plenty of space out there I think","ep009"
"4602",1374,"that would be the dogs favorite we were","ep009"
"4603",1377,"the house faced to work right it faced","ep009"
"4604",1380,"West yes so we would get afternoon Sun","ep009"
"4605",1383,"we would get the sunsets","ep009"
"4606",1386,"but cookie-cutter house is right on top","ep009"
"4607",1389,"of each other also with the view not","ep009"
"4608",1392,"your traditional you know jaw-dropper of","ep009"
"4609",1395,"a view what did you think of the cabin","ep009"
"4610",1398,"at 225,000 that cabin really looked like","ep009"
"4611",1401,"Tennessee to me what about the dogs","ep009"
"4612",1404,"there's no","ep009"
"4613",1407,"for them to play well there was an area","ep009"
"4614",1410,"out there that was clear put up a fence","ep009"
"4615",1413,"there's plenty of room I love the","ep009"
"4616",1416,"fireplace","ep009"
"4617",1419,"oh the fireplace was really nice really","ep009"
"4618",1422,"beautiful problem that I had though","ep009"
"4619",1425,"there was so much wood","ep009"
"4620",1428,"yeah well it's a cabin I did not like","ep009"
"4621",1431,"the appliances at all those white","ep009"
"4622",1434,"appliances but it's the view it faces","ep009"
"4623",1437,"West that was beautiful sunsets over the","ep009"
"4624",1440,"Great Smoky Mountains every single day","ep009"
"4625",1443,"that's the view we pictured when we were","ep009"
"4626",1446,"thinking about moving here what do you","ep009"
"4627",1449,"think of the palm house for two hundred","ep009"
"4628",1452,"and five thousand it did really have a","ep009"
"4629",1455,"great look it was a really warm field","ep009"
"4630",1458,"but there's no fireplace that so-called","ep009"
"4631",1461,"backyard yeah","ep009"
"4632",1464,"faced north and there's a cemetery it's","ep009"
"4633",1467,"a little creepy I've got to say they","ep009"
"4634",1470,"loved the fact that it did have a","ep009"

"4886",606,"anybody that has to go to the bathroom","ep010"
"4887",609,"has to use one of ours in our bedrooms","ep010"
"4888",612,"that's true unless we did that in the","ep010"
"4889",615,"media room which then doesn't work in","ep010"
"4890",618,"our budget that's exactly your catch","ep010"
"4891",621,"so their agents found a house with a","ep010"
"4892",624,"different layout they may like more it's","ep010"
"4893",627,"been completely completely remodeled","ep010"
"4894",630,"from the Melissa and fiance Brian met 30","ep010"
"4895",633,"years ago when they were competitive","ep010"
"4896",636,"divers in Miami he in particular still","ep010"
"4897",639,"loves the sport impressive diving skill","ep010"
"4898",642,"still and he will not hesitate to show","ep010"
"4899",645,"you those if you put him near any body","ep010"
"4900",648,"of water I'm a competitive show-off on","ep010"
"4901",651,"the hunt for their first place together","ep010"
"4902",654,"in the Miami area they've already seen a","ep010"
"4903",657,"mid-century modern that was below their","ep010"
"4904",660,"$900,000 budget it had a pool and","ep010"
"4905",663,"barbecue area they liked but it also had","ep010"
"4906",666,"a lot of projects so today their agents","ep010"
"4907",669,"found a place that's been recently","ep010"
"4908",672,"renovated this is a townhouse it's","ep010"
"4909",675,"almost it's a little over 2,600 square","ep010"
"4910",678,"feet it's a four bedroom two and a half","ep010"
"4911",681,"baths and the asking price is 1.1 whoa","ep010"
"4912",684,"oh that's I know it would have to dazzle","ep010"
"4913",687,"us okay well one I hope it does it's","ep010"
"4914",690,"been completely completely remodeled","ep010"
"4915",693,"from the guts up and they use a lot of","ep010"
"4916",696,"high-end finishes as well so Melissa and","ep010"
"4917",699,"I are approved up to a million maybe a","ep010"
"4918",702,"little bit more but we definitely don't","ep010"
"4919",705,"want to spend that much second trip up","ep010"
"4920",708,"communities for you to have your","ep010"
"4921",711,"community pool and we're on the water as","ep010"
"4922",714,"well so there's some arena it's not","ep010"
"4923",717,"visible from the house but it's here in","ep010"
"4924",720,"the same community okay so that's","ep010"
"4925",723,"something to take into consideration","ep010"
"4926",726,"girls so not a corner townhouse that","ep010"
"4927",729,"there's no other townhouses next to you","ep010"
"4928",732,"so you're more private","ep010"
"4929",735,"as far as mid-century modern house we","ep010"
"4930",738,"can't do anything to the exterior but","ep010"
"4931",741,"then there's also no me","ep010"
"4932",744,"either so that's great yeah it does make","ep010"
"4933",747,"it easy great right so let's look at it","ep010"
"4934",750,"inside okay what do you think very","ep010"
"4935",753,"pretty that's well done this is your","ep010"
"4936",756,"living room I like the open floor plan I","ep010"
"4937",759,"do love the color palette I love the","ep010"
"4938",762,"gray and modern like you it's clean","ep010"
"4939",765,"modern girl and I do love how it's","ep010"
"4940",768,"connected to patio I mean this is","ep010"
"4941",771,"actually a nice space but it would be","ep010"
"4942",774,"nice to set up tables chairs a barbecue","ep010"

"5073",1167,"concerns and the fact that there's not","ep010"
"5074",1170,"the potential for a media room is really","ep010"
"5075",1173,"big deal for us but with several other","ep010"

"5091",1221,"did have a nice feel and it did have its","ep010"
"5092",1224,"own pool but some of the bedrooms were","ep010"
"5093",1227,"small and the kitchen wasn't what they","ep010"
"5094",1230,"were looking for tiny and the weird","ep010"
"5095",1233,"dining room off the kitchen means that","ep010"
"5096",1236,"we'd have to basically renovate that","ep010"
"5097",1239,"whole space no in addition to the media","ep010"
"5098",1242,"room right so you've got more than just","ep010"
"5099",1245,"a few projects their second option is a","ep010"
"5100",1248,"two-story townhome 1.1 million for a","ep010"
"5101",1251,"townhouse over our budget way over our","ep010"
"5102",1254,"budget and the outdoor space is small","ep010"
"5103",1257,"with no private pool but I did love how","ep010"
"5104",1260,"the renovation was done on the inside","ep010"
"5105",1263,"yeah the kitchen the open floor plan the","ep010"
"5106",1266,"great master suite also it's very low","ep010"
"5107",1269,"mean","ep010"
"5108",1272,"it's kind of nice that you don't have to","ep010"
"5109",1275,"worry about the lawn that's true","ep010"
"5110",1278,"now how about the ultra super modern","ep010"
"5111",1281,"it's exactly what I was envisioning for","ep010"
"5112",1284,"us it is modern and contemporary and for","ep010"
"5113",1287,"877 having a brand-new construction it","ep010"
"5114",1290,"really is a great great bargain but","ep010"
"5115",1293,"there were some issues the backyard was","ep010"
"5116",1296,"super tiny no opportunity for a media","ep010"
"5117",1299,"room and there's the issues with privacy","ep010"
"5118",1302,"[Music]","ep010"
"5119",1305,"the one I think we can eliminate right","ep010"
"5120",1308,"away is the town house I totally agree","ep010"
"5121",1311,"it's you know over our budget","ep010"
"5122",1314,"I love the ultra-modern but the privacy","ep010"
"5123",1317,"issue is something I can't live with the","ep010"
"5124",1320,"mid-century modern home might be a","ep010"
"5125",1323,"better fit for us because it's got a","ep010"
"5126",1326,"bigger patio and pool we could do some","ep010"
"5127",1329,"of the renovations later on I agree I","ep010"
"5128",1332,"think it's something that we can do over","ep010"
"5129",1335,"time this century modern mid-century","ep010"
"5130",1338,"modern it is all right let's give a nice","ep010"
"5131",1341,"drink on top of the good news okay this","ep010"
"5132",1344,"is to be the first time yeah finally","ep010"

"5137",1359,"will get you organized in no time oh you","ep010"
"5138",1362,"are so funny see the asking price was","ep010"
"5139",1365,"879 and we actually got it for 866 we","ep010"
"5140",1368,"know that we have to put money into this","ep010"
"5141",1371,"house but we didn't mind because we were","ep010"
"5142",1374,"getting so many things that we had","ep010"
"5143",1377,"wanted we got the pool","ep010"
"5144",1380,"we got the bedrooms for the girls office","ep010"

"5146",1386,"room which is huge and that kitchen","ep010"
"5147",1389,"renovation is gonna be gorgeous","ep010"
"5148",1392,"so I envision taking down this wall okay","ep010"
"5149",1395,"and maybe having some sort of an island","ep010"
"5150",1398,"slash dining table but their top","ep010"
"5151",1401,"priority is the curb appeal","ep010"
"5152",1404,"we've already ripped out all of the","ep010"
"5153",1407,"excess landscaping there's no more","ep010"
"5154",1410,"bushes for criticizing we're gonna","ep010"

"5426",783,"but since I prepare the majority of the","ep011"
"5427",786,"meals I think that's what we'll stick","ep011"
"5428",789,"with Wow","ep011"
"5429",792,"I like this yeah this is a nice deck but","ep011"
"5430",795,"there's no fence for the dogs I get when","ep011"

"5466",903,"truck if it hails","ep011"
"5467",906,"I lost my last truck to Hale and if it","ep011"
"5468",909,"hails a lot around here I don't want to","ep011"
"5469",912,"completely damage my brand-new truck","ep011"
"5470",915,"we only have two vehicles so you can","ep011"
"5471",918,"pull in on the third one and I could","ep011"
"5472",921,"kind of angle so what'd you guys think","ep011"
"5473",924,"of that I really loved the the","ep011"
"5474",927,"downstairs the storm shelter a safety","ep011"
"5475",930,"factor for us so it's definitely my kind","ep011"
"5476",933,"of house I love the kitchen the outsides","ep011"
"5477",936,"not really what I had in mind well I","ep011"
"5478",939,"like the ranch it's move-in ready but","ep011"
"5479",942,"when I get here I can't paint anything I","ep011"
"5480",945,"can't fix any rooms up I think I'd like","ep011"
"5481",948,"to see something with a little more","ep011"
"5482",951,"character but character is open to","ep011"
"5483",954,"interpretation oh I think this is a","ep011"
"5484",957,"split-level","ep011"
"5485",960,"[Music]","ep011"
"5486",963,"before a walk Laney and Tyler excited to","ep011"
"5487",966,"move back to Missouri where they can","ep011"
"5488",969,"enjoy the outdoors year-round yeah we","ep011"
"5489",972,"like working out in the yard she thinks","ep011"
"5490",975,"she has a green thumb yes I used a lot","ep011"
"5491",978,"of fertilizer now we're gonna have to","ep011"
"5492",981,"see if there's a dog park somewhere in","ep011"
"5493",984,"that we can let them off a leash hiking","ep011"
"5494",987,"trails are fun anything outdoors really","ep011"
"5495",990,"is kind of our thing working with a","ep011"
"5496",993,"three hundred and twenty five thousand","ep011"
"5497",996,"dollar budget they've seen a well-priced","ep011"
"5498",999,"traditional with craftsman touches that","ep011"
"5499",1002,"Lanie liked but the small garage and","ep011"
"5500",1005,"unfinished basement turned off Tyler","ep011"
"5501",1008,"then they saw a move-in-ready ranch with","ep011"
"5502",1011,"a dedicated storm shelter and Lanie's","ep011"
"5503",1014,"white kitchen but Tyler would have to","ep011"
"5504",1017,"squeeze his massive truck into the","ep011"
"5505",1020,"garage and there was no fence","ep011"
"5506",1023,"it was also higher in the budget and","ep011"
"5507",1026,"there'd be no DIY projects for Laney so","ep011"
"5508",1029,"today they're seeing another option oh I","ep011"
"5509",1032,"think this is a split-level doesn't look","ep011"
"5510",1035,"bad","ep011"
"5511",1038,"I can see ourselves in it it's got a","ep011"
"5512",1041,"three-car garage yeah I'll just start","ep011"
"5513",1044,"hey Lanie","ep011"

"5515",1050,"surprised at 264 nine Oh some below well","ep011"
"5516",1053,"it's going to take a look awesome","ep011"
"5517",1056,"alright guys so this is a split foyer I","ep011"
"5518",1059,"just don't like how you can see both","ep011"
"5519",1062,"upstairs and downstairs at the same time","ep011"

"5521",1068,"hardwoods that you like yeah that's true","ep011"
"5522",1071,"that's a compromise","ep011"
"5523",1074,"Lori's actually working to try and find","ep011"
"5524",1077,"something that Lanie and I are both can","ep011"
"5525",1080,"compromise on fellini we have beautiful","ep011"
"5526",1083,"cherry hardwood floors and I wanted you","ep011"
"5527",1086,"to see how open it is yeah I like the","ep011"

"5529",1092,"granite countertop lots of cabinet space","ep011"

"5531",1098,"they're lighter though it's so pretty","ep011"
"5532",1101,"you know we could put barstools up here","ep011"
"5533",1104,"this would be a nice little spot for","ep011"
"5534",1107,"breakfast we have your stainless steel","ep011"
"5535",1110,"appliances and a copper farm sink that's","ep011"
"5536",1113,"a really cute feature but there's no","ep011"

"5539",1122,"they put butter on the wall makes you","ep011"
"5540",1125,"own a baked potato this deck they just","ep011"

"5563",1194,"to be at Tyler it's a move-in-ready","ep011"
"5564",1197,"house but this house is toward the","ep011"
"5565",1200,"bottom of our budget even if we do the","ep011"
"5566",1203,"things I wanted to do I think we'd still","ep011"
"5567",1206,"have money left over alright guys so","ep011"
"5568",1209,"this is your man's face second family","ep011"

"5575",1230,"like this for an office and here is the","ep011"
"5576",1233,"garage a little bit smaller you should","ep011"
"5577",1236,"just get a shorter truck that's way","ep011"
"5578",1239,"easier than getting a bigger house if I","ep011"
"5579",1242,"can angle it that might help we can","ep011"
"5580",1245,"figure something out I can definitely","ep011"
"5581",1248,"see the split that you tried to do his","ep011"
"5582",1251,"downstairs hers upstairs I do like the","ep011"
"5583",1254,"way that the floor plan is open up here","ep011"
"5584",1257,"I like the light cabinets it feels very","ep011"
"5585",1260,"light aside from this butter color on","ep011"
"5586",1263,"the walls I can't stand the master with","ep011"
"5587",1266,"no door to the bathroom","ep011"
"5588",1269,"it is a lot lower on the budget and that","ep011"
"5589",1272,"gives me plenty of room to do all these","ep011"
"5590",1275,"little things that I want to do to it","ep011"
"5591",1278,"I'm getting tired of living with","ep011"
"5592",1281,"mother-in-law so hopefully we can make a","ep011"
"5593",1284,"decision soon and since none of the","ep011"
"5594",1287,"houses have a fenced yard Laney and","ep011"
"5595",1290,"Tyler may have to decide what's most","ep011"
"5596",1293,"important a large dining space a big","ep011"
"5597",1296,"master suite or nabbing that three-car","ep011"
"5598",1299,"garage we have a big decision to make","ep011"
"5599",1302,"[Music]","ep011"
"5600",1305,"what do you think about all these houses","ep011"
"5601",1308,"we've seen I think we need to go through","ep011"
"5602",1311,"them Laney and Tyler have up to three","ep011"
"5603",1314,"hundred and twenty five thousand dollars","ep011"
"5604",1317,"to spend on a house in Warrensburg","ep011"
"5605",1320,"Missouri they've seen several options","ep011"
"5606",1323,"now it's decision time what's the first","ep011"
"5607",1326,"one that's the traditional right uh-huh","ep011"
"5608",1329,"priced at 279 nine the price is right it","ep011"
"5609",1332,"is pretty much move-in ready and it was","ep011"
"5610",1335,"a huge house I really liked the layout","ep011"
"5611",1338,"there and the master setup was nice I","ep011"
"5612",1341,"didn't like the kitchen at all there's","ep011"
"5613",1344,"enough space downstairs for me to have","ep011"
"5614",1347,"some man's face but it didn't really","ep011"
"5615",1350,"have a storm shelter what did you think","ep011"
"5616",1353,"of a new-construction ranch the price","ep011"
"5617",1356,"was just under three hundred nine a","ep011"
"5618",1359,"little bit high but it is moving ready","ep011"
"5619",1362,"but I can't really put my stamp on","ep011"
"5620",1365,"something like that but it has the","ep011"
"5621",1368,"hardwoods that you want upstairs it has","ep011"
"5622",1371,"a carpet I want downstairs but fencing","ep011"
"5623",1374,"you know a large yard is quite a bit of","ep011"
"5624",1377,"money well what did you think about that","ep011"
"5625",1380,"split-level traditional it was really","ep011"
"5626",1383,"under budget at 264 nine I personally","ep011"
"5627",1386,"like it because as soon as you walk in","ep011"
"5628",1389,"you go straight down stairs for my man","ep011"
"5629",1392,"space or you go straight upstairs for","ep011"
"5630",1395,"the kitchen the kitchen was nice lots of","ep011"
"5631",1398,"cabinet and counter space but I think we","ep011"
"5632",1401,"got a little bit too much into that open","ep011"
"5633",1404,"concept when you go into the master","ep011"
"5634",1407,"bedroom straight into that master","ep011"
"5635",1410,"bathroom I think we definitely need to","ep011"
"5636",1413,"make a decision","ep011"
"5637",1416,"I personally want the turnkey ranch","ep011"
"5638",1419,"I think the downstairs being my man's","ep011"
"5639",1422,"face with carpet that's what I want","ep011"
"5640",1425,"believe it or not that's all I like to I","ep011"
"5641",1428,"don't get to put my stamp on things but","ep011"
"5642",1431,"if you give me some space to work on my","ep011"
"5643",1434,"other little projects I think it would","ep011"
"5644",1437,"be a good compromise you ready to make","ep011"
"5645",1440,"an offer and call Lori yeah let's give","ep011"
"5646",1443,"her a call all right hey this is for the","ep011"
"5647",1446,"party we bought the house about six","ep011"
"5648",1449,"weeks ago and then we moved in a couple","ep011"

"5651",1458,"listed for 308 for 75 waited up going in","ep011"

"5653",1464,"we're ready okay I personally wanted","ep011"
"5654",1467,"this house because it was a ranch it","ep011"
"5655",1470,"also gave me my man space downstairs I","ep011"
"5656",1473,"have the guest room the wet bar the","ep011"

"5665",1500,"it's really nice and relaxing with a","ep011"
"5666",1503,"great view but with the budget being as","ep011"
"5667",1506,"high as it was we did have to compromise","ep011"
"5668",1509,"and not have a fence yet so that is","ep011"
"5669",1512,"gonna be an extra expense that I wasn't","ep011"
"5670",1515,"really wanted to have the compromises I","ep011"
"5671",1518,"made in this house are the fact that I","ep011"
"5672",1521,"didn't get to do any renovations to it","ep011"
"5673",1524,"that's because I got my move-in-ready","ep011"
"5674",1527,"house but I've gotten to do other","ep011"

"5720",105,"with both of our jobs being from home to","ep012"

"5738",159,"house with all the amenities that we're","ep012"
"5739",162,"asking for at 250 is going to be nearly","ep012"
"5740",165,"impossible I think three and fifty","ep012"
"5741",168,"thousand would be more in my range you","ep012"
"5742",171,"could definitely get a turnkey house and","ep012"

"5864",537,"think there's one other space that you","ep012"
"5865",540,"guys are gonna love what is this they're","ep012"
"5866",543,"still moving out so some of their stuff","ep012"
"5867",546,"still here maybe you could use part of","ep012"
"5868",549,"it as your office so there's no","ep012"
"5869",552,"dedicated office in the house","ep012"
"5870",555,"convert this to an office we kind of","ep012"
"5871",558,"need that going in so we can start","ep012"
"5872",561,"working immediately it's gonna be hard","ep012"
"5873",564,"to find everything that they're looking","ep012"
"5874",567,"for but he's also willing to pay for it","ep012"
"5875",570,"but Emily's not I think they have to","ep012"
"5876",573,"have a come-to-jesus meeting and figure","ep012"
"5877",576,"out what's really truly important good","ep012"
"5878",579,"job picking it out to show us I love the","ep012"
"5879",582,"side but don't love is the bedrooms are","ep012"
"5880",585,"far apart I was extremely disappointed","ep012"
"5881",588,"about the yard the other thing is I have","ep012"
"5882",591,"to basically build a home office in","ep012"
"5883",594,"scratch I want something turnkey it","ep012"
"5884",597,"could be a very quick 2 month project","ep012"
"5885",600,"very affordable but the one thing I did","ep012"
"5886",603,"love is the bonus room I mean that can","ep012"
"5887",606,"be easily converted to an entertainment","ep012"
"5888",609,"room but again if we look at something","ep012"
"5889",612,"with a larger budget maybe it could","ep012"
"5890",615,"include other features that are missing","ep012"
"5891",618,"in this house so now Marcus has lined up","ep012"
"5892",621,"a home on over 2 acres for Gerry but it","ep012"
"5893",624,"may be a stretch for both of them","ep012"
"5894",627,"375,000 whoa swing Florida transplants","ep012"
"5895",630,"Emily and Gerry are searching suburban","ep012"
"5896",633,"Chattanooga Tennessee for a new family","ep012"
"5897",636,"home but they have conflicting","ep012"
"5898",639,"priorities she wants to stay on the low","ep012"
"5899",642,"end of their 250 to 350 thousand dollar","ep012"
"5900",645,"budget so they can pay the house off in","ep012"
"5901",648,"15 years but he would rather spend more","ep012"
"5902",651,"if it gets them a huge yard for the kids","ep012"
"5903",654,"so far they've seen a ranch that was","ep012"
"5904",657,"under her budget but it wasn't moving","ep012"
"5905",660,"for Jerry and it lacked the pool Emily","ep012"
"5906",663,"was hoping for so today their agent","ep012"
"5907",666,"Marcus has found an updated house in the","ep012"
"5908",669,"Yorktown woods neighborhood but he","ep012"
"5909",672,"thinks could be a good compromise","ep012"
"5910",675,"definitely has a colonial feel look","ep012"
"5911",678,"sound like a ranch as well that was is","ep012"
"5912",681,"it all one floor it's actually three","ep012"
"5913",684,"floors four bedrooms four and a half","ep012"
"5914",687,"baths a little bit under 4,000 square","ep012"
"5915",690,"feet 375,000 Wow I know it's a little","ep012"
"5916",693,"high but has two and a half acres of","ep012"
"5917",696,"land could we afford it sure but I'm not","ep012"
"5918",699,"paying 375 for a house it's gonna","ep012"
"5919",702,"totally screw up our financial planner","ep012"
"5920",705,"Marcus you know how we feel about the","ep012"
"5921",708,"backyard yeah no let's go check it out I","ep012"
"5922",711,"love it that's my kind of pool we've got","ep012"
"5923",714,"the diving board man is asleep but","ep012"
"5924",717,"there's no space probably an acre of","ep012"
"5925",720,"this property is in the woods it's not","ep012"
"5926",723,"usable maybe we can clear some of this","ep012"
"5927",726,"so for 375 we are going to then be","ep012"
"5928",729,"paying money to clear land did I miss","ep012"
"5929",732,"something you said our budget was down","ep012"
"5930",735,"to 250 I said 350 this is higher than","ep012"
"5931",738,"what we both initially thought all right","ep012"
"5932",741,"no you're right it's higher than I want","ep012"
"5933",744,"this for a minute all right so why don't","ep012"
"5934",747,"we do that but I'm just telling you that","ep012"
"5935",750,"the backyard doesn't work for me all","ep012"
"5936",753,"right I like the hardwood floors now","ep012"
"5937",756,"they aren't few different colors which","ep012"
"5938",759,"is kind of odd what we're standing in","ep012"
"5939",762,"right now all right so this is gonna be","ep012"
"5940",765,"your formal living room it seems a","ep012"
"5941",768,"little small but you like the molding","ep012"
"5942",771,"this is the formal dining I definitely","ep012"
"5943",774,"like this kitchen I love this backsplash","ep012"
"5944",777,"I think you have some granite countertop","ep012"

"5951",798,"I love the crown molding you know","ep012"
"5952",801,"overall the inside of the house has a","ep012"
"5953",804,"lot of upgrades so that I really like it","ep012"
"5954",807,"could offset the yard to a degree so you","ep012"
"5955",810,"know what I gotta be more open to that","ep012"
"5956",813,"Wow I really like this room this is a","ep012"
"5957",816,"great office yes this should work for","ep012"
"5958",819,"both of our desks across the living room","ep012"
"5959",822,"is the master bedroom","ep012"
"5960",825,"so the first wow this is a really big","ep012"

"5964",837,"house surprised me I really like it","ep012"
"5965",840,"actually I wasn't prepared to because","ep012"
"5966",843,"it's way out of budget next it's","ep012"
"5967",846,"downstairs to see the basement oh wow","ep012"
"5968",849,"this is big this could be a great","ep012"
"5969",852,"entertainment room and you also get a","ep012"
"5970",855,"full bath on this level okay great","ep012"
"5971",858,"there are two bedrooms up here so","ep012"
"5972",861,"there's no bedrooms on the main floor","ep012"
"5973",864,"near the master no bedrooms on the main","ep012"
"5974",867,"floor near best yeah that's a little bit","ep012"
"5975",870,"of a problem they see a bedroom that","ep012"
"5976",873,"would work for one of the kids and pass","ep012"
"5977",876,"through a jack-and-jill bath on the way","ep012"
"5978",879,"to the next bedroom Wow large room this","ep012"
"5979",882,"is a perfect place for bunk beds twin","ep012"
"5980",885,"beds or whatever okay did you had to","ep012"
"5981",888,"walk through the kids room or whatever","ep012"
"5982",891,"this room would be to get to okay yes","ep012"
"5983",894,"whoa I really like it now is this a","ep012"
"5984",897,"closet this is actually not a closet","ep012"
"5985",900,"this is what I was using as a surprise","ep012"
"5986",903,"for you guys","ep012"
"5987",906,"this is actually own entryway oh wow for","ep012"
"5988",909,"this room so you can just close that","ep012"

"5993",924,"[Applause]","ep012"
"5994",927,"it's got a lot of space it has a lot of","ep012"
"5995",930,"flex pace I don't want that the master","ep012"
"5996",933,"is down here on the first floor and not","ep012"
"5997",936,"up at the other bedroom but obviously I","ep012"
"5998",939,"love the backyard is fantastic I say","ep012"
"5999",942,"probably the backyard for me was the","ep012"
"6000",945,"biggest disappointment but I was very","ep012"
"6001",948,"impressed with the different types of","ep012"
"6002",951,"details like the granite counter and the","ep012"
"6003",954,"molding I mean it is over budget","ep012"
"6004",957,"it sounds a bit an education on what we","ep012"
"6005",960,"can get at that higher price point yes","ep012"
"6006",963,"yeah so now Marcus has lined up a house","ep012"
"6007",966,"that's priced right but it comes with a","ep012"
"6008",969,"compromise I cannot wait till you just","ep012"
"6009",972,"have some down time here as a family","ep012"
"6010",975,"Laurita transplants Emily and Gerry have","ep012"
"6011",978,"up to three hundred and fifty thousand","ep012"
"6012",981,"to spend on a family home in suburban","ep012"
"6013",984,"Chattanooga Tennessee but they're","ep012"
"6014",987,"dueling budgets and high expectations","ep012"
"6015",990,"have been a challenge so far they've","ep012"
"6016",993,"seen a house under Emily's budget but","ep012"
"6017",996,"Gerry felt spending more would give them","ep012"
"6018",999,"the upgrade they're looking for then","ep012"
"6019",1002,"they saw a home with a lot of upgrades","ep012"
"6020",1005,"but the three hundred and seventy five","ep012"
"6021",1008,"thousand dollar price tag was too steep","ep012"
"6022",1011,"even for Jared","ep012"
"6023",1014,"so today their agent Marcus has lined up","ep012"
"6024",1017,"a home near the North Ridge Lake","ep012"
"6025",1020,"neighborhood that could split the","ep012"
"6026",1023,"difference","ep012"
"6027",1026,"gotta all brick colonial I love it yeah","ep012"
"6028",1029,"I wouldn't have thought I would but it's","ep012"
"6029",1032,"charming six bedroom three and a half","ep012"
"6030",1035,"bath house and it has 3,700 square feet","ep012"
"6031",1038,"list price","ep012"
"6032",1041,"305 it's within our budget that's above","ep012"
"6033",1044,"my budget but can we first take a look","ep012"
"6034",1047,"at the backyard let's go and do that the","ep012"
"6035",1050,"community does have a pool I will give","ep012"
"6036",1053,"it to you the one thing this does have","ep012"
"6037",1056,"is that it's flat but it's all cement","ep012"
"6038",1059,"you do get a really nice back deck","ep012"
"6039",1062,"overlooking the force here this is","ep012"
"6040",1065,"beautiful","ep012"
"6041",1068,"I just wish there's a little bit more","ep012"
"6042",1071,"yard to work with I'm just really","ep012"
"6043",1074,"disappointed I'm just looking for a flat","ep012"
"6044",1077,"piece of open land and I'm not finding","ep012"
"6045",1080,"it anywhere come on in check it out Wow","ep012"
"6046",1083,"I like the Bannister in the railing","ep012"
"6047",1086,"nice-sized dining room powered floors","ep012"
"6048",1089,"chair and the chair","ep012"
"6049",1092,"oh wow look at this that is a unique","ep012"

"6052",1101,"be cool then bookcase in here is a focal","ep012"
"6053",1104,"point a little offbeat but I think you","ep012"
"6054",1107,"could have some creative fun with that I","ep012"
"6055",1110,"really love this fireplace","ep012"
"6056",1113,"this is exactly what you see I love this","ep012"
"6057",1116,"oh my gosh yeah I like the countertops","ep012"
"6058",1119,"these are not granite","ep012"
"6059",1122,"but they're nice like yeah I mean it","ep012"
"6060",1125,"definitely goes well with the color of","ep012"
"6061",1128,"the brick next they head downstairs to","ep012"
"6062",1131,"see the basement Wow this is the","ep012"
"6063",1134,"entertainment room Wow okay this could","ep012"
"6064",1137,"be probably a nice dedicated office here","ep012"
"6065",1140,"you already have some built-in shelves","ep012"
"6066",1143,"and cabinets yeah on the other end of","ep012"
"6067",1146,"the basement is a full guest suite this","ep012"
"6068",1149,"is perfect it is right down off the back","ep012"
"6069",1152,"exactly there's a lot of space to play","ep012"
"6070",1155,"with have enough room for our kids","ep012"
"6071",1158,"and plenty of room for extra guests","ep012"
"6072",1161,"upstairs they look at four bedrooms","ep012"
"6073",1164,"every one of our kids can","ep012"
"6074",1167,"this is basic here on the way to the","ep012"
"6075",1170,"shared bath oh my gosh does two safes in","ep012"
"6076",1173,"here","ep012"
"6077",1176,"the girls would each have their own","ep012"
"6078",1179,"sinks when they're teenagers getting","ep012"
"6079",1182,"ready in the morning that's the good","ep012"
"6080",1185,"thing I think you got your master","ep012"
"6081",1188,"bedroom or just tray ceiling and it's","ep012"
"6082",1191,"just a short hallway away from the kids","ep012"
"6083",1194,"room I mean this is great look at this","ep012"
"6084",1197,"yeah this is definitely enough marble","ep012"
"6085",1200,"countertops together but at least we","ep012"
"6086",1203,"have separate sinks right yeah I mean","ep012"
"6087",1206,"this together so we have to share it","ep012"
"6088",1209,"it's play nice absolutely","ep012"
"6089",1212,"this is nice fear making the wrong","ep012"
"6090",1215,"decision it may not be right in that","ep012"
"6091",1218,"sweet spot of the budget that I really","ep012"
"6092",1221,"want but I don't want to pass on","ep012"
"6093",1224,"something that can be a good house for","ep012"
"6094",1227,"our family you have all the space you","ep012"
"6095",1230,"have the extra basement downstairs with","ep012"
"6096",1233,"all those rooms you have a guest room","ep012"
"6097",1236,"and it's got all those cool features I","ep012"
"6098",1239,"like the really neat freak out of a","ep012"
"6099",1242,"feature probably the one thing it","ep012"
"6100",1245,"doesn't have is number-one priority for","ep012"
"6101",1248,"me I want you guys like you already know","ep012"
"6102",1251,"how important that is to you why for","ep012"
"6103",1254,"myself I want for our kids but you got a","ep012"
"6104",1257,"concern this house is at 305 I mean it","ep012"
"6105",1260,"is still way over my budget now it's","ep012"
"6106",1263,"time to decide what's most important the","ep012"
"6107",1266,"budget the backyard a renovation project","ep012"
"6108",1269,"I'm ready to make you sisters in there","ep012"
"6109",1272,"yes yes Florida transplants Jerry and","ep012"
"6110",1275,"Emily have up to 350 grand to spend on a","ep012"
"6111",1278,"new home in Chattanooga Tennessee","ep012"
"6112",1281,"they've seen a number of places now it's","ep012"
"6113",1284,"time to decide what house that we should","ep012"
"6114",1287,"definitely consider the one for 240 the","ep012"
"6115",1290,"ranch that meets all your retirement","ep012"
"6116",1293,"plans for us but you still did not like","ep012"
"6117",1296,"the bedrooms being far away right the","ep012"
"6118",1299,"master was on the opposite side of the","ep012"
"6119",1302,"house from the bedrooms and I'd like to","ep012"
"6120",1305,"be closer to the kids the downstairs did","ep012"
"6121",1308,"feel","ep012"
"6122",1311,"dated didn't have the separate vanities","ep012"
"6123",1314,"and I didn't have an office and we need","ep012"
"6124",1317,"a dedicated office space you did have","ep012"
"6125",1320,"that separate area downstairs for the","ep012"
"6126",1323,"guests and the entertainment area I like","ep012"
"6127",1326,"the hardwood floors I like the fireplace","ep012"
"6128",1329,"the kitchen it was a little bit dated","ep012"
"6129",1332,"but that yard was huge it was sloped but","ep012"
"6130",1335,"it was big the one with the pool for 375","ep012"
"6131",1338,"obviously the budget is is a huge","ep012"
"6132",1341,"concern I mean it was two and a half","ep012"
"6133",1344,"acres but most of that was all woods but","ep012"
"6134",1347,"a love the colonial molding inside the","ep012"
"6135",1350,"house amazing fireplace with a wooden","ep012"
"6136",1353,"mantel the upgraded kitchen it did have","ep012"
"6137",1356,"the office this one the master was even","ep012"
"6138",1359,"further from the kids rooms but the","ep012"
"6139",1362,"house did have that great basement","ep012"
"6140",1365,"you're right I mean I can see it working","ep012"
"6141",1368,"in a lot of ways so what'd you think","ep012"
"6142",1371,"about the large colonial brick house it","ep012"
"6143",1374,"was 305 which is I know comfortable for","ep012"
"6144",1377,"you it's a little more than I would feel","ep012"
"6145",1380,"comfortable with but the house itself","ep012"
"6146",1383,"was wonderful all Howard floors which I","ep012"
"6147",1386,"absolutely loved had a fireplace six","ep012"
"6148",1389,"bedrooms","ep012"
"6149",1392,"plenty of room our families and friends","ep012"
"6150",1395,"to come and visit and the master bedroom","ep012"
"6151",1398,"I thought that was huge the thing with","ep012"
"6152",1401,"this is that yard I know how important","ep012"
"6153",1404,"that is to you and if you know it","ep012"
"6154",1407,"literally had that thing no yard","ep012"
"6155",1410,"whatsoever what do we want to do which","ep012"
"6156",1413,"one will they choose","ep012"
"6157",1416,"you know what I think we should choose","ep012"
"6158",1419,"the ranch with the large yard oh my gosh","ep012"
"6159",1422,"you know it may not have the flat piece","ep012"
"6160",1425,"of property that I'm looking for but it","ep012"
"6161",1428,"was going to allow us to save for our","ep012"
"6162",1431,"future Wow I am shocked I agree I mean","ep012"
"6163",1434,"really yeah","ep012"
"6164",1437,"it doesn't have every single space that","ep012"
"6165",1440,"we need I think between the two of us we","ep012"
"6166",1443,"can be creative and figure absolutely","ep012"

"6478",768,"back here all right let's go into the","ep013"
"6479",771,"gourmet kitchen it's nice but way too","ep013"

"6500",834,"yeah there's definitely enough space I","ep013"
"6501",837,"think we just have to figure out who","ep013"
"6502",840,"would go where the bedroom situation is","ep013"
"6503",843,"kind of strange I mean there's three","ep013"
"6504",846,"different levels of bedrooms but I mean","ep013"
"6505",849,"there's so many different options that","ep013"
"6506",852,"I'd have to just sit down and go through","ep013"
"6507",855,"the plans and just see if it could work","ep013"
"6508",858,"for us all right you got your private","ep013"

"6521",897,"yeah I mean the square footage is a nice","ep013"

"6524",906,"some things with this house you know","ep013"
"6525",909,"change out the furniture add some more","ep013"
"6526",912,"modern elements but I'm really looking","ep013"

"6529",921,"it's not for everyone do what I warn you","ep013"

"6541",957,"contemporary home with space to build a","ep013"
"6542",960,"pool but it would put them at the top of","ep013"
"6543",963,"their budget and it lacks any","ep013"
"6544",966,"traditional details for JD JD is partial","ep013"
"6545",969,"to a spacious traditional house with","ep013"
"6546",972,"enough yard space for their kids to play","ep013"

"6548",978,"feels a bit more unique their","ep013"
"6549",981,"real-estate agent Don has another option","ep013"
"6550",984,"to show them but it's a real fixer-upper","ep013"
"6551",987,"I'm really taking a gamble here this is","ep013"
"6552",990,"a unique property not for everyone this","ep013"
"6553",993,"is the coolest house I mean the modern","ep013"

"6628",1218,"square footage Ernie it has that","ep013"
"6629",1221,"mid-century feel I'm looking for I love","ep013"

"6631",1227,"the lake you know definitely not my","ep013"
"6632",1230,"style I'm a little nervous with that","ep013"
"6633",1233,"much construction that needs to be done","ep013"
"6634",1236,"we got four kids it's a huge undertaking","ep013"
"6635",1239,"yeah I mean this is a big decision with","ep013"
"6636",1242,"two very different aesthetics it's time","ep013"
"6637",1245,"for Jenni and JD to see if they can","ep013"
"6638",1248,"agree on which house to call home it may","ep013"
"6639",1251,"come down to a choice between yard and","ep013"
"6640",1254,"style this is a huge huge decision I","ep013"
"6641",1257,"mean I don't know what we're gonna do","ep013"
"6642",1260,"[Music]","ep013"
"6643",1263,"[Applause]","ep013"
"6644",1266,"salisbury maryland couple Jenny and JD","ep013"
"6645",1269,"have a budget of $600,000 and two very","ep013"
"6646",1272,"different ideas of what their next house","ep013"
"6647",1275,"should look like with several options on","ep013"
"6648",1278,"the table it's time to see if they can","ep013"
"6649",1281,"agree on one so what do you think about","ep013"
"6650",1284,"the contemporary it was for 595 it was","ep013"
"6651",1287,"so cool I mean I love those geometric","ep013"
"6652",1290,"windows and that really crazy door that","ep013"
"6653",1293,"opens to nowhere while the house maybe","ep013"
"6654",1296,"wasn't exactly my style from the outside","ep013"
"6655",1299,"you know it wasn't bad on the negative","ep013"
"6656",1302,"side there's not even as much square","ep013"
"6657",1305,"footage as we currently have yeah I","ep013"
"6658",1308,"really had no yard out there which was","ep013"
"6659",1311,"sort of disappointing to me I mean","ep013"
"6660",1314,"obviously it's the top of our price","ep013"
"6661",1317,"range but maybe in a year or two we","ep013"
"6662",1320,"could think about putting a pool so what","ep013"
"6663",1323,"do you think about that craftsman on the","ep013"
"6664",1326,"river for 5:49 you know from the outside","ep013"
"6665",1329,"it's a little bit more my style the more","ep013"
"6666",1332,"traditional I like that of all the","ep013"
"6667",1335,"houses it's probably had the best yard","ep013"
"6668",1338,"the kitchen I love the aesthetics of it","ep013"
"6669",1341,"but it is still pretty small it was tiny","ep013"
"6670",1344,"so that great room with all like the","ep013"
"6671",1347,"high ceilings and everything I mean that","ep013"
"6672",1350,"was a really pretty room but the rest of","ep013"
"6673",1353,"the house is hard because it's very","ep013"
"6674",1356,"traditional and that's just like that's","ep013"
"6675",1359,"not my style at all well what about that","ep013"
"6676",1362,"mid-century modern I mean I know that's","ep013"
"6677",1365,"definitely your style","ep013"
"6678",1368,"that's for 3:49 man that house has so","ep013"
"6679",1371,"many different things going on with it","ep013"
"6680",1374,"it did not have any yard whatsoever","ep013"
"6681",1377,"I mean it's massive it really is but it","ep013"
"6682",1380,"has those modern lines there's","ep013"
"6683",1383,"mid-century details that I was really","ep013"
"6684",1386,"looking for I mean it's it's a big","ep013"
"6685",1389,"renovation job though I mean that's I'm","ep013"
"6686",1392,"not sure we're ready for all that it","ep013"
"6687",1395,"could put a lot of stress on our family","ep013"
"6688",1398,"I haven't been able to sleep just kind","ep013"
"6689",1401,"of think of all these homes and what's","ep013"
"6690",1404,"the best house for us","ep013"
"6691",1407,"I don't know what we're gonna do yeah","ep013"
"6692",1410,"you do the only house that we have the","ep013"
"6693",1413,"budget to change things as the","ep013"
"6694",1416,"mid-century home I mean that place could","ep013"
"6695",1419,"really be a showstopper I'm okay with","ep013"
"6696",1422,"the mid-century modern if you are I","ep013"
"6697",1425,"think you could really put your stamp on","ep013"
"6698",1428,"this house and make it a home for us I","ep013"
"6699",1431,"think the kids are gonna love it hey","ep013"
"6700",1434,"guys so we closed in the house two weeks","ep013"
"6701",1437,"ago and this is why we're we're not","ep013"
"6702",1440,"living in here yet we've got months and","ep013"
"6703",1443,"months of renovations ahead of us we're","ep013"
"6704",1446,"gonna just gut it all right so the house","ep013"
"6705",1449,"is listed for 349 but after the","ep013"
"6706",1452,"inspections we're able to get some","ep013"
"6707",1455,"concessions from the seller Aiona find","ep013"
"6708",1458,"the house for 315 which is good I think","ep013"
"6709",1461,"we're gonna need every dollar that for","ep013"
"6710",1464,"the renovations so rate what we're","ep013"
"6711",1467,"standing right now is where your new","ep013"

"7020",816,"but notice that neon green and then like","ep014"
"7021",819,"that blue paint up there don't worry","ep014"
"7022",822,"about that it's an easy fix","ep014"
"7023",825,"what's with the floors over here oh they","ep014"
"7024",828,"have a different Sun over here I wonder","ep014"
"7025",831,"why they did that I think they used to","ep014"

"7030",846,"I know the the cabinets are not white","ep014"
"7031",849,"but we can paint those but this is this","ep014"
"7032",852,"is the island is awkward and I really","ep014"
"7033",855,"wanted a granite on top so we'd have to","ep014"
"7034",858,"put that in which is gonna be expensive","ep014"
"7035",861,"yeah adding up these costs and paint","ep014"
"7036",864,"once again I've seen 12 colors of paint","ep014"
"7037",867,"me too I know you're gonna come and help","ep014"

"7039",873,"that's gonna be expensive but keep in","ep014"
"7040",876,"mind you don't have to do all the","ep014"
"7041",879,"painting at once that's true I do like","ep014"
"7042",882,"how it flows though it does flow that's","ep014"
"7043",885,"how the hardwood floors go","ep014"
"7044",888,"way through yeah and then we can go look","ep014"
"7045",891,"at my pool let's go look at you yeah","ep014"

"7058",930,"could you see me building a pergola out","ep014"
"7059",933,"here no actually you've never built","ep014"
"7060",936,"anything back inside they take a look at","ep014"

"7062",942,"possible guest room okay they make their","ep014"
"7063",945,"way upstairs and see two bedrooms and a","ep014"

"7163",1245,"pull this out here the nice thing about","ep014"
"7164",1248,"that is with this house being under your","ep014"
"7165",1251,"guys's budget you you have some wiggle","ep014"
"7166",1254,"room with the price where you have some","ep014"
"7167",1257,"money that you could throw around it","ep014"
"7168",1260,"things like an awning okay well we're","ep014"
"7169",1263,"just kind of making the backyard your","ep014"
"7170",1266,"own the price of the house is great it's","ep014"
"7171",1269,"below our budget that's great","ep014"
"7172",1272,"but now you start adding home","ep014"
"7173",1275,"association fees doing some landscaping","ep014"
"7174",1278,"these things all start to add up and now","ep014"
"7175",1281,"we're gonna push ourselves out of our","ep014"
"7176",1284,"range","ep014"
"7177",1287,"they head back inside and see a","ep014"
"7178",1290,"downstairs bedroom and they have their","ep014"
"7179",1293,"own space they had upstairs and peek in","ep014"
"7180",1296,"on two bedrooms for the girls and a bath","ep014"
"7181",1299,"before taking a look at a possible space","ep014"

"7185",1311,"door to keep you guys out daughters know","ep014"
"7186",1314,"how to pick that lock but this would be","ep014"
"7187",1317,"perfect I think farther down the hall is","ep014"
"7188",1320,"the master suite","ep014"
"7189",1323,"it could work it could work what do we","ep014"
"7190",1326,"have here oh this is the master bath","ep014"

"7192",1332,"this is not really a master bathroom","ep014"
"7193",1335,"thank you don't like how there's not a","ep014"
"7194",1338,"room for this I think you need to have","ep014"
"7195",1341,"your own space I can see what you mean","ep014"
"7196",1344,"with that","ep014"
"7197",1347,"yeah Spanish style I think the two-story","ep014"
"7198",1350,"I like the area there are a lot of good","ep014"
"7199",1353,"things for this house and not so good","ep014"
"7200",1356,"things too it's really wasn't the style","ep014"
"7201",1359,"I wanted it's not the ranch I wanted it","ep014"
"7202",1362,"doesn't have a cozy feel the only thing","ep014"
"7203",1365,"that really was on my list was the white","ep014"
"7204",1368,"kitchen I love this yeah I love the","ep014"
"7205",1371,"granite","ep014"
"7206",1374,"I love the rectangular islands I love","ep014"

"7210",1386,"expensive to put together what we want","ep014"
"7211",1389,"if you want to put a pool in or","ep014"
"7212",1392,"Landscaping but there are pools included","ep014"

"7218",1410,"homes coming in below budget they'll","ep014"
"7219",1413,"have to decide what the bigger drawbacks","ep014"
"7220",1416,"actually are not having a private pool","ep014"

"7709",1173,"commute and I asked for Nairobi and I","ep015"
"7710",1176,"think I got Miami work what coming into","ep015"

"7712",1182,"of our friends and families supporting","ep015"
"7713",1185,"us and now we don't have that tribe we","ep015"
"7714",1188,"having that data community is really","ep015"
"7715",1191,"important to me we didn't move here just","ep015"
"7716",1194,"to have a place that we could get back","ep015"
"7717",1197,"home we're moving to Africa I want to","ep015"

"7721",1209,"Jeff Melissa and the kids are moving","ep015"

"7723",1215,"Jeff was transferred at work I really","ep015"
"7724",1218,"want to embrace the African culture","ep015"
"7725",1221,"we're moving to Africa I want to feel","ep015"
"7726",1224,"like I'm in Africa now honestly who","ep015"
"7727",1227,"would have thought we could go to a","ep015"
"7728",1230,"safari in our backyard I am worried that","ep015"
"7729",1233,"I'm going to have the most difficult","ep015"
"7730",1236,"transition not only going from Minnesota","ep015"
"7731",1239,"to Kenya but also go","ep015"
"7732",1242,"from working full time to being a","ep015"
"7733",1245,"stay-at-home mom it's gonna be harder on","ep015"
"7734",1248,"me than anyone else and so looking at","ep015"
"7735",1251,"Jade Valley I see that gated community","ep015"
"7736",1254,"it is a four-bedroom four-bathroom","ep015"
"7737",1257,"property and it has all the amenities","ep015"
"7738",1260,"that you wanted perfect","ep015"
"7739",1263,"neighbors would literally be right on","ep015"
"7740",1266,"top of us that's something new that we'd","ep015"
"7741",1269,"have to get used to being so close to","ep015"
"7742",1272,"neighbors and that price $3,800 that's","ep015"
"7743",1275,"$300 a month over budget and the","ep015"
"7744",1278,"stand-alone home was $100 under budget","ep015"
"7745",1281,"this property is huge it's big its open","ep015"
"7746",1284,"its Airy I feel like I'm finally in","ep015"
"7747",1287,"Nairobi perfect but this house is too","ep015"
"7748",1290,"big I don't know how I'm going to manage","ep015"
"7749",1293,"it that would be just too much work for","ep015"
"7750",1296,"us this is exactly what I've been","ep015"
"7751",1299,"looking for and then the court hearing","ep015"
"7752",1302,"which came in and right at budget","ep015"
"7753",1305,"this is definitely my taste and that","ep015"
"7754",1308,"also has that gated community which is a","ep015"
"7755",1311,"bonus facilities come which is lovely","ep015"
"7756",1314,"pool there's a gym I just don't know if","ep015"
"7757",1317,"I can handle that community potentially","ep015"
"7758",1320,"an hour away depending on traffic I","ep015"
"7759",1323,"definitely think that the courtyard is","ep015"
"7760",1326,"perfect for us","ep015"
"7761",1329,"[Music]","ep015"
"7762",1332,"I think we are in agreement on one thing","ep015"
"7763",1335,"I think there is one property that we","ep015"
"7764",1338,"can eliminate the courtyard that Terrace","ep015"
"7765",1341,"is not for me or the kids yeah and that","ep015"
"7766",1344,"commute time just is not suitable for","ep015"
"7767",1347,"our family I agree","ep015"
"7768",1350,"so we're down to two","ep015"
"7769",1353,"we are the standalone and then another","ep015"
"7770",1356,"property yeah","ep015"
"7771",1359,"but Jade Valley oh yes the stand-alone","ep015"
"7772",1362,"home really gives us the feel of Africa","ep015"
"7773",1365,"it is too much space I feel like it's","ep015"
"7774",1368,"gonna be a full-time job maintaining","ep015"
"7775",1371,"that I really think that Jade Valley is","ep015"
"7776",1374,"a great home for us but the privacy the","ep015"
"7777",1377,"open space the green space and that","ep015"
"7778",1380,"really gives us the indoor/outdoor space","ep015"
"7779",1383,"that we were looking for","ep015"
"7780",1386,"why are we talking anymore we need a","ep015"
"7781",1389,"community and not the standalone home","ep015"
"7782",1392,"and the Jade Valley home it also has the","ep015"
"7783",1395,"playground and a pool we don't have any","ep015"
"7784",1398,"of that in the stand-alone home I still","ep015"
"7785",1401,"don't think it'd be nice to be able to","ep015"
"7786",1404,"have a place of our own","ep015"
"7787",1407,"yes you are so close to us you could","ep015"
"7788",1410,"even come home for lunch you even said","ep015"
"7789",1413,"it yourself you know what you're giving","ep015"
"7790",1416,"up your job to come here I think it's","ep015"
"7791",1419,"important that you're happy I can see","ep015"
"7792",1422,"the kids playing in the playground so I","ep015"

"7858",156,"been looking for homes but to find one","ep016"
"7859",159,"in our price range has been very","ep016"
"7860",162,"difficult originally our budget was 450","ep016"
"7861",165,"thousand dollars but we quickly learned","ep016"
"7862",168,"that that was not going to get us what","ep016"
"7863",171,"we needed and I think if you can bump","ep016"
"7864",174,"that up even a little bit more even","ep016"
"7865",177,"stretching it into the $650,000 range","ep016"

"7868",186,"willing to go up yeah as far as six","ep016"
"7869",189,"fifty they're hoping that they're","ep016"
"7870",192,"increased budget will allow them to stay","ep016"

"7875",207,"best museums in the world this is where","ep016"
"7876",210,"the kids school is and so we would love","ep016"
"7877",213,"to stay in this neighborhood I mean","ep016"
"7878",216,"ideally we would love a single-family","ep016"
"7879",219,"home that has a yard of course I really","ep016"
"7880",222,"am open to town homes or condos","ep016"
"7881",225,"something with a shared wall that","ep016"
"7882",228,"doesn't bother me as much as it does","ep016"
"7883",231,"Suzanne this style of home I like the","ep016"
"7884",234,"most are the contemporary more modern","ep016"
"7885",237,"homes I really like the clean lines the","ep016"
"7886",240,"big glass windows it doesn't feel like","ep016"
"7887",243,"something that maybe my mom or dad could","ep016"
"7888",246,"have lived in it feels like it's more","ep016"
"7889",249,"modern more up today more high-tech","ep016"
"7890",252,"I hate the more modern contemporary home","ep016"
"7891",255,"I prefer a Craftsman style home we owned","ep016"
"7892",258,"a Dutch colonial home in San Antonio it","ep016"
"7893",261,"was built in the 1920s and it had a lot","ep016"
"7894",264,"of the original character I love that","ep016"
"7895",267,"happy wife happy life free in our new","ep016"
"7896",270,"home we would love three bedrooms two","ep016"
"7897",273,"baths two-car garage we really need to","ep016"
"7898",276,"have at least two living spaces right","ep016"
"7899",279,"now in our apartment we only have one","ep016"
"7900",282,"living space and with the two boys is","ep016"
"7901",285,"just Donna from when we have like","ep016"
"7902",288,"friends over with their kids we can have","ep016"
"7903",291,"the adults upstairs and then we can send","ep016"
"7904",294,"the kids downstairs of the basement they","ep016"
"7905",297,"can watch a movie or they can play video","ep016"
"7906",300,"games we also want to make sure that we","ep016"
"7907",303,"have a nice chefs type kitchen a","ep016"
"7908",306,"top-of-the-line kitchen is important to","ep016"
"7909",309,"both of us because we both love to cook","ep016"
"7910",312,"we would also love a home with a yard","ep016"
"7911",315,"for our dog and of course the boys as","ep016"
"7912",318,"well well I definitely wouldn't mind","ep016"
"7913",321,"considering something that needed a","ep016"
"7914",324,"little bit of work I mean it's not a ton","ep016"
"7915",327,"of work I do not want to have to do any","ep016"
"7916",330,"work to the home we just remodel the","ep016"
"7917",333,"kitchen in Texas and I do not want to go","ep016"
"7918",336,"through that again I am really nervous","ep016"
"7919",339,"to not find something that we really","ep016"
"7920",342,"love the last thing I want to do is","ep016"
"7921",345,"spend a lot of money on a home that","ep016"
"7922",348,"doesn't fit our needs first up they're","ep016"
"7923",351,"seeing a home close to their target area","ep016"
"7924",354,"in Lakeview I love this neighborhood","ep016"
"7925",357,"yeah I mean it's very close to the kids","ep016"
"7926",360,"school for sure but I do notice that","ep016"
"7927",363,"this is a very busy street it is a very","ep016"
"7928",366,"busy street this must be the place right","ep016"
"7929",369,"here is it yeah I different don't love","ep016"
"7930",372,"it definitely not the craftsman I was","ep016"
"7931",375,"looking for it's not contemporary or","ep016"
"7932",378,"craftsman","ep016"
"7933",381,"so I noticed that this is like off a","ep016"
"7934",384,"really busy street it is one of the main","ep016"
"7935",387,"streets that get you in and out of the","ep016"
"7936",390,"city but what's nice is it also makes it","ep016"
"7937",393,"easier for any of your daily commute","ep016"
"7938",396,"this is a three-bedroom","ep016"
"7939",399,"two-and-a-half-bath property listed at","ep016"
"7940",402,"$615,000 that's what our range it feels","ep016"
"7941",405,"like a single-family home although it is","ep016"
"7942",408,"technically a town okay is the shared","ep016"
"7943",411,"wall I know you didn't really want that","ep016"
"7944",414,"no not really","ep016"
"7945",417,"six hundred and fifteen thousand dollars","ep016"
"7946",420,"in Texas would get us like seven bedroom","ep016"
"7947",423,"mansion on a huge lot so how this home","ep016"
"7948",426,"is set up you've got the living area","ep016"
"7949",429,"down here as we move up you'll see the","ep016"
"7950",432,"second one so this is one of two living","ep016"
"7951",435,"areas correct okay this flooring is","ep016"
"7952",438,"definitely like a nice slate look I mean","ep016"
"7953",441,"it definitely looks more modern and you","ep016"
"7954",444,"have this very place it's electric yeah","ep016"
"7955",447,"I think in Texas this qualifies as an","ep016"
"7956",450,"arc tub I don't know that that would be","ep016"
"7957",453,"considered fireplace in Texas I really","ep016"
"7958",456,"like the purple I do not like the purple","ep016"
"7959",459,"it is quite ugly that's an easy fix","ep016"
"7960",462,"right absolutely another neat little","ep016"
"7961",465,"feature of this property is you have a","ep016"
"7962",468,"private wine room oh that you have you","ep016"
"7963",471,"know I I don't know about the pea here I","ep016"
"7964",474,"hate this tile I like it you're not","ep016"
"7965",477,"gonna find this in every other house","ep016"
"7966",480,"there's a half bath which is nice on the","ep016"
"7967",483,"bottom floor to have that for your","ep016"
"7968",486,"guests it's very well done very well","ep016"
"7969",489,"finished very modern first bedroom this","ep016"
"7970",492,"is the only bedroom down here it is so","ep016"
"7971",495,"then Ethan probably cuz he's the oldest","ep016"
"7972",498,"would have to be down here by himself I","ep016"
"7973",501,"mean I'm sure he would love it it's just","ep016"
"7974",504,"you know mama bear is like wanting him","ep016"
"7975",507,"closer to where we we are gonna be but","ep016"
"7976",510,"something consider as we take a look at","ep016"
"7977",513,"the rest of the place for sure and I","ep016"
"7978",516,"think I'm gonna take you outside since","ep016"
"7979",519,"we're down on this level now okay this","ep016"
"7980",522,"is a townhouse so you have the shared","ep016"
"7981",525,"wall and this would be the second","ep016"
"7982",528,"townhome oh well that's not bad though","ep016"
"7983",531,"it's not like it's right next to you","ep016"
"7984",534,"it's behind you so this jack","ep016"
"7985",537,"oh it's all common area we could put our","ep016"
"7986",540,"patio furniture and","ep016"
"7987",543,"barbeque pit out here you got it as long","ep016"
"7988",546,"as I get invited and there's a garage as","ep016"
"7989",549,"well there is a garage so this townhome","ep016"
"7990",552,"comes with one garage spot so you get","ep016"
"7991",555,"half of the garage and they get the","ep016"
"7992",558,"other that might be an issue for you cuz","ep016"

"8032",678,"really ideal either you are making the","ep016"
"8033",681,"transition from Texas here to City and","ep016"
"8034",684,"so with that there's going to be some","ep016"
"8035",687,"compromises especially when it comes","ep016"
"8036",690,"down to the space and the layout of the","ep016"
"8037",693,"properties so alex is showing them","ep016"
"8038",696,"another potential compromise it is that","ep016"
"8039",699,"modern contemporary style that you were","ep016"
"8040",702,"looking for I love it that he was","ep016"
"8041",705,"looking for","ep016"

"8053",741,"they're seeing a home outside their","ep016"
"8054",744,"target area in Logan Square I'm more","ep016"
"8055",747,"concerned about the distance that was","ep016"
"8056",750,"what do you think about 15-20 minutes","ep016"
"8057",753,"yeah when I envisioned a modern home in","ep016"

"8068",786,"we've got the floor-to-ceiling windows","ep016"
"8069",789,"over here that brings in a ton of","ep016"
"8070",792,"natural light this house doesn't have","ep016"
"8071",795,"any sort of character it's just overall","ep016"
"8072",798,"very sterile very boring this is","ep016"
"8073",801,"definitely not the chef's style like we","ep016"
"8074",804,"saw yesterday","ep016"
"8075",807,"no but it's updated for sure I love the","ep016"

"8146",1020,"love to see a Craftsman style home you","ep016"
"8147",1023,"just have to be willing to maybe make","ep016"
"8148",1026,"some compromises and I know you feel","ep016"
"8149",1029,"like you're already doing a lot of that","ep016"
"8150",1032,"but welcome to the city mm-hmm so how","ep016"
"8151",1035,"much is Suzanne ready to compromise this","ep016"
"8152",1038,"place was a lot further than I was","ep016"
"8153",1041,"hoping","ep016"
"8154",1044,"oh my god it's beautiful","ep016"
"8155",1047,"[Music]","ep016"
"8156",1050,"Nik and Suzanne have been experiencing","ep016"
"8157",1053,"some sticker shock since moving from","ep016"
"8158",1056,"Texas to Chicago as they've struggled to","ep016"
"8159",1059,"find a single-family home with enough","ep016"
"8160",1062,"space and a yard for their families","ep016"
"8161",1065,"priced under six hundred and fifty","ep016"
"8162",1068,"thousand dollars so far they've seen a","ep016"
"8163",1071,"townhome with no yard in their target","ep016"
"8164",1074,"area and a single-family home that was","ep016"
"8165",1077,"farther out and didn't have the","ep016"
"8166",1080,"Craftsman style Suzanne is hoping for","ep016"
"8167",1083,"today they're seeing a home in Irving","ep016"
"8168",1086,"Park over 30 minutes from their target","ep016"
"8169",1089,"area so this place was a lot further","ep016"
"8170",1092,"than I was hoping I think this is","ep016"
"8171",1095,"definitely a questionable as far as","ep016"
"8172",1098,"being able to get to the kids school on","ep016"
"8173",1101,"time every morning what do you think oh","ep016"
"8174",1104,"my god it's beautiful","ep016"
"8175",1107,"this is exactly the Craftsman style home","ep016"
"8176",1110,"you were picturing yeah it's not exactly","ep016"
"8177",1113,"the modern home I was hoping for feeling","ep016"
"8178",1116,"the love four bedrooms three and a half","ep016"
"8179",1119,"baths oh that's a lot of space it is at","ep016"
"8180",1122,"the top of your budget at six hundred","ep016"
"8181",1125,"and fifty thousand it's pretty high to","ep016"
"8182",1128,"be so far out away from the kids school","ep016"
"8183",1131,"and but we'll take it here we go oh wow","ep016"
"8184",1134,"look at this this is coffered ceilings","ep016"
"8185",1137,"this is definitely the Craftsman style","ep016"
"8186",1140,"home she was looking for it and it's new","ep016"
"8187",1143,"it's updated so it gives you a little","ep016"
"8188",1146,"bit of a modern feel to it","ep016"
"8189",1149,"but I don't see any place to put like a","ep016"
"8190",1152,"television first starters I don't care I","ep016"
"8191",1155,"mean well you should we'll find a spot","ep016"
"8192",1158,"for the TV there is a downstairs area so","ep016"
"8193",1161,"you could really make that into your","ep016"
"8194",1164,"family space where you'd be watching the","ep016"
"8195",1167,"television oh my god just look at this","ep016"
"8196",1170,"kitchen this is your chef's kitchen","ep016"
"8197",1173,"I love the vent hood I love the big gas","ep016"
"8198",1176,"burner or something that's very nice I","ep016"
"8199",1179,"immediately am drawn to the backsplash","ep016"
"8200",1182,"custom tiles and the countertops are","ep016"
"8201",1185,"Carrara marble I love this big beautiful","ep016"
"8202",1188,"island I mean I could see the kids","ep016"
"8203",1191,"sitting here and doing homework you're","ep016"
"8204",1194,"eating or whatever right and you do have","ep016"
"8205",1197,"a modern light fixture it is","ep016"
"8206",1200,"it's not space-age well I did want to","ep016"
"8207",1203,"point out one less great feature and","ep016"
"8208",1206,"that is the half bath that's over here","ep016"
"8209",1209,"yeah this is really pretty I just love","ep016"
"8210",1212,"all of the detail the craftsmanship","ep016"

"8212",1218,"the crown molding in the bathroom it's","ep016"
"8213",1221,"just beautiful and I do want to show you","ep016"
"8214",1224,"we have a gorgeous backyard I honestly","ep016"
"8215",1227,"don't care if it's a patch of dirt at","ep016"
"8216",1230,"this point wow this is a yard yeah this","ep016"
"8217",1233,"is great this is definitely the biggest","ep016"
"8218",1236,"yard we've seen so far this is what you","ep016"
"8219",1239,"get when you go a little bit north yeah","ep016"
"8220",1242,"I mean the dog would love it out here","ep016"
"8221",1245,"and that looks like a brand-new two-car","ep016"
"8222",1248,"garage as well","ep016"
"8223",1251,"yeah they head back in and down to the","ep016"
"8224",1254,"finished basement it's new and updated","ep016"
"8225",1257,"it's just very small for a game room I","ep016"
"8226",1260,"mean the kids couldn't really run around","ep016"
"8227",1263,"too much in here it's not small there's","ep016"
"8228",1266,"a big couch in two chairs and a coffee","ep016"
"8229",1269,"two other properties it's small they see","ep016"
"8230",1272,"a bedroom and bath in the basement then","ep016"

"8239",1299,"enough to know I want a bathtub in my","ep016"
"8240",1302,"bathroom","ep016"
"8241",1305,"since you have the tub right next door","ep016"
"8242",1308,"you can utilize that yeah exactly that's","ep016"
"8243",1311,"a lot of compromising room for both you","ep016"
"8244",1314,"know and tables yeah yeah I will say","ep016"
"8245",1317,"this would definitely fit our furniture","ep016"
"8246",1320,"and do I see two closet closet that's","ep016"

"8251",1335,"nice to be crazy to say it wasn't","ep016"
"8252",1338,"I just don't that it hits everything on","ep016"
"8253",1341,"the wishlist that we need plus being so","ep016"
"8254",1344,"far it's like we're compromising a lot","ep016"
"8255",1347,"of things if I was gonna be at the top","ep016"
"8256",1350,"of the budget","ep016"
"8257",1353,"I'd want either everything on the wish","ep016"
"8258",1356,"list done or to be a lot closer to where","ep016"
"8259",1359,"we want to be after seeing several","ep016"
"8260",1362,"options it won't be an easy decision for","ep016"
"8261",1365,"Nick and Suzanne their choice may come","ep016"
"8262",1368,"down to location style and single family","ep016"
"8263",1371,"versus townhome I'm not sure I just","ep016"
"8264",1374,"can't believe it's taking this long","ep016"
"8265",1377,"[Music]","ep016"
"8266",1380,"Suzanne and Nick have seen how much","ep016"
"8267",1383,"house six hundred and fifty thousand","ep016"
"8268",1386,"dollars will get them in Chicago now","ep016"
"8269",1389,"it's time to decide let's start with","ep016"
"8270",1392,"that three-story townhome over in","ep016"
"8271",1395,"Lakeview that one was 615 so it was in","ep016"
"8272",1398,"the middle of our budget the open floor","ep016"
"8273",1401,"plan was great and that kitchen was","ep016"
"8274",1404,"amazing","ep016"
"8275",1407,"it wasn't Lincoln Park but really just","ep016"
"8276",1410,"right across the street we were in","ep016"
"8277",1413,"Lincoln Park close to the kids school","ep016"
"8278",1416,"and their friends it wasn't really","ep016"
"8279",1419,"either of our Styles Oh Ethan's room or","ep016"
"8280",1422,"one bedroom is down in the basement and","ep016"
"8281",1425,"then the full bathrooms were all the way","ep016"
"8282",1428,"on the third floor and it only had a one","ep016"
"8283",1431,"car garage let's talk about the modern","ep016"
"8284",1434,"contemporary home at 599 which is below","ep016"
"8285",1437,"our budget","ep016"
"8286",1440,"it was fantastic I mean it was a modern","ep016"
"8287",1443,"contemporary look and it's a","ep016"
"8288",1446,"single-family home II mean that was a","ep016"
"8289",1449,"great option yeah but that house was","ep016"
"8290",1452,"almost kind of sterile looking the","ep016"
"8291",1455,"kitchen just lacked a lot of character","ep016"
"8292",1458,"there wasn't really any yard space in","ep016"
"8293",1461,"the back to me the distance alone is a","ep016"
"8294",1464,"con for sure but that basement was","ep016"
"8295",1467,"unbelievable in that house I mean there","ep016"
"8296",1470,"was a huge space so it's time to talk","ep016"
"8297",1473,"about my favorite home the Craftsman","ep016"
"8298",1476,"style priced at 650,000 it's an every","ep016"

"8994",546,"great and it doesn't really feel like","ep018"
"8995",549,"there would be a lot to do to kind of","ep018"
"8996",552,"make it home I guess I envisioned it","ep018"
"8997",555,"just a little bit bigger","ep018"
"8998",558,"definitely the neighbors are too close","ep018"
"8999",561,"for me okay for me this has probably","ep018"
"9000",564,"about an 8 out of 10 for me it's","ep018"
"9001",567,"probably a 4 out of 10 I just have","ep018"
"9002",570,"certain standards pretty high standards","ep018"

"9004",576,"sync on its own yeah","ep018"
"9005",579,"Wow and what circumstance would anyone","ep018"
"9006",582,"be in but I'd have to jump up in the","ep018"
"9007",585,"middle of the night and just start","ep018"
"9008",588,"washing their hands wrongly I envisioned","ep018"
"9009",591,"my life in Ireland a lot calmer just a","ep018"
"9010",594,"slower pace of life it'll be a lot more","ep018"
"9011",597,"family time come on David I'm looking","ep018"
"9012",600,"forward to spend more time two kids so","ep018"
"9013",603,"that's gonna be something that's a huge","ep018"
"9014",606,"change first Peter and Susie Brown","ep018"
"9015",609,"decided that this is the time to leave","ep018"
"9016",612,"home and career in Houston for a","ep018"
"9017",615,"different life you can get so wrapped up","ep018"
"9018",618,"in money and belongings and things in","ep018"
"9019",621,"life and we just need to put the brakes","ep018"
"9020",624,"on and recognize what's most important","ep018"
"9021",627,"in life and I think that's what this","ep018"
"9022",630,"move is about","ep018"
"9023",633,"so with three-year-old David and","ep018"
"9024",636,"two-year-old Emma they've come to find a","ep018"
"9025",639,"home in Graystone's on the Irish coast","ep018"
"9026",642,"where Peter grew up but while Peter's","ep018"
"9027",645,"main concern is price what are we","ep018"
"9028",648,"looking for in our house in Ireland","ep018"
"9029",651,"cheap we need something with the lowest","ep018"
"9030",654,"price I don't have a job we've got a","ep018"
"9031",657,"finite budget Susie has other priorities","ep018"
"9032",660,"the most important item on Susan's wish","ep018"
"9033",663,"list is that it would be a detached","ep018"
"9034",666,"house and then I would have a nice big","ep018"
"9035",669,"back garden house one has lots of Appeal","ep018"
"9036",672,"for Peter I like it it's got some nice","ep018"
"9037",675,"space in the back here the kids could","ep018"
"9038",678,"definitely play out here it's right on","ep018"
"9039",681,"budget which is really great but Susie's","ep018"
"9040",684,"looking for something more I guess I","ep018"
"9041",687,"envisioned it just a little bit bigger","ep018"
"9042",690,"and definitely the neighbors are too","ep018"
"9043",693,"close for me so the next house I'm gonna","ep018"
"9044",696,"bring them closer to the town it's a","ep018"
"9045",699,"family neighborhood but it's over budget","ep018"
"9046",702,"and I'm not sure what Peter's gonna say","ep018"
"9047",705,"and the location was the most important","ep018"
"9048",708,"thing for her so this one's the garden","ep018"
"9049",711,"house wow it's big wow that is beautiful","ep018"

"9086",822,"something to compromise on yeah I don't","ep018"
"9087",825,"we're looking for a lot of projects to","ep018"
"9088",828,"do this is probably keep an open mind","ep018"

"9107",885,"room a little bit I don't like that very","ep018"
"9108",888,"much","ep018"
"9109",891,"I think we might just have to paint it","ep018"
"9110",894,"or something yeah I don't know I think","ep018"
"9111",897,"that's another project on the list and","ep018"
"9112",900,"more money that you're spending again","ep018"
"9113",903,"that we don't have look at the rest okay","ep018"
"9114",906,"this is set up as the guest bedroom but","ep018"
"9115",909,"it's a really good-size bedroom - yeah","ep018"
"9116",912,"what is that it's actually not that","ep018"
"9117",915,"unusual to have a sink in some of the","ep018"
"9118",918,"bedrooms it's just a sink on its own","ep018"
"9119",921,"yeah Wow in what circumstance would","ep018"
"9120",924,"anyone be in but I'd have to jump up in","ep018"
"9121",927,"the middle of the night and just start","ep018"
"9122",930,"washing their hands around Leigh what do","ep018"
"9123",933,"you think of this bathroom it's","ep018"
"9124",936,"renovated but it just doesn't fit in the","ep018"
"9125",939,"house I know it's not in keeping with","ep018"
"9126",942,"the style but at least you have all new","ep018"
"9127",945,"appliances yeah true that's great in on","ep018"
"9128",948,"and recall this a conservatory","ep018"
"9129",951,"okay in the US we call this a sunroom","ep018"

"9135",969,"what you think I love it I think it's","ep018"
"9136",972,"perfect there's a few things I would","ep018"
"9137",975,"change but I love that it's close","ep018"
"9138",978,"proximity to town I love that it has a","ep018"
"9139",981,"country kitchen this conservatory is","ep018"
"9140",984,"amazing it's just gorgeous it's perfect","ep018"
"9141",987,"for me yeah it's a great house it's a","ep018"
"9142",990,"great size it's got a great garden but","ep018"
"9143",993,"it's over priced and it's starting to","ep018"
"9144",996,"feel like it's a bit of a money pit with","ep018"
"9145",999,"all the repairs I potentially might be","ep018"
"9146",1002,"needed Peter don't you think for","ep018"
"9147",1005,"location wise that the price fits this","ep018"
"9148",1008,"and also you're probably going to be","ep018"
"9149",1011,"meeting mums in this area you know","ep018"
"9150",1014,"you're walking distance to the village","ep018"
"9151",1017,"so it might be worth just paying that","ep018"
"9152",1020,"couple of hundred extra per month for","ep018"
"9153",1023,"the next house can you at all possible","ep018"
"9154",1026,"find something that's at or even below","ep018"
"9155",1029,"our budget why do you have something in","ep018"
"9156",1032,"mind","ep018"
"9157",1035,"please they follow me okay I told Roz","ep018"
"9158",1038,"and I are friends I thought she had my","ep018"
"9159",1041,"back and she understood what we need but","ep018"
"9160",1044,"that's obviously gone completely haywire","ep018"
"9161",1047,"at this point Pisa keeps asking for a","ep018"
"9162",1050,"cheaper house now I'm happy to oblige","ep018"
"9163",1053,"there really isn't of you it's all","ep018"
"9164",1056,"defense it's not exactly what I had in","ep018"
"9165",1059,"mind","ep018"
"9166",1062,"I can't see any of Ireland all I see it","ep018"

"9178",1098,"there and that's where a lot of my","ep018"
"9179",1101,"friends are and as we've gone back for","ep018"

"9181",1107,"to spend some more time with themselves","ep018"

"9184",1116,"Ireland after being in America we're","ep018"

"9186",1122,"agree that gray stones is the right","ep018"
"9187",1125,"location finding the right house isn't","ep018"
"9188",1128,"so easy","ep018"
"9189",1131,"Peter and Susie are actually being","ep018"
"9190",1134,"educated along the tour for Irish homes","ep018"
"9191",1137,"Peter left his job in Texas to make this","ep018"

"9197",1155,"Susy their family home has to offer more","ep018"
"9198",1158,"than a good price it just looks a little","ep018"
"9199",1161,"bit small Roz brought the hunt closer to","ep018"

"9231",1257,"like it could be anywhere I love the sea","ep018"
"9232",1260,"view it's absolutely stunning but I","ep018"

"9239",1281,"we came from the polar opposite which","ep018"
"9240",1284,"was Texas it's a row house and that's","ep018"
"9241",1287,"not one of the things that I can","ep018"
"9242",1290,"compromise on growing up in Ireland I","ep018"
"9243",1293,"had something like this it was a row","ep018"

"9257",1335,"a nice countertop and some space there","ep018"
"9258",1338,"for the children to sit but yeah it's","ep018"

"9267",1365,"all I see it as a dark fence garden","ep018"

"9280",1404,"small bedroom they'll Peter but with","ep018"

"9282",1410,"look how much it feels expanding at the","ep018"
"9283",1413,"end of the day it's the right price it's","ep018"
"9284",1416,"kind of a big compromise we'd have to","ep018"
"9285",1419,"buy a new bed on the right you've got","ep018"
"9286",1422,"the guest bedroom and I don't let me","ep018"

"9345",1599,"the modern home for me was it was too","ep018"
"9346",1602,"far away I mean there was no walking","ep018"
"9347",1605,"distance to that home if I start driving","ep018"
"9348",1608,"that might just make things a little bit","ep018"
"9349",1611,"easier with the garden house would be","ep018"

"9520",225,"water as much as we can I think that","ep019"
"9521",228,"would be","ep019"
"9522",231,"this one's definitely that Spanish","ep019"
"9523",234,"Mediterranean style I like with arches","ep019"
"9524",237,"you have your balcony","ep019"
"9525",240,"Milan car says what are you supposed to","ep019"
"9526",243,"do on this balcony like is is that","ep019"
"9527",246,"hopper like you just do Shakespeare have","ep019"
"9528",249,"a cup of coffee growing up on the East","ep019"
"9529",252,"Coast there really wasn't anything that","ep019"
"9530",255,"looked like a Spanish Mediterranean","ep019"
"9531",258,"style house very different very unique","ep019"
"9532",261,"makes me feel that I'm definitely in the","ep019"
"9533",264,"salsa what I was hoping for is something","ep019"
"9534",267,"kind of like a loft type feel or even","ep019"
"9535",270,"like a industrial where you have the","ep019"
"9536",273,"open brick but just more of a kind of a","ep019"
"9537",276,"cleaner look to it that's like the cool","ep019"
"9538",279,"fun space that you work at but not where","ep019"
"9539",282,"you like live the home has to have at","ep019"
"9540",285,"least three bedrooms and two baths and","ep019"
"9541",288,"Cory wants an additional room for a","ep019"
"9542",291,"dedicated office if I can do work in the","ep019"
"9543",294,"peace and quiet and Jenn doesn't have to","ep019"
"9544",297,"worry about me hanging around her on the","ep019"
"9545",300,"couch with my laptop open she's all","ep019"
"9546",303,"about a formal dining room I come from a","ep019"
"9547",306,"very large Italian family we would","ep019"
"9548",309,"always do Christmases Thanksgivings","ep019"
"9549",312,"together I'm just having that fate would","ep019"
"9550",315,"be nice for one family would come over","ep019"
"9551",318,"this one looks like very regal like I","ep019"
"9552",321,"feel like we would host the Queen I","ep019"
"9553",324,"should come over and have dinner with us","ep019"
"9554",327,"I would love to have a large kitchen I","ep019"
"9555",330,"love to cook so we can have all of our","ep019"
"9556",333,"friends and families over for the","ep019"
"9557",336,"holidays the kitchen also needs to be","ep019"
"9558",339,"updated with stainless steel appliances","ep019"
"9559",342,"and a large center island now that's","ep019"
"9560",345,"definitely what I'm looking for and not","ep019"
"9561",348,"to be forgotten is a spacious yard for","ep019"
"9562",351,"their husky pie boy","ep019"
"9563",354,"he was found in Delaware wandering the","ep019"
"9564",357,"street we found him kind of fell in love","ep019"
"9565",360,"with him right away you know he's been a","ep019"
"9566",363,"integral part of our life since we've","ep019"
"9567",366,"been together","ep019"
"9568",369,"sorry buddy I didn't get a for you I","ep019"
"9569",372,"know maybe we'll give you a little taste","ep019"
"9570",375,"later when you kind of look at the","ep019"
"9571",378,"Austin market to be competitive and to","ep019"
"9572",381,"hopefully get something that has a lot","ep019"
"9573",384,"of the things that we're looking for","ep019"
"9574",387,"my guess is we'll probably end up having","ep019"
"9575",390,"to fall somewhere in the 400 or 450","ep019"
"9576",393,"thousand range but I'm just more","ep019"
"9577",396,"comfortable staying for us first up they","ep019"
"9578",399,"head out to the Lake Travis area to see","ep019"
"9579",402,"something their broker hopes Jen likes","ep019"
"9580",405,"so this community in particular just","ep019"
"9581",408,"happens to have a lot of spanish-style","ep019"
"9582",411,"houses so if you're particularly wanting","ep019"
"9583",414,"a spanish-style this is kind of the","ep019"
"9584",417,"community you're gonna be looking in we","ep019"
"9585",420,"are really close to the lake which is","ep019"
"9586",423,"really nice but Brook this is about as","ep019"
"9587",426,"polar-opposite as we did from what I was","ep019"
"9588",429,"asking so well we got to give Jen a","ep019"
"9589",432,"little bit of what you","ep019"
"9590",435,"right yeah so this house is a","ep019"
"9591",438,"three-bedroom two-bathroom and it's well","ep019"
"9592",441,"under budget at 375 Thanks oh good start","ep019"
"9593",444,"yeah let's check it out perfect come on","ep019"
"9594",447,"Wow","ep019"
"9595",450,"so it definitely still has that Spanish","ep019"
"9596",453,"Mediterranean feel on the inside of you","ep019"
"9597",456,"look at the archways and everything and","ep019"
"9598",459,"I mean the doors pretty cool for me I","ep019"
"9599",462,"was looking for something with a little","ep019"
"9600",465,"bit more character a little bit more","ep019"
"9601",468,"fuel of kind of downtown of a design","ep019"
"9602",471,"architecture that comes with that I mean","ep019"
"9603",474,"you see you have your fireplace which is","ep019"
"9604",477,"definitely important it was brutal bare","ep019"
"9605",480,"winters here in Central Texas yeah so it","ep019"
"9606",483,"looks like that I don't get a dining","ep019"
"9607",486,"room in this house no formal dining room","ep019"
"9608",489,"you do have like the breakfast area over","ep019"
"9609",492,"here it probably is big enough to fit a","ep019"
"9610",495,"full-size table yeah I mean you","ep019"
"9611",498,"definitely have enough space even with","ep019"
"9612",501,"the bay window it kind of gives it a","ep019"
"9613",504,"little bit extra but you kind of like it","ep019"
"9614",507,"looks like a galley kitchen that we have","ep019"
"9615",510,"here and I don't see the island you're","ep019"
"9616",513,"looking for yeah I don't know if it's","ep019"
"9617",516,"the big grand kitchen that I was hoping","ep019"
"9618",519,"for but at least this amount of","ep019"
"9619",522,"countertop space which is nice we have","ep019"
"9620",525,"all the stainless steel appliances which","ep019"
"9621",528,"is good definitely an upgrade","ep019"
"9622",531,"no it'll be nicer finishes last","ep019"
"9623",534,"materials so that is one less expense","ep019"
"9624",537,"potentially we would be looking at oh","ep019"
"9625",540,"[Music]","ep019"
"9626",543,"wow I mean this is definitely a big","ep019"
"9627",546,"patio porch area which is really nice we","ep019"
"9628",549,"could even close this in if we wanted to","ep019"
"9629",552,"make it like a really nice screened-in","ep019"
"9630",555,"porch yeah you like how this is elevated","ep019"
"9631",558,"up it kind of looks over the backyard","ep019"
"9632",561,"I'm not sure how your thoughts on this","ep019"
"9633",564,"but it's clearly sloped into our","ep019"
"9634",567,"neighbor's yard yeah I mean it would be","ep019"
"9635",570,"a little tricky hopefully all the water","ep019"
"9636",573,"we draining into our neighbor's yard","ep019"
"9637",576,"back inside they peek in on a guest bath","ep019"
"9638",579,"and bed before looking at the second","ep019"
"9639",582,"spare room yeah I would probably office","ep019"
"9640",585,"just because they're only two extra","ep019"
"9641",588,"bedrooms I don't know if we would have a","ep019"
"9642",591,"designated office I mean with kids in","ep019"
"9643",594,"the future people coming to visit if we","ep019"
"9644",597,"were to buy this house I think we would","ep019"
"9645",600,"have to convert one of the bedrooms into","ep019"
"9646",603,"an office it's gonna limit us greatly","ep019"
"9647",606,"with regards to space as we grow and","ep019"
"9648",609,"have a family I think we both have to","ep019"
"9649",612,"compromise a little bit on square","ep019"
"9650",615,"footage but it is the style that I was","ep019"
"9651",618,"looking for so again that may just be a","ep019"
"9652",621,"compromise they crossed through the","ep019"
"9653",624,"living room to the master and in this","ep019"
"9654",627,"nice - that there's doors to go right","ep019"
"9655",630,"out to the balcony","ep019"
"9656",633,"yeah and window treatments I'm not too","ep019"
"9657",636,"fond of uses change oh wow double vanity","ep019"
"9658",639,"which is nice","ep019"
"9659",642,"the thinks are different that's I've","ep019"
"9660",645,"never seen that type of thing before","ep019"
"9661",648,"finishings are definitely nice I'm not","ep019"
"9662",651,"sure if they're a hundred percent our","ep019"
"9663",654,"style mm-hmm","ep019"
"9664",657,"I'm not sure how you feel about this","ep019"
"9665",660,"yeah I mean that's not ideal the fact","ep019"
"9666",663,"that the toilets it's just blindly","ep019"
"9667",666,"opened in the middle of the bathroom","ep019"
"9668",669,"conveniently next to the bathtub in the","ep019"
"9669",672,"shower","ep019"
"9670",675,"to me that just seems like a goofy","ep019"
"9671",678,"layout and just a lot of visibility","ep019"
"9672",681,"issues I felt like a circle curtain or","ep019"
"9673",684,"something right around the toilet it's","ep019"
"9674",687,"definitely that Spanish Mediterranean","ep019"
"9675",690,"look that I was going for","ep019"
"9676",693,"um location wise I mean it would be","ep019"
"9677",696,"great we're out by the lake but this was","ep019"
"9678",699,"really not my style and then you know we","ep019"
"9679",702,"only have two additional bedrooms here","ep019"
"9680",705,"outside of the master both are small","ep019"
"9681",708,"spaces and so you gotta think about it","ep019"
"9682",711,"once one of those becomes an office I","ep019"
"9683",714,"mean if we have kids in the future and","ep019"
"9684",717,"we're gonna we're gonna have gross space","ep019"
"9685",720,"pretty quickly yeah it is a nice","ep019"
"9686",723,"backyard good space for the kids","ep019"
"9687",726,"potentially to play in the future and","ep019"
"9688",729,"for kind of have right now it is way","ep019"
"9689",732,"under budget for both of us so that","ep019"
"9690",735,"would be great I mean we would still","ep019"
"9691",738,"potentially have some money left over to","ep019"
"9692",741,"change the things we wanted right away","ep019"
"9693",744,"you know ideally if we can I'd love to","ep019"
"9694",747,"see a property closer to downtown Austin","ep019"
"9695",750,"a little bit more my style and again my","ep019"
"9696",753,"little bit bigger as well you know this","ep019"
"9697",756,"is just gonna look nice","ep019"
"9698",759,"[Music]","ep019"
"9699",762,"so Brooke lines up a property","ep019"
"9700",765,"tailor-made for Corey I mean I love this","ep019"
"9701",768,"Brooke it has definitely the clean","ep019"
"9702",771,"design and look feel to it gorgeous day","ep019"
"9703",774,"out this is the down here Jana and Cory","ep019"
"9704",777,"just moved to Austin Texas and they're","ep019"
"9705",780,"looking for their first home with a four","ep019"
"9706",783,"hundred and fifty thousand dollar max","ep019"
"9707",786,"budget so far they've seen a home in one","ep019"
"9708",789,"of their preferred areas Lake Travis","ep019"
"9709",792,"listed for three hundred and","ep019"
"9710",795,"seventy-five thousand dollars it's the","ep019"
"9711",798,"Spanish style she really wants but it","ep019"
"9712",801,"lacks the hip modern vibe he likes so","ep019"
"9713",804,"today their brokers found a house that's","ep019"
"9714",807,"more Corey's taste close to downtown I","ep019"
"9715",810,"mean I love this Brooke it has","ep019"
"9716",813,"definitely the metal siding the clean","ep019"
"9717",816,"design and look feel to it and what is","ep019"
"9718",819,"that noise I'm hearing above us right","ep019"
"9719",822,"now these are just the bugs in Texas","ep019"
"9720",825,"welcome to Texas guys so this house is a","ep019"
"9721",828,"four-bedroom two-bathroom house and it's","ep019"
"9722",831,"listed at 470","ep019"
"9723",834,"Wow yeah a little bit over budget it's a","ep019"
"9724",837,"little over budget but if you want to be","ep019"
"9725",840,"really close to downtown and have the","ep019"
"9726",843,"modern style that Cory you're really","ep019"
"9727",846,"wanting then this is probably the price","ep019"
"9728",849,"range that you're gonna be sitting in","ep019"
"9729",852,"well I'm excited so all right yeah I","ep019"
"9730",855,"mean it's definitely not my style at all","ep019"
"9731",858,"it's a very modern no good to see what","ep019"
"9732",861,"the inside looks like maybe give it a","ep019"
"9733",864,"chance but from the outside I don't know","ep019"
"9734",867,"[Music]","ep019"
"9735",870,"Brooke this is exactly what I was","ep019"
"9736",873,"looking for the modern cool new house","ep019"
"9737",876,"for sure everything's just modern clean","ep019"
"9738",879,"look clean crisp feel to it it has you","ep019"
"9739",882,"know subway tiles which kind of looks","ep019"
"9740",885,"like exposed brick so so far it looks","ep019"
"9741",888,"like dude this is kind of the only place","ep019"
"9742",891,"that we would eat no dining room no","ep019"
"9743",894,"formal dining room but there is enough","ep019"
"9744",897,"room here for a full sized dining room","ep019"
"9745",900,"table and it looks like two in the","ep019"
"9746",903,"kitchen they have some seats around the","ep019"
"9747",906,"island yeah I mean it's and it's a large","ep019"
"9748",909,"island which I know you really were","ep019"
"9749",912,"hoping for so I think that's a bonus I","ep019"
"9750",915,"miss you my only concern just with this","ep019"
"9751",918,"being all white I don't know how easy it","ep019"
"9752",921,"is to stain I kind of make a mess","ep019"
"9753",924,"sometimes when I'm cooking I do love the","ep019"
"9754",927,"the subway tile look I","ep019"
"9755",930,"it's a great contrast with that and then","ep019"
"9756",933,"kind of a clean crisp look of the","ep019"
"9757",936,"kitchen with white cabinets stainless","ep019"
"9758",939,"steel just it has that industrial modern","ep019"
"9759",942,"kind of feel to it it seems to really","ep019"
"9760",945,"resonate well with what I'm looking for","ep019"
"9761",948,"alright well let's go check out the","ep019"
"9762",951,"bedrooms just go down the hall right","ep019"
"9763",954,"here they look in on two guest rooms oh","ep019"
"9764",957,"cool it's a nice little bedroom Jenna","ep019"
"9765",960,"and a bath before seeing the third spare","ep019"
"9766",963,"bedroom I think it's questionable they","ep019"
"9767",966,"actually call us a bedroom okay thanks","ep019"
"9768",969,"it's a it's a tight space it's small","ep019"
"9769",972,"space it would be good for an office","ep019"
"9770",975,"that looks like a door out to the","ep019"
"9771",978,"backyard which is nice so this may be","ep019"
"9772",981,"something to work I can just have his","ep019"
"9773",984,"stuff and maybe this is his room it's","ep019"
"9774",987,"really tiny yeah this would be really","ep019"
"9775",990,"nice not functional for Kai I mean I","ep019"
"9776",993,"guess the one nice thing there really","ep019"
"9777",996,"isn't anybody behind us so we do have","ep019"
"9778",999,"lots of privacy all right I don't know","ep019"
"9779",1002,"yeah back inside they head to the master","ep019"
"9780",1005,"suite so definitely a good-size room","ep019"
"9781",1008,"it's a very bland just kind of sterile","ep019"
"9782",1011,"feeling here so I would definitely Pye","ep019"
"9783",1014,"want to add some color to the wall give","ep019"
"9784",1017,"it maybe a little bit of a more tranquil","ep019"
"9785",1020,"fuel than kind of the sterile white wall","ep019"
"9786",1023,"that's here let's look at the master","ep019"
"9787",1026,"master bathroom so we have double","ep019"
"9788",1029,"vanities which is nice some nice detail","ep019"
"9789",1032,"work with the subway tile yeah I mean","ep019"
"9790",1035,"the subway sounds nice but a bathroom","ep019"
"9791",1038,"it's a little bit on the smaller side","ep019"
"9792",1041,"yeah that's shoot I mean","ep019"
"9793",1044,"it's updated finishings it looks great","ep019"
"9794",1047,"but outside of that you know it's just","ep019"
"9795",1050,"to me it's a standard map","ep019"
"9796",1053,"I mean obviously it really is an","ep019"
"9797",1056,"industrial more modern look and feel","ep019"
"9798",1059,"that I'm looking for the modern look and","ep019"
"9799",1062,"feel of the house that's actually kind","ep019"
"9800",1065,"of growing on me","ep019"
"9801",1068,"I do like it Cory still has an office so","ep019"
"9802",1071,"it's probably a pretty good layout for","ep019"
"9803",1074,"us unfortunately with this house we","ep019"
"9804",1077,"don't have a dining room we do have a","ep019"
"9805",1080,"really big kitchen which is great with a","ep019"
"9806",1083,"really nice Island so that would be","ep019"
"9807",1086,"great for cooking and entertaining my","ep019"
"9808",1089,"baby he's concerned not right off the","ep019"
"9809",1092,"bat it's just the price it's way over my","ep019"
"9810",1095,"budget it's even over Cory's commute","ep019"
"9811",1098,"wise I'd only be a few minutes from the","ep019"
"9812",1101,"office which is ideal I do have concerns","ep019"
"9813",1104,"with the backyard you know that I was","ep019"
"9814",1107,"just hoping we're getting all the more","ep019"
"9815",1110,"yard yeah that's definitely true I mean","ep019"
"9816",1113,"the house is move-in ready","ep019"
"9817",1116,"you really don't need to do anything","ep019"
"9818",1119,"here which is great so again more things","ep019"
"9819",1122,"to take into consideration not convinced","ep019"
"9820",1125,"they head out to look at another house","ep019"
"9821",1128,"but it may be more than what they want","ep019"
"9822",1131,"it's three thousand four hundred and","ep019"
"9823",1134,"fifty square feet that's massive","ep019"
"9824",1137,"[Music]","ep019"
"9825",1140,"careful for cactus especially with them","ep019"
"9826",1143,"these newlyweds are looking to make","ep019"
"9827",1146,"their recent move to Austin Texas","ep019"

"9831",1158,"well-priced spanish-style for Jan in the","ep019"
"9832",1161,"Lake Travis area but its size meant","ep019"
"9833",1164,"they'd have to forfeit a guest room for","ep019"
"9834",1167,"Cory's office then they saw a modern","ep019"
"9835",1170,"style home much closer to downtown that","ep019"
"9836",1173,"fits his style and did have the extra","ep019"
"9837",1176,"room for an office but they both felt","ep019"
"9838",1179,"the yard might be too small for their","ep019"
"9839",1182,"dog Kai and it was over budget today","ep019"
"9840",1185,"they're seeing a home farther out in","ep019"
"9841",1188,"Cedar Park it's about 40 minutes from","ep019"
"9842",1191,"downtown I'm 20 from Lake Travis","ep019"
"9843",1194,"definitely not the Spanish Mediterranean","ep019"
"9844",1197,"I mean it does have the arches which I","ep019"
"9845",1200,"guess is one good part and I do really","ep019"
"9846",1203,"like that limestone it kind of gives us","ep019"
"9847",1206,"that Texas feel I said I wanted exposed","ep019"
"9848",1209,"brick you know I appreciate the","ep019"
"9849",1212,"opportunity here but it's not exactly","ep019"
"9850",1215,"what I was looking for right so this is","ep019"
"9851",1218,"a more traditional style home listed at","ep019"
"9852",1221,"434 so it's a little closer to your","ep019"
"9853",1224,"price range since djinns it's three","ep019"
"9854",1227,"thousand four hundred and fifty square","ep019"
"9855",1230,"feet that's massive it's definitely a","ep019"
"9856",1233,"large house I just don't know if it's","ep019"
"9857",1236,"gonna be too much for us it's a lot to","ep019"
"9858",1239,"clean and maintain oh wow look at this","ep019"
"9859",1242,"holy cow this place goes on and on yeah","ep019"
"9860",1245,"I mean look at all the arches it's kind","ep019"
"9861",1248,"of just finished Mediterranean feel","ep019"
"9862",1251,"almost what room is this boring right","ep019"
"9863",1254,"now so this is the formal living room","ep019"
"9864",1257,"and that's the formal dining room I'm","ep019"
"9865",1260,"not really sure what we would do with a","ep019"
"9866",1263,"formal living room space but I mean just","ep019"
"9867",1266,"because it's so open to the dining room","ep019"
"9868",1269,"that'd be great for if we do get the","ep019"
"9869",1272,"whole family here oh I think you can","ep019"
"9870",1275,"probably a gigantic table in here this","ep019"
"9871",1278,"space right now for dinner oh my","ep019"
"9872",1281,"goodness look at the size of this","ep019"
"9873",1284,"kitchen oh it counts huge on the","ep019"
"9874",1287,"countertop space I'd be perfect I mean","ep019"
"9875",1290,"that's a lot of cabinets and this is","ep019"
"9876",1293,"like a sieve blandness this is something","ep019"
"9877",1296,"I think they put in houses like in the","ep019"
"9878",1299,"90s it's definitely not the style that","ep019"
"9879",1302,"I'm looking for it I don't know if we'd","ep019"
"9880",1305,"have to update everything in here that","ep019"
"9881",1308,"would be a lot of money it's got to be a","ep019"
"9882",1311,"fortune and upgrade all the amenities it","ep019"
"9883",1314,"could be very pricey because of the size","ep019"
"9884",1317,"of the kitchen yeah","ep019"
"9885",1320,"oh my goodness honey look at this look","ep019"
"9886",1323,"at this backyard look at the size of","ep019"
"9887",1326,"this pool oh my goodness this is a nice","ep019"
"9888",1329,"little surprise Wow and you've got some","ep019"
"9889",1332,"great green space over here","ep019"
"9890",1335,"tons of grass for him to run around now","ep019"
"9891",1338,"awesome I was gonna ask you about that","ep019"
"9892",1341,"you know obviously the pool is fantastic","ep019"
"9893",1344,"but where would I have space time honey","ep019"
"9894",1347,"but that's great yeah","ep019"
"9895",1350,"seer Park is a lot further than we are","ep019"
"9896",1353,"hoping to be however when you step foot","ep019"
"9897",1356,"into that backyard and you have the pool","ep019"
"9898",1359,"in the waterfall running it takes you","ep019"
"9899",1362,"out of just the concern of being in one","ep019"
"9900",1365,"location now there it becomes your own","ep019"
"9901",1368,"tropical oasis back inside they had to","ep019"
"9902",1371,"see the home office this is a good","ep019"
"9903",1374,"little space oh wow yeah no there's","ep019"
"9904",1377,"definitely lots of room my only concern","ep019"
"9905",1380,"is you have white walls white ceiling","ep019"
"9906",1383,"white doors I feel like I've gotten was","ep019"
"9907",1386,"like a hospital room they head down the","ep019"
"9908",1389,"hall and see three guest rooms and a","ep019"
"9909",1392,"bath before taking a look at the master","ep019"
"9910",1395,"suite look at this space this is right","ep019"
"9911",1398,"master it is actually it looks like you","ep019"
"9912",1401,"have access out to the backyard from our","ep019"
"9913",1404,"bedroom which is really cool nice you've","ep019"
"9914",1407,"got a really large master bathroom oh","ep019"
"9915",1410,"wow look at the size of this closet","ep019"
"9916",1413,"right here to my right eye bubble sure","ep019"
"9917",1416,"is prob about the same size of my","ep019"
"9918",1419,"brother's apartment in San Francisco the","ep019"
"9919",1422,"counters cabinets everything is kind of","ep019"
"9920",1425,"outdated","ep019"
"9921",1428,"I just don't know again budget wise what","ep019"
"9922",1431,"it would be to redo the whole bathroom","ep019"
"9923",1434,"that's definitely adding up lots of","ep019"
"9924",1437,"dollar signs it's definitely not a loft","ep019"
"9925",1440,"it's definitely not industrial it's not","ep019"
"9926",1443,"the Mediterranean Spanish look you're","ep019"
"9927",1446,"looking for its proximity it's not near","ep019"
"9928",1449,"what we were looking at Rijal you that's","ep019"
"9929",1452,"true I mean it's a huge sprawling house","ep019"
"9930",1455,"I feel like it's almost maybe a little","ep019"
"9931",1458,"bit too much of a house for us yeah the","ep019"
"9932",1461,"nice part though is there was a separate","ep019"
"9933",1464,"area for a office and for the dining","ep019"
"9934",1467,"room","ep019"
"9935",1470,"we can fit all of our friends and family","ep019"
"9936",1473,"in here the backyard is great there's","ep019"
"9937",1476,"definitely space for the dog with the","ep019"
"9938",1479,"side yard there's the pool the","ep019"
"9939",1482,"landscaping which is amazing but that is","ep019"
"9940",1485,"also something new for listen there's","ep019"
"9941",1488,"gonna be ice associated with the","ep019"
"9942",1491,"maintenance of a pool I mean it was a","ep019"
"9943",1494,"gorgeous expansive kitchen but there's","ep019"
"9944",1497,"gonna be upgrades that we have to do in","ep019"
"9945",1500,"there the bathrooms will probably be","ep019"
"9946",1503,"upgraded we're already a little bit","ep019"
"9947",1506,"above where you wanted to be budget wise","ep019"
"9948",1509,"and we're getting close to my maximum","ep019"
"9949",1512,"capacity so we just have to think - this","ep019"
"9950",1515,"could be a pretty decent investment in","ep019"
"9951",1518,"here","ep019"
"9952",1521,"time we'd have to see if that would be","ep019"
"9953",1524,"worth it or not and just what makes one","ep019"
"9954",1527,"of these homes worth it might boil down","ep019"
"9955",1530,"to one of them getting their style space","ep019"
"9956",1533,"for a dining room or being in one of","ep019"
"9957",1536,"their desired locations we essentially","ep019"
"9958",1539,"going to lose a property if we don't","ep019"
"9959",1542,"make a decision quickly","ep019"
"9960",1545,"what you thinking so many good choices","ep019"
"9961",1548,"Cory and Jen are looking to put down","ep019"
"9962",1551,"roots in Austin Texas they've seen","ep019"
"9963",1554,"several options now they have to choose","ep019"
"9964",1557,"the spanish-style house we saw up by","ep019"
"9965",1560,"Luke Travis the sticker price on that","ep019"
"9966",1563,"house was 375 it's only had two guest","ep019"
"9967",1566,"bedrooms I know you really wanted an","ep019"
"9968",1569,"office so we'd have to use one of those","ep019"
"9969",1572,"for that and then there's no dining room","ep019"
"9970",1575,"for me there is a small kitchen area","ep019"
"9971",1578,"that's a house that we can move right","ep019"
"9972",1581,"into which is free this is well under","ep019"
"9973",1584,"our budget we have the opportunity there","ep019"
"9974",1587,"if we want to make some modifications","ep019"
"9975",1590,"the house I know it's a hundred percent","ep019"
"9976",1593,"of style that you're looking for it did","ep019"
"9977",1596,"have a nice backyard yeah that's","ep019"
"9978",1599,"definitely true it's nice and it's very","ep019"
"9979",1602,"convenient that is by Lake Travis which","ep019"
"9980",1605,"you know you know I'd love to be close","ep019"
"9981",1608,"to water if we can and then we saw what","ep019"
"9982",1611,"the industrial modern type home which","ep019"
"9983",1614,"was definitely hundreds of my style","ep019"
"9984",1617,"modern interior actually kind of grew on","ep019"
"9985",1620,"me I did like a lot of the features that","ep019"
"9986",1623,"it had I wouldn't really want to paint","ep019"
"9987",1626,"that house though it's very bland I","ep019"
"9988",1629,"really liked the kitchen","ep019"
"9989",1632,"there was no dining room unfortunately","ep019"
"9990",1635,"but it did have some seating at the","ep019"
"9991",1638,"island because it was so large the","ep019"
"9992",1641,"backyard was super small yeah I mean at","ep019"
"9993",1644,"least in that house we had three","ep019"
"9994",1647,"bedrooms and the master so you had an","ep019"
"9995",1650,"office but just that sticker price for","ep019"
"9996",1653,"that house yeah I mean the convenience","ep019"
"9997",1656,"is it is much closer to work yeah that's","ep019"
"9998",1659,"true you know the traditional home was","ep019"
"9999",1662,"on Cedar Park that's way further out","ep019"
"10000",1665,"than you and I ever were intending to","ep019"
"10001",1668,"live it wasn't a spanish-style home or","ep019"
"10002",1671,"Mediterranean style oh it was definitely","ep019"
"10003",1674,"not industrial loft or modern sajo but","ep019"
"10004",1677,"you know that backyard was incredible","ep019"
"10005",1680,"the backyard is gorgeous that house is a","ep019"
"10006",1683,"little","ep019"
"10007",1686,"over my budget I know it's still within","ep019"
"10008",1689,"yours that one even has a nice big","ep019"
"10009",1692,"dining room the kitchen and the","ep019"
"10010",1695,"bathrooms weren't really exactly what we","ep019"
"10011",1698,"were looking for so again that's gonna","ep019"
"10012",1701,"be more cost I mean that house has more","ep019"
"10013",1704,"space than I think we know what to do","ep019"
"10014",1707,"with I'm not sure how much it would cost","ep019"
"10015",1710,"to heat cool that house we potentially","ep019"
"10016",1713,"going to lose a property if we don't","ep019"
"10017",1716,"make a decision quickly so what are your","ep019"
"10018",1719,"thoughts hey may come as a surprise to","ep019"
"10019",1722,"you but I think that traditional so","ep019"
"10020",1725,"we're going with the traditional I think","ep019"
"10021",1728,"so the beautiful pool it really has","ep019"
"10022",1731,"everything that we're looking for we're","ep019"
"10023",1734,"gonna be able to grow into that house","ep019"
"10024",1737,"and not have to worry about a couple","ep019"
"10025",1740,"years down the road best bang for our","ep019"
"10026",1743,"buck awesome","ep019"
"10027",1746,"well Cheers everything we've been in the","ep019"
"10028",1749,"house now in just under a month and you","ep019"
"10029",1752,"know we're still getting settled we're","ep019"
"10030",1755,"still tryna still try to find stuff it's","ep019"
"10031",1758,"definitely a much bigger kitchen than","ep019"
"10032",1761,"where you see that's for sure I know not","ep019"
"10033",1764,"being able to get the industrial loft","ep019"
"10034",1767,"that I was looking for it was a little","ep019"
"10035",1770,"bit disappointing but it is a nice house","ep019"
"10036",1773,"did check off a lot of boxes are the","ep019"
"10037",1776,"things that I was really looking for I","ep019"
"10038",1779,"did have to give up the Spanish","ep019"
"10039",1782,"Mediterranean style that I was hoping","ep019"
"10040",1785,"for","ep019"
"10041",1788,"it does have some arches which kind of","ep019"
"10042",1791,"plays into that but this house has","ep019"
"10043",1794,"definitely a large kitchen it's not","ep019"
"10044",1797,"exactly updated but it's definitely","ep019"
"10045",1800,"something we can kind of invest in and","ep019"
"10046",1803,"change down the road I think the thing","ep019"
"10047",1806,"that sold me the most on this house was","ep019"
"10048",1809,"really just the fact that we're gonna be","ep019"
"10049",1812,"able to grow into this space whether we","ep019"
"10050",1815,"had more dogs or our children in the","ep019"
"10051",1818,"future it definitely has the flexibility","ep019"
"10052",1821,"to really allow us to expand as a family","ep019"
"10053",1824,"I think after dinner maybe we should get","ep019"
"10054",1827,"some more paint supplies yeah definitely","ep019"
"10055",1830,"sounds like a good idea really the only","ep019"
"10056",1833,"main thing that we've changed so far in","ep019"
"10057",1836,"our house is painting the office I know","ep019"
"10058",1839,"when we first got here it was just very","ep019"
"10059",1842,"white very bling so it's not very green","ep019"
"10060",1845,"you know there definitely are the","ep019"
"10061",1848,"bathrooms that we want to change the","ep019"
"10062",1851,"update that's just something we're gonna","ep019"
"10063",1854,"get to over time I'm not opposed to blue","ep019"
"10064",1857,"I think we gotta tone it down a little","ep019"
"10065",1860,"bit maybe pick one color yeah we are","ep019"
"10066",1863,"definitely greatly enjoying the pool and","ep019"
"10067",1866,"kind really has done great adjusting he","ep019"
"10068",1869,"still has a side yard to run and play","ep019"
"10069",1872,"okay here we go for us this was a pretty","ep019"
"10070",1875,"substantial investment both personally","ep019"
"10071",1878,"but obviously financially as well and it","ep019"
"10072",1881,"is really our Oasis so it's something","ep019"
"10073",1884,"we're not looking to leave anytime in","ep019"
"10074",1887,"the near future","ep019"
"10075",1890,"what's your Sonny this is our our house","ep019"

"10082",24,"entertaining or for kids you can see","ep020"
"10083",27,"them from the kitchen but her priority","ep020"
"10084",30,"is a formal dining space this is our","ep020"
"10085",33,"wasted room that we won't use this is","ep020"
"10086",36,"great and he's more focused on a garage","ep020"
"10087",39,"although third star third stall that's","ep020"
"10088",42,"right","ep020"
"10089",45,"they'll have to find common ground this","ep020"
"10090",48,"is the dining space this space is","ep020"
"10091",51,"perfect for this house hunt could go up","ep020"

"10141",201,"it's time for something bigger as we get","ep020"
"10142",204,"more serious about having a family so","ep020"
"10143",207,"this next house will definitely be our","ep020"

"10161",261,"little bit of a separate area for them","ep020"
"10162",264,"rooms are pretty separate and there's a","ep020"
"10163",267,"formal dining so that's good I don't","ep020"
"10164",270,"think the formal dining room is","ep020"
"10165",273,"necessary I feel like it's a room that","ep020"
"10166",276,"is there for her to decorate but we","ep020"
"10167",279,"would rarely use and I totally disagree","ep020"
"10168",282,"I would love a formal dining space","ep020"

"10171",291,"table and have family suppers I don't","ep020"
"10172",294,"like the color of the cabinets though","ep020"
"10173",297,"white everything would be my ideal","ep020"
"10174",300,"kitchen I don't want an open floor plan","ep020"
"10175",303,"though because otherwise I feel like","ep020"
"10176",306,"it's just one big open space and you","ep020"
"10177",309,"throw a rug in this corner and you call","ep020"

"10182",324,"one that's cute that's a small garage","ep020"
"10183",327,"though I would love to have a","ep020"
"10184",330,"three-stall garage we only have two","ep020"
"10185",333,"vehicles but I've got a lot of tools I","ep020"
"10186",336,"would love to have a big private","ep020"
"10187",339,"backyard and then ideally I would have a","ep020"
"10188",342,"finished basement and since he's six","ep020"
"10189",345,"foot seven he's hoping to find one with","ep020"
"10190",348,"a high ceiling I would love to have a","ep020"

"10192",354,"ambience they bring and I love the smell","ep020"
"10193",357,"of them but I prefer gas just because","ep020"
"10194",360,"wood I feel like it makes your house","ep020"
"10195",363,"smell and it gets smoky and it's a lot","ep020"

"10210",408,"a lot of what Stacy wanted with the","ep020"
"10211",411,"two-story Victorian feel I was hoping it","ep020"
"10212",414,"would be a little more of a Victorian","ep020"
"10213",417,"home but I do like that it's a double","ep020"
"10214",420,"saw garage at least I really wanted to","ep020"

"10218",432,"have to change that do you think this","ep020"
"10219",435,"room kind of gives you that wow factor","ep020"
"10220",438,"with the tall ceilings yeah I wish it","ep020"
"10221",441,"was more hardwood floor throughout all","ep020"
"10222",444,"here but we can work with carpet I","ep020"

"10263",567,"just don't like the look of them not a","ep020"
"10264",570,"fan of the pine trees outside I know we","ep020"
"10265",573,"can rip them out if we want but that's","ep020"
"10266",576,"just more work than I'm looking for it's","ep020"
"10267",579,"gonna be very difficult to find a home","ep020"
"10268",582,"without pine trees in South Dakota","ep020"
"10269",585,"here's the basement the fireplace","ep020"
"10270",588,"another fire gives us a second living","ep020"

"10277",609,"but this would work pretty good for any","ep020"
"10278",612,"lost weight I think there's a another","ep020"
"10279",615,"bathroom here for in-laws - oh thanks","ep020"

"10298",672,"dining there like that's hard to find I","ep020"
"10299",675,"think why I want it to be more openness","ep020"
"10300",678,"because I think we'd utilize the space","ep020"
"10301",681,"better if it was part of the other rooms","ep020"
"10302",684,"you know right the soaker tub is great","ep020"
"10303",687,"but I would really like to see a ranch","ep020"

"10415",1023,"preferred style but Stacey felt it was","ep020"
"10416",1026,"missing the Victorian features he wants","ep020"
"10417",1029,"so now they're headed to another option","ep020"
"10418",1032,"that their agent hopes will win Stacey","ep020"
"10419",1035,"over with some historical features I","ep020"
"10420",1038,"like it it's a little bit older a little","ep020"

"10424",1050,"porch hey we got a nice 2-story here","ep020"
"10425",1053,"it's priced at 189 nine it's a 3-bedroom","ep020"
"10426",1056,"3-bath three-bedroom though I'm not sure","ep020"
"10427",1059,"how I feel about that I really was","ep020"

"10433",1077,"nice I really like the hardwood floors","ep020"
"10434",1080,"right when you walk in it's a little","ep020"
"10435",1083,"tight actually kind of an awkward layout","ep020"
"10436",1086,"a free living room but I've never seen","ep020"
"10437",1089,"these little built-in details which are","ep020"
"10438",1092,"actually really cute it's nice I like","ep020"
"10439",1095,"kind of opens it up to the next area -","ep020"
"10440",1098,"yeah but yet it still kind of separates","ep020"
"10441",1101,"it which was something I was kind of","ep020"
"10442",1104,"looking for so","ep020"
"10443",1107,"I like that those are cool wow this is","ep020"
"10444",1110,"really nice and I love the fact that","ep020"
"10445",1113,"it's not a formal dining room we still","ep020"
"10446",1116,"have our dining space but it's a part of","ep020"
"10447",1119,"everything else so if people are sitting","ep020"
"10448",1122,"at the table you could still be in the","ep020"
"10449",1125,"kitchen I really want my formal dining","ep020"
"10450",1128,"room I can have a whole vision for that","ep020"
"10451",1131,"space and you know this is a nice space","ep020"
"10452",1134,"but it's just not really what I'm","ep020"
"10453",1137,"looking for","ep020"
"10454",1140,"well guys you should check out the","ep020"
"10455",1143,"beautiful kitchen here that's been","ep020"
"10456",1146,"recently remodeled yeah this is","ep020"
"10457",1149,"beautiful it's got the stone countertops","ep020"
"10458",1152,"the tile backsplash and new stainless","ep020"
"10459",1155,"steel appliances it's great if I could","ep020"
"10460",1158,"just take this white kitchen and put it","ep020"
"10461",1161,"in a four bedroom home that would be","ep020"
"10462",1164,"perfect for me oh wow this is really","ep020"
"10463",1167,"nice yeah it's huge it's not super","ep020"
"10464",1170,"private what's going on with this garage","ep020"
"10465",1173,"though yeah so this is a single stop but","ep020"
"10466",1176,"it's double deep so it's it is a","ep020"
"10467",1179,"technically a double stall garage I","ep020"
"10468",1182,"think you found a loophole and my wish","ep020"
"10469",1185,"list for a three stall garage back","ep020"
"10470",1188,"inside they head downstairs to the","ep020"
"10471",1191,"basement oh my gosh this is quite the","ep020"
"10472",1194,"finished basement you were looking for I","ep020"
"10473",1197,"guess there's a lot of extra money in","ep020"
"10474",1200,"the budget we could do some work down","ep020"
"10475",1203,"here but I'm just not even sure I'd want","ep020"
"10476",1206,"to with having to walk down these stairs","ep020"
"10477",1209,"the whole time yeah I absolutely hate","ep020"
"10478",1212,"the basement just way too much work and","ep020"
"10479",1215,"it's work that I don't want to do","ep020"
"10480",1218,"upstairs on the second floor our two","ep020"
"10481",1221,"guest bedrooms and a hall bathroom look","ep020"
"10482",1224,"right into your neighbor's house","ep020"
"10483",1227,"well here's the master this is actually","ep020"
"10484",1230,"a lot bigger than I thought home really","ep020"
"10485",1233,"nice big windows - I like that it's","ep020"
"10486",1236,"awesome natural light","ep020"
"10487",1239,"oh nice any others bathroom yeah this is","ep020"
"10488",1242,"nice","ep020"
"10489",1245,"I hate that there's no room for time in","ep020"
"10490",1248,"the master I want to see Paige happy and","ep020"
"10491",1251,"if it means having a bathtub so be it","ep020"
"10492",1254,"it's not something that is a must for me","ep020"
"10493",1257,"so I could definitely do without it not","ep020"
"10494",1260,"a Victorian but yeah pretty close yeah","ep020"
"10495",1263,"it's got some of the older features that","ep020"
"10496",1266,"I like though with the windows and the","ep020"
"10497",1269,"hardwood yeah it's definitely more your","ep020"
"10498",1272,"style than mine","ep020"
"10499",1275,"one thing I love in this house is that","ep020"
"10500",1278,"kitchen that is perfect 100% my style","ep020"
"10501",1281,"and exactly what I was looking for it I","ep020"
"10502",1284,"mean the basement absolutely sucks I","ep020"
"10503",1287,"can't even walk down there without","ep020"
"10504",1290,"hitting my head I know we're under","ep020"
"10505",1293,"budget but that's just too much work","ep020"
"10506",1296,"plus I didn't get my formal dining room","ep020"
"10507",1299,"or my soaker tub in this house now","ep020"
"10508",1302,"Stacey and Paige will have to decide","ep020"
"10509",1305,"what's most important a formal dining","ep020"
"10510",1308,"room a three-car garage or a renovated","ep020"
"10511",1311,"kitchen","ep020"
"10512",1314,"okay space I think we need to make a","ep020"
"10513",1317,"decision pretty soon","ep020"
"10514",1320,"[Music]","ep020"
"10515",1323,"okay Stace I think we need to make a","ep020"
"10516",1326,"decision pretty soon working with a 250","ep020"
"10517",1329,"thousand dollar budget page and Stacey","ep020"
"10518",1332,"are eager to choose a home for their","ep020"
"10519",1335,"future family okay let's talk about that","ep020"
"10520",1338,"two-story house that was 230 for nine","ep020"
"10521",1341,"one thing I love about that house is it","ep020"
"10522",1344,"has a formal dining room plus it had","ep020"
"10523",1347,"that in-law suite that we're looking for","ep020"
"10524",1350,"in the basement I think that'd be an","ep020"
"10525",1353,"awesome place for our in-laws but I","ep020"
"10526",1356,"would definitely have to be sacrificing","ep020"
"10527",1359,"a three-stall garage and the yard was an","ep020"
"10528",1362,"ideal for me I kind of wanted a big","ep020"
"10529",1365,"private backyard that's kind of more of","ep020"
"10530",1368,"a side yard yeah it had those pine trees","ep020"
"10531",1371,"in the yard which I was not a fan of it","ep020"
"10532",1374,"all well that house had the soaker tub","ep020"
"10533",1377,"and that was something I really wanted","ep020"
"10534",1380,"okay so what do you think about that","ep020"
"10535",1383,"ranch for 249 nine well I obviously love","ep020"
"10536",1386,"that one because it was a ranch and it","ep020"
"10537",1389,"had five bedrooms which is awesome I","ep020"
"10538",1392,"really liked the fact that was the only","ep020"
"10539",1395,"house with three stall garage and that","ep020"
"10540",1398,"yard was was amazing and the kitchen was","ep020"
"10541",1401,"small and there was no formal dining","ep020"
"10542",1404,"right I think there's room for","ep020"
"10543",1407,"improvement with the kitchen there is","ep020"
"10544",1410,"but it's at the top of our budget so","ep020"
"10545",1413,"right that would make things difficult","ep020"
"10546",1416,"let's talk about the historical bungalow","ep020"
"10547",1419,"for one eighty nine nine yeah I really","ep020"
"10548",1422,"like the price on that one it really","ep020"
"10549",1425,"wasn't the Victorian I was looking for","ep020"
"10550",1428,"but it definitely had some of the","ep020"
"10551",1431,"historical feel that I wanted I was","ep020"
"10552",1434,"really bummed about the formal dining","ep020"
"10553",1437,"space in that house I thought it'd be in","ep020"
"10554",1440,"an old home it would probably have one","ep020"
"10555",1443,"but I think maybe I could look past that","ep020"
"10556",1446,"for that kitchen set but it was white","ep020"
"10557",1449,"and has the next countertops it was big","ep020"
"10558",1452,"it didn't have the in-law suite though","ep020"
"10559",1455,"yeah that space didn't have anything any","ep020"
"10560",1458,"basement so no no second living space","ep020"
"10561",1461,"what'd you think about that garage","ep020"
"10562",1464,"though the garage I liked that it was a","ep020"
"10563",1467,"two stall but I didn't like that it was","ep020"
"10564",1470,"a tandem Tucson and there was no tub but","ep020"
"10565",1473,"with the extra room we have in the","ep020"
"10566",1476,"budget I think we could put a tub in","ep020"
"10567",1479,"that extra bathroom so which one will","ep020"
"10568",1482,"they choose","ep020"
"10569",1485,"I think I know which one I want you I","ep020"
"10570",1488,"think so what do you think I'm thinking","ep020"
"10571",1491,"the traditional two-story really yeah","ep020"
"10572",1494,"that's what I like too","ep020"
"10573",1497,"I really like that it's a two-story home","ep020"
"10574",1500,"the bedrooms are separate from our","ep020"
"10575",1503,"entertaining and living space you know","ep020"
"10576",1506,"and I really wanted a ranch but I love","ep020"
"10577",1509,"that it has a formal dining room and it","ep020"
"10578",1512,"did have a soaker tub","ep020"
"10579",1515,"let's call Erin and put an offer in","ep020"
"10580",1518,"let's go call him right now arrived in","ep020"
"10581",1521,"the center underneath I think it turned","ep020"
"10582",1524,"out great I don't - the house was listed","ep020"
"10583",1527,"for 234 nine and we paid a full price at","ep020"
"10584",1530,"234 nine we've been in the house about","ep020"
"10585",1533,"two weeks now and we love being here we","ep020"
"10586",1536,"love the neighborhood it's really quiet","ep020"
"10587",1539,"street and everybody's been really","ep020"
"10588",1542,"welcoming since we've been here oh it's","ep020"
"10589",1545,"windy it's a little windy out today","ep020"
"10590",1548,"there's actually quite a few pieces in","ep020"
"10591",1551,"this house that we've put our own little","ep020"
"10592",1554,"touch on from either finding it at","ep020"
"10593",1557,"antique stores or flea markets I think","ep020"
"10594",1560,"this is the perfect spot for the lamp we","ep020"
"10595",1563,"found at the thrift store that was a","ep020"
"10596",1566,"good find","ep020"
"10597",1569,"it's really feeling like home now that","ep020"
"10598",1572,"everything's kind of decorate","ep020"
"10599",12,"oh wow look at this room this has the","ep021"
"10600",15,"high ceilings big bright rooms and a lot","ep021"
"10601",18,"of space for entertaining are high on","ep021"
"10602",21,"the list for these 26 year olds we're","ep021"
"10603",24,"looking forward to buying a home before","ep021"
"10604",27,"their upcoming wedding I'm just so ready","ep021"
"10605",30,"to finally move out of my pants but","ep021"
"10606",33,"flying the coop may have to wait since","ep021"
"10607",36,"these Long Islanders have very different","ep021"
"10608",39,"tastes and houses look at these walls","ep021"
"10609",42,"this is the rustic feature I was looking","ep021"
"10610",45,"for it looks old-fashioned it looks like","ep021"
"10611",48,"it needs to be redone if the wood walls","ep021"
"10612",51,"weren't here I would pay to put them in","ep021"
"10613",54,"this seems kind of small for a master","ep021"
"10614",57,"you can make it work with the a bed and","ep021"
"10615",60,"a dresser and that's all you need my","ep021"
"10616",63,"main concern is if I'm doing something","ep021"
"10617",66,"in the kitchen or we have friends over I","ep021"
"10618",69,"would be all by myself and someone","ep021"
"10619",72,"always get stuck in the kitchen","ep021"

"10628",99,"three and a half years ago how was it I","ep021"
"10629",102,"love Dan because he can be serious but","ep021"
"10630",105,"also total goofball","ep021"
"10631",108,"he loves his nieces and nephews so much","ep021"
"10632",111,"he's definitely obsessed with his horror","ep021"
"10633",114,"movies Emily is very outgoing she's very","ep021"
"10634",117,"friendly so he songs so much to figure","ep021"
"10635",120,"out for the wedding and now that they're","ep021"
"10636",123,"getting married they want to buy their","ep021"
"10637",126,"own house here in New York on Long","ep021"
"10638",129,"Island where both of them grew up Long","ep021"
"10639",132,"Island is a great place to live because","ep021"
"10640",135,"it's close to anything you would need or","ep021"
"10641",138,"want to do the beaches and the shops and","ep021"
"10642",141,"the malls you can travel to Manhattan","ep021"
"10643",144,"really easily from Long Island it's just","ep021"
"10644",147,"a quick train ride oh look at this one","ep021"
"10645",150,"we are currently living at Dan's parents","ep021"
"10646",153,"house it's been really awesome that his","ep021"
"10647",156,"parents have let us live with them but","ep021"
"10648",159,"we're definitely ready to move out we","ep021"
"10649",162,"didn't have to pay you rent that","ep021"
"10650",165,"definitely gave us a boost in helping us","ep021"
"10651",168,"buy our first home but still it'll be a","ep021"
"10652",171,"bit of a stretch since homes on Long","ep021"
"10653",174,"Island are pricey","ep021"
"10654",177,"yeah our budget is I believe 550 and I","ep021"
"10655",180,"don't think we're going a penny over we","ep021"
"10656",183,"definitely want to stay under that and","ep021"
"10657",186,"we I personally prefer to have the","ep021"
"10658",189,"budget closer to 500,000 if we do go","ep021"
"10659",192,"close to 550 it has to be completely","ep021"
"10660",195,"move-in ready with not much to do at all","ep021"
"10661",198,"this house looks gorgeous","ep021"
"10662",201,"nice-looking colonial I grew up in a","ep021"
"10663",204,"colonial I love the bedrooms are","ep021"
"10664",207,"upstairs it really separates the noise","ep021"
"10665",210,"when people are trying to rest I don't","ep021"
"10666",213,"know about all those stairs look at this","ep021"
"10667",216,"sign it's a ranch I'm interested in","ep021"
"10668",219,"looking for a ranch-style home I think","ep021"
"10669",222,"it's awesome when everything is on the","ep021"
"10670",225,"same floor and if you do want that","ep021"
"10671",228,"private space you could always go to the","ep021"
"10672",231,"basement Dan's on board with a basement","ep021"
"10673",234,"since he'd love his own personal game","ep021"
"10674",237,"room I would love to have a basement","ep021"
"10675",240,"with a man spa","ep021"
"10676",243,"where I can have my own pool table or","ep021"
"10677",246,"ping-pong table or all right that's a","ep021"
"10678",249,"place for me","ep021"
"10679",252,"Dan's also willing to consider homes","ep021"
"10680",255,"that may need some work well we don't","ep021"
"10681",258,"have any kids right now and I think this","ep021"
"10682",261,"would be a good time for us where we","ep021"
"10683",264,"could totally take our time put our","ep021"
"10684",267,"money into it and make it you don't know","ep021"
"10685",270,"how much money you're going to end up","ep021"
"10686",273,"putting into it you open up walls and","ep021"
"10687",276,"you find all problems you didn't know","ep021"
"10688",279,"we're there and we're going to use up","ep021"
"10689",282,"all of our savings I would love if my","ep021"
"10690",285,"house could have three beds and two full","ep021"
"10691",288,"baths but I definitely prefer a fourth","ep021"
"10692",291,"bedroom to get that fourth bedroom they","ep021"
"10693",294,"realize they may have to compromise on","ep021"
"10694",297,"location we probably prefer to find a","ep021"
"10695",300,"house in Nassau County because that's","ep021"
"10696",303,"closer to our jobs and our families but","ep021"
"10697",306,"we were open to more out east and","ep021"
"10698",309,"Suffolk County because you can get a","ep021"
"10699",312,"little bit more out there ooh","ep021"
"10700",315,"space looks nice and open and bright I","ep021"
"10701",318,"love that I definitely need an","ep021"
"10702",321,"open-concept floor plan with the kitchen","ep021"
"10703",324,"to the living space I would love some","ep021"
"10704",327,"special rustic elements like exposed","ep021"
"10705",330,"brick or exposed wood beams","ep021"
"10706",333,"I prefer tall white on the inside it","ep021"
"10707",336,"makes the house look more modern it's","ep021"
"10708",339,"just so white there's no color anywhere","ep021"
"10709",342,"I would definitely like a lot of warmer","ep021"
"10710",345,"color tones instead of a lot of white","ep021"
"10711",348,"I'm just so ready to finally move out of","ep021"

"10770",525,"really nice space upstairs they see two","ep021"
"10771",528,"secondary bedrooms this is a very tight","ep021"
"10772",531,"room you have opportunity in this house","ep021"
"10773",534,"because over the garage you have flat","ep021"
"10774",537,"space and you could extend this as well","ep021"
"10775",540,"as the last bedroom over the garage and","ep021"
"10776",543,"then you could also put another bathroom","ep021"
"10777",546,"here as well yeah that can definitely","ep021"
"10778",549,"help we can do the bump out make the","ep021"
"10779",552,"rooms a little bit bigger","ep021"
"10780",555,"while this home is listed at a good","ep021"
"10781",558,"price those things get very expensive I","ep021"
"10782",561,"really don't know if that would end up","ep021"
"10783",564,"staying in our budget nice room with a","ep021"
"10784",567,"lot of light coming into it as well yeah","ep021"
"10785",570,"there is a lot of natural light but this","ep021"
"10786",573,"seems kind of small for a master","ep021"
"10787",576,"you can make it work with the a bed and","ep021"
"10788",579,"a dresser do you that's all you need so","ep021"
"10789",582,"you have a full-size bed here oh that's","ep021"
"10790",585,"great I don't know it's like a master","ep021"
"10791",588,"bath this is the only full bath for the","ep021"
"10792",591,"three bedrooms on the right I think it'd","ep021"
"10793",594,"be okay let's check out the basement","ep021"
"10794",597,"guys oh this is a really nicely finished","ep021"
"10795",600,"basement yeah this would be a great spot","ep021"
"10796",603,"for my man space doesn't even feel like","ep021"
"10797",606,"a basement down here it feels like a","ep021"
"10798",609,"done","ep021"
"10799",612,"[Music]","ep021"
"10800",615,"what do you think of the home well it's","ep021"
"10801",618,"definitely not a ranch this house though","ep021"
"10802",621,"had that curb appeal with the brick and","ep021"
"10803",624,"the shutters and the porch you can't","ep021"
"10804",627,"beat the fact that it's located in","ep021"
"10805",630,"Nassau County right near our friends our","ep021"
"10806",633,"jobs our families yeah the house feels","ep021"
"10807",636,"very modern redone but it just feels","ep021"
"10808",639,"really boring inside the only rustic","ep021"
"10809",642,"element of this house is the brick on","ep021"
"10810",645,"the outside but I do love the fact that","ep021"
"10811",648,"it's colonial and like Peter said we","ep021"
"10812",651,"could extend the house over the garage","ep021"
"10813",654,"and he even suggested adding another","ep021"
"10814",657,"full bath but that could just go so","ep021"
"10815",660,"over-budget since Emily would prefer a","ep021"
"10816",663,"ranch their agents lined up one to show","ep021"
"10817",666,"them although Dan might be a tough sell","ep021"
"10818",669,"yeah but the house looks small from the","ep021"
"10819",672,"outside","ep021"
"10820",675,"[Music]","ep021"
"10821",678,"can I have an everything bagel with","ep021"
"10822",681,"scallion cream cheese please engaged","ep021"
"10823",684,"couple Dan and Emily have been living","ep021"
"10824",687,"with his parents to save money for a","ep021"
"10825",690,"home on Long Island we definitely need","ep021"
"10826",693,"to leave some room in our budget because","ep021"
"10827",696,"we have no furniture since we lived with","ep021"
"10828",699,"your parents","ep021"
"10829",702,"everything is theirs we don't have","ep021"
"10830",705,"anything with a max budget of five","ep021"
"10831",708,"hundred and fifty thousand dollars","ep021"
"10832",711,"they've seen a 3-bedroom colonial in","ep021"
"10833",714,"their prime location since it was under","ep021"
"10834",717,"budget","ep021"
"10835",720,"Dan's open to adding some square footage","ep021"
"10836",723,"over the garage but Emily's nervous","ep021"
"10837",726,"about taking on an expensive project and","ep021"
"10838",729,"style-wise she'd really prefer a rustic","ep021"
"10839",732,"ranch so now they're back in the same","ep021"
"10840",735,"prime area to see a property that may","ep021"
"10841",738,"appeal more to her this doesn't look","ep021"
"10842",741,"like in colonial yeah this one's our","ep021"
"10843",744,"ranch for me but look at the nice quiet","ep021"
"10844",747,"street yeah but the house looks small","ep021"
"10845",750,"from the outside obviously Peter was","ep021"
"10846",753,"thinking about Emily when he picked this","ep021"
"10847",756,"house this is nothing like a colonial","ep021"
"10848",759,"Dan's not even giving this ranch a","ep021"
"10849",762,"chance he's just all colonial colonial","ep021"
"10850",765,"colonial hey guys come on oh it looks a","ep021"
"10851",768,"lot bigger on the inside than from the","ep021"
"10852",771,"other side yeah so this is a beautiful","ep021"
"10853",774,"expanded ranch approximately 1430 square","ep021"
"10854",777,"feet","ep021"
"10855",780,"it has three bedrooms two baths priced","ep021"
"10856",783,"around 535 535 is towards the top of our","ep021"
"10857",786,"budget so it needs to be pretty close to","ep021"
"10858",789,"perfect right I understand","ep021"
"10859",792,"Long Island is a very desirable market","ep021"
"10860",795,"so the home prices reflect that I really","ep021"
"10861",798,"like these wood floors right when you","ep021"
"10862",801,"walk in it just makes the house feel","ep021"
"10863",804,"really warm and gives it a little bit of","ep021"
"10864",807,"a rustic vibe you have really really","ep021"
"10865",810,"pretty wood floors this is more of the","ep021"
"10866",813,"living room family room","ep021"
"10867",816,"I love the recessed lighting and I also","ep021"
"10868",819,"love the natural light as well yeah","ep021"
"10869",822,"these windows are beautiful oh wow look","ep021"
"10870",825,"at this room this has the high ceiling","ep021"
"10871",828,"yeah this is uh this is the great room","ep021"
"10872",831,"so I love this room this could be your","ep021"
"10873",834,"dining room it could be another den yeah","ep021"
"10874",837,"I love to like come look at all the","ep021"
"10875",840,"light there's so many windows then look","ep021"
"10876",843,"at these walls this is the rustic","ep021"
"10877",846,"feature I was looking for they're","ep021"
"10878",849,"gorgeous","ep021"
"10879",852,"I I don't really like them this looks","ep021"
"10880",855,"like there's holes that need to be","ep021"
"10881",858,"filled the holes give the house some","ep021"
"10882",861,"character it's so special I really","ep021"
"10883",864,"really love this I don't know why emily","ep021"
"10884",867,"is obsessed with these rustic walls I","ep021"
"10885",870,"think it looks old-fashioned it looks","ep021"
"10886",873,"like it needs to be redone dan is crazy","ep021"
"10887",876,"the rustic look of this house is so","ep021"
"10888",879,"great if the wood walls weren't here I","ep021"
"10889",882,"would pay to put them in let's take a","ep021"
"10890",885,"look at the backyard oh it looks like a","ep021"
"10891",888,"good-size yard under all the snow you","ep021"
"10892",891,"have a beautiful deck oh that's awesome","ep021"
"10893",894,"yeah especially during the summer when","ep021"
"10894",897,"we have barbecues or something I don't","ep021"
"10895",900,"know about the hot tub I think it's a","ep021"
"10896",903,"great future I know we didn't want a","ep021"
"10897",906,"pool because of the cost of maintenance","ep021"
"10898",909,"I think a pool is a different story a","ep021"
"10899",912,"pool is definitely a deal breaker for me","ep021"
"10900",915,"but I think the hot tub is a great","ep021"
"10901",918,"addition that I never thought of I think","ep021"
"10902",921,"it's easy maintenance and it would be","ep021"
"10903",924,"great for us oh wow this kitchen is","ep021"
"10904",927,"really nice yeah it's a nice boat","ep021"
"10905",930,"outside I love the stainless steel","ep021"
"10906",933,"appliances and this granite countertop","ep021"
"10907",936,"is huge I'm not sure like the old-school","ep021"
"10908",939,"look of cabinets know anyone like oh","ep021"
"10909",942,"they just have like that vintage rustic","ep021"
"10910",945,"feel they're supposed to be a little off","ep021"
"10911",948,"ways I don't know how I feel about that","ep021"
"10912",951,"the most important thing for us is that","ep021"
"10913",954,"this kitchen is so open-concept I could","ep021"
"10914",957,"still see into this space here","ep021"
"10915",960,"and even though I'm small it definitely","ep021"
"10916",963,"feels bigger so here you have the first","ep021"
"10917",966,"guest room that feels extremely small I","ep021"
"10918",969,"grew up in a small bedroom and you could","ep021"
"10919",972,"definitely fit a twin size bed over","ep021"
"10920",975,"there and there's enough room for a","ep021"
"10921",978,"dresser Oh easily yes so that's all you","ep021"
"10922",981,"need a good size closet as well they see","ep021"
"10923",984,"another secondary bedroom then head to","ep021"
"10924",987,"the guest bath oh this is nice","ep021"
"10925",990,"I really like that there's a nice tub","ep021"
"10926",993,"here because that's great down the line","ep021"
"10927",996,"for kids let's check out the master","ep021"
"10928",999,"bedroom","ep021"
"10929",1002,"sure also a really good-size room we","ep021"
"10930",1005,"could definitely fit a king bed in here","ep021"
"10931",1008,"what also is nice about is that the","ep021"
"10932",1011,"master has an ensuite oh this is great","ep021"
"10933",1014,"having two full bathrooms in the house","ep021"
"10934",1017,"yeah this is beautiful this must have","ep021"
"10935",1020,"been recently redone also I love the","ep021"
"10936",1023,"stone it feels a little tight but at","ep021"
"10937",1026,"least we'd have a mess","ep021"
"10938",1029,"banter they head downstairs to the","ep021"
"10939",1032,"finished basement oh wow this is a great","ep021"
"10940",1035,"space you have a bar which is a nice wet","ep021"
"10941",1038,"bar and then if you look around you have","ep021"
"10942",1041,"plenty of space to put like a foosball","ep021"
"10943",1044,"table air hockey ping-pong table put a","ep021"
"10944",1047,"nice TV set here there's plenty options","ep021"
"10945",1050,"just still needs a lot of work though","ep021"
"10946",1053,"this would definitely add to our budget","ep021"
"10947",1056,"so what do you think about the home I","ep021"
"10948",1059,"love it it has that open concept it has","ep021"
"10949",1062,"so much natural light I love that it's a","ep021"
"10950",1065,"ranch and it really has that special","ep021"
"10951",1068,"rustic look that I was looking for I do","ep021"
"10952",1071,"like the vaulted ceilings I think the","ep021"
"10953",1074,"master suite is definitely a plus I","ep021"
"10954",1077,"don't like the fact that it's not a","ep021"
"10955",1080,"colonial I really don't like the","ep021"
"10956",1083,"cabinetry I think it's a little too","ep021"
"10957",1086,"rustic for me and it has three bedrooms","ep021"
"10958",1089,"even though I prefer four all right","ep021"
"10959",1092,"let's go see some more homes since a","ep021"
"10960",1095,"4-bedroom home would be their ideal","ep021"

"11031",1308,"of landscaping I don't know how much","ep021"
"11032",1311,"that would cost you could get someone to","ep021"

"11034",1317,"your own you can plant bushes that","ep021"

"11037",1326,"check out the master bedroom","ep021"
"11038",1329,"with an ensuite lots of space and loo","ep021"

"11045",1350,"open on one floor Emily doesn't","ep021"
"11046",1353,"understand the benefits of the colonial","ep021"
"11047",1356,"I think it's great having the two floors","ep021"
"11048",1359,"separate it's not all cluttered and","ep021"
"11049",1362,"claustrophobic on the first floor where","ep021"
"11050",1365,"everything's in one section so here you","ep021"
"11051",1368,"have a really gorgeous full bath with a","ep021"
"11052",1371,"tub tile up to the ceiling yeah I think","ep021"
"11053",1374,"it was done really nicely it's just very","ep021"
"11054",1377,"simple the colors are neutral and this","ep021"
"11055",1380,"double vanity looks very nice what's","ep021"
"11056",1383,"really cool about this is called a","ep021"
"11057",1386,"jack-and-jill bathroom so it comes in","ep021"
"11058",1389,"here and then it leads into the next","ep021"
"11059",1392,"bedroom okay you have the gorgeous","ep021"
"11060",1395,"hardwood floors in here and lots and","ep021"
"11061",1398,"lots of space I mean you could easily","ep021"
"11062",1401,"fit you know queen and king sized bed in","ep021"
"11063",1404,"these rooms yeah this is a nice good","ep021"
"11064",1407,"size space they see two more secondary","ep021"
"11065",1410,"bedrooms that's a huge bonus that this","ep021"
"11066",1413,"house has a fourth bedroom two flights","ep021"
"11067",1416,"down is the basement you have some","ep021"
"11068",1419,"really good space down here we can make","ep021"
"11069",1422,"it a nice man space or a gym definitely","ep021"
"11070",1425,"some work to do but I think we can do","ep021"
"11071",1428,"that over time and put our own imprint","ep021"
"11072",1431,"on it","ep021"
"11073",1434,"so when you think of the home guys I","ep021"
"11074",1437,"love the fact that its colonial I think","ep021"
"11075",1440,"it's big bedrooms upstairs and it does","ep021"
"11076",1443,"have that fourth bedroom and the","ep021"
"11077",1446,"backyard is beautiful and also the whole","ep021"
"11078",1449,"basement downstairs but they both need a","ep021"
"11079",1452,"lot of work it doesn't have that","ep021"
"11080",1455,"open-concept look that I was really","ep021"
"11081",1458,"looking for whoever's in the kitchen is","ep021"
"11082",1461,"kind of on their own it's a lot to","ep021"
"11083",1464,"consider","ep021"
"11084",1467,"so Emily and Dan will have to choose","ep021"
"11085",1470,"what's most important a finished","ep021"
"11086",1473,"basement a master suite or nabbing that","ep021"
"11087",1476,"fourth bedroom so we need to make a","ep021"
"11088",1479,"decision we're here for our wedding cake","ep021"
"11089",1482,"tasting engaged couple Emily and Dan","ep021"
"11090",1485,"have a budget of five hundred and fifty","ep021"
"11091",1488,"thousand dollars to buy their first home","ep021"
"11092",1491,"on Long Island after seeing several","ep021"
"11093",1494,"options it's time to choose","ep021"
"11094",1497,"so what do you think about the brick","ep021"
"11095",1500,"colonial at 469 I love the fact that it","ep021"
"11096",1503,"was a colonial with two stories yeah I","ep021"
"11097",1506,"love the look of the outside but it","ep021"
"11098",1509,"didn't really have much of a rustic feel","ep021"
"11099",1512,"on the inside and the bathroom upstairs","ep021"
"11100",1515,"was this one bathroom before three rooms","ep021"
"11101",1518,"I liked Peters idea of being able to","ep021"
"11102",1521,"bump it out over the garage but a home","ep021"
"11103",1524,"is already pretty expensive so projects","ep021"
"11104",1527,"like that can really add up but it's","ep021"
"11105",1530,"very convenient for our work and our","ep021"
"11106",1533,"friends and family and on the other home","ep021"
"11107",1536,"that was really close to everything is","ep021"
"11108",1539,"the ranch priced at 5:35 you walk in and","ep021"
"11109",1542,"it feels open right away there's the","ep021"
"11110",1545,"nice entryway I love the color of the","ep021"
"11111",1548,"wood floors the curb appeal was","ep021"
"11112",1551,"definitely not there for me and also the","ep021"
"11113",1554,"bedrooms were not as big as I expected","ep021"
"11114",1557,"but at least the master had that ensuite","ep021"
"11115",1560,"which is something we never thought we","ep021"
"11116",1563,"would have","ep021"
"11117",1566,"I like the big basement yeah I think","ep021"
"11118",1569,"that basement has a lot of potential I","ep021"
"11119",1572,"also love that the home had that rustic","ep021"
"11120",1575,"feel inside with those wood walls I","ep021"
"11121",1578,"really do wish it had that fourth","ep021"
"11122",1581,"bedroom and that gray colonial it was","ep021"
"11123",1584,"priced just 429 when I first walked up","ep021"
"11124",1587,"to it I heard it's how how many stairs","ep021"
"11125",1590,"were in that house yeah but I love the","ep021"
"11126",1593,"look of the house from the outside I did","ep021"
"11127",1596,"not like the colors in that kitchen but","ep021"
"11128",1599,"and forth broom with a master bathroom","ep021"
"11129",1602,"and all the bedrooms were big not just","ep021"
"11130",1605,"the master but it's so far away so we","ep021"
"11131",1608,"need to make a decision I think I know","ep021"
"11132",1611,"which one I want to eliminate first","ep021"
"11133",1614,"though gray colonial while it was a","ep021"
"11134",1617,"gorgeous giant home I just wouldn't be","ep021"
"11135",1620,"able to live with that busy street and I","ep021"
"11136",1623,"just think the distance is too much yeah","ep021"
"11137",1626,"that's true","ep021"
"11138",1629,"I love the curb appeal of brick colonial","ep021"
"11139",1632,"but the range just has the extra","ep021"
"11140",1635,"bathroom which we're gonna need down the","ep021"
"11141",1638,"road so I think that maybe even one that","ep021"
"11142",1641,"we'll have to go with it's a great home","ep021"
"11143",1644,"for us somewhere we can really grow into","ep021"
"11144",1647,"let's get Peter a call all right it has","ep021"
"11145",1650,"been two months since we bought the","ep021"
"11146",1653,"house and we moved in about a month ago","ep021"
"11147",1656,"it's convenient for it work for both of","ep021"
"11148",1659,"us and it's close to our family and","ep021"
"11149",1662,"friends the house was listed at 535,000","ep021"
"11150",1665,"and we paid 525 for it my favorite space","ep021"
"11151",1668,"in the house is the living room I think","ep021"
"11152",1671,"it's a great entertainment area","ep021"
"11153",1674,"definitely my favorite we haven't had to","ep021"
"11154",1677,"do a lot of house projects because the","ep021"
"11155",1680,"home was basically move-in-ready but we","ep021"
"11156",1683,"were basically starting from scratch in","ep021"
"11157",1686,"terms of furniture tables is amazing I","ep021"
"11158",1689,"want to use the basement as a man space","ep021"
"11159",1692,"set up a nice couch there with a nice TV","ep021"
"11160",1695,"we made the kitchen open to a small","ep021"
"11161",1698,"couch and a table and we use it for","ep021"
"11162",1701,"having friends gather around the","ep021"
"11163",1704,"peninsula one of my main compromises was","ep021"
"11164",1707,"that it didn't have the fourth bedroom","ep021"
"11165",1710,"but for now it's working out just fine","ep021"
"11166",1713,"since it's just the two of us and we'll","ep021"
"11167",1716,"figure that out down the road well this","ep021"
"11168",1719,"house definitely is not a colonial which","ep021"
"11169",1722,"is what I was looking for turns out I","ep021"
"11170",1725,"really have no regrets the ranch is","ep021"
"11171",1728,"really growing on me it's definitely","ep021"
"11172",1731,"exciting being homeowners for the first","ep021"

"11528",1062,"garage so now their brokers come through","ep022"
"11529",1065,"on the garage well it's not traditional","ep022"

"11532",1074,"it does have that I'm excited about that","ep022"

"11534",1080,"you can see where the first floor comes","ep022"
"11535",1083,"out and I see the stairs up to landing","ep022"

"11553",1137,"about the split for you but it is an","ep022"
"11554",1140,"option that they're gonna have to","ep022"
"11555",1143,"consider because of the fact that the","ep022"
"11556",1146,"homes are selling really really fast","ep022"

"12484",546,"more than what our budget is it's just","ep024"
"12485",549,"everything I dreamed about when we moved","ep024"
"12486",552,"here I'm gonna spend that much money","ep024"
"12487",555,"then this is not what I had in mind for","ep024"
"12488",558,"being able to let the dogs out and just","ep024"
"12489",561,"run around the yard I get the concept of","ep024"
"12490",564,"a budget I just you know we want to","ep024"

"12495",579,"fix something so that it will be","ep024"
"12496",582,"acceptable to Joel this is in the middle","ep024"
"12497",585,"of nowhere how far away is downtown","ep024"
"12498",588,"Hanyang it's about 30 40 minutes","ep024"

"12503",603,"different units here which house is it","ep024"
"12504",606,"both of them belong to you it's the","ep024"
"12505",609,"entire property but it's $1,500 a month","ep024"
"12506",612,"that's right on budget that's great well","ep024"
"12507",615,"I guess we have to see it so this is the","ep024"
"12508",618,"first floor this is very nice he's very","ep024"
"12509",621,"open very spacious but this kitchen is","ep024"
"12510",624,"interesting have you ever seen a wooden","ep024"
"12511",627,"countertop before it just doesn't make","ep024"
"12512",630,"sense it's all the cooking that I do I","ep024"
"12513",633,"mean is this even an appropriate cook","ep024"
"12514",636,"surface this is what you're gonna find","ep024"
"12515",639,"Ewing grease it has a dishwasher a","ep024"
"12516",642,"microwave and a coffee pot you're really","ep024"
"12517",645,"trying to sell this place on me aren't","ep024"
"12518",648,"you oh my goodness anything with","ep024"
"12519",651,"extremely remote dole would be all about","ep024"
"12520",654,"so this is the master bedroom plane but","ep024"
"12521",657,"it's a pretty good space yeah is there","ep024"
"12522",660,"not a nun suite no unfortunately there's","ep024"
"12523",663,"a separate bathroom well it's not an","ep024"
"12524",666,"ensuite but I'll take it","ep024"
"12525",669,"this house does have a lot of space","ep024"
"12526",672,"maybe she can just get used to crossing","ep024"
"12527",675,"the hallway to go to the bathroom","ep024"
"12528",678,"and this is the second tool it's genius","ep024"
"12529",681,"exactly the same same wooden countertop","ep024"
"12530",684,"same layout","ep024"
"12531",687,"check out the ceilings I mean this is","ep024"
"12532",690,"different than downstairs yeah that is","ep024"
"12533",693,"true","ep024"
"12534",696,"this gives it a lot of character and","ep024"
"12535",699,"even more space that's a lot to maintain","ep024"
"12536",702,"and you know do we need that repetition","ep024"
"12537",705,"so that was kind of odd","ep024"
"12538",708,"check out that view over there oh my","ep024"
"12539",711,"gosh we've got the Sun rising over","ep024"
"12540",714,"Zorba's Mountain you've got the Sun","ep024"
"12541",717,"setting over the Mediterranean I would","ep024"
"12542",720,"definitely prefer hearing the waves","ep024"
"12543",723,"crashing on the beach to the traffic","ep024"
"12544",726,"noise coming off the road I know but it","ep024"
"12545",729,"might be a small price to pay for that","ep024"
"12546",732,"downtown Hanyu spot joel is definitely","ep024"
"12547",735,"more of a country boy and I'm more of","ep024"
"12548",738,"the city gal so it wasn't what I had in","ep024"
"12549",741,"mind the layout this home is different","ep024"
"12550",744,"you know I'm not used to seeing a bottom","ep024"
"12551",747,"floor natok sword with the same floor","ep024"
"12552",750,"plan but I love it I love the yard I","ep024"
"12553",753,"love the space and I love that it's","ep024"
"12554",756,"right at our budget it has a garage I","ep024"
"12555",759,"can definitely picture us living here","ep024"
"12556",762,"this house has so many things on his","ep024"
"12557",765,"checklist that he's more than happy to","ep024"
"12558",768,"settle but I had a heart set on living","ep024"
"12559",771,"in downtown Hanyu and it was like deja","ep024"
"12560",774,"vu we're on the second floor which was","ep024"
"12561",777,"still kind of weird to me but I just","ep024"
"12562",780,"wanted to show you how much more you","ep024"
"12563",783,"could get for your money if you oughta","ep024"
"12564",786,"listen to her","ep024"
"12565",789,"yes this is beautiful Jeanie Joel and","ep024"
"12566",792,"Kirsten are now more confused than ever","ep024"
"12567",795,"it has just about everything that we","ep024"
"12568",798,"need about which direction they should","ep024"
"12569",801,"go it's just a little bit small and we","ep024"
"12570",804,"can't walk to downtown Hanyu I don't","ep024"
"12571",807,"know what we're gonna do is difficult","ep024"
"12572",810,"decision Thurston's adventurous spirit","ep024"
"12573",813,"was ready for a new experience so she","ep024"
"12574",816,"persuaded Joel to leave Japan for her","ep024"
"12575",819,"job in Chania Greece moving from Japan","ep024"
"12576",822,"we have to it just not only to want me","ep024"
"12577",825,"to a new job and to just a new culture I","ep024"
"12578",828,"also don't have a job yet so this is","ep024"
"12579",831,"gonna be so incredibly different my","ep024"
"12580",834,"career is at stake I feel like I'm in","ep024"
"12581",837,"the prime of my working life and so","ep024"
"12582",840,"giving up something that I've been doing","ep024"
"12583",843,"for five years - not knowing what I'm","ep024"
"12584",846,"gonna be doing is kind of a scary","ep024"
"12585",849,"feeling I'm a natural optimist and I","ep024"
"12586",852,"have a lot of dreams and hopes and I'm","ep024"
"12587",855,"more excited about making drastic","ep024"
"12588",858,"decisions I think that's just more in my","ep024"
"12589",861,"nature I'm a bit more of a pros and cons","ep024"
"12590",864,"person but there's a lot of things that","ep024"
"12591",867,"I probably wouldn't do if she wasn't","ep024"
"12592",870,"there to kind of pull me along and say","ep024"
"12593",873,"this is a great opportunity let's do","ep024"
"12594",876,"this","ep024"
"12595",879,"Joel's willing to expand his comfort","ep024"
"12596",882,"zone to give Kirsten an immersive Greek","ep024"
"12597",885,"experience this is the location I was","ep024"
"12598",888,"imagining but he has needs as well how","ep024"
"12599",891,"much does it cost per month its 1800 -","ep024"
"12600",894,"yeah that's definitely over our budget","ep024"
"12601",897,"it was important to me that while I look","ep024"
"12602",900,"for jobs I find a house that has the","ep024"
"12603",903,"things that are important to me like a","ep024"
"12604",906,"place that I can brew my beer and is","ep024"
"12605",909,"more quiet this is in the middle of","ep024"
"12606",912,"nowhere","ep024"
"12607",915,"I would definitely prefer hearing the","ep024"
"12608",918,"waves crashing on the beach - the","ep024"
"12609",921,"traffic noise coming off the road which","ep024"
"12610",924,"unit visit they both fuels having two","ep024"
"12611",927,"apartments that just feels kind of odd","ep024"
"12612",930,"to me that's a lot to maintain and you","ep024"
"12613",933,"know do we need that repetition there it","ep024"
"12614",936,"has a dishwasher a microwave and a","ep024"
"12615",939,"coffee pot you're really trying to sell","ep024"

"12619",951,"you're only in Chania once it's quite","ep024"
"12620",954,"challenging trying to find a home that","ep024"
"12621",957,"they both like so we've got to try and","ep024"
"12622",960,"get something that's gonna fit their","ep024"
"12623",963,"budget and somewhere where they'll both","ep024"
"12624",966,"be able to compromise this property that","ep024"
"12625",969,"I'm going to show you now is in a very","ep024"
"12626",972,"quiet neighborhood this is a great","ep024"
"12627",975,"property for the dogs yeah it has a nice","ep024"
"12628",978,"big yard over there but looks a bit like","ep024"
"12629",981,"a vacation home this is a three bedroom","ep024"
"12630",984,"apartment two bathrooms","ep024"
"12631",987,"it's got swimming pool that sounds","ep024"
"12632",990,"fantastic","ep024"
"12633",993,"just so that you do know it's a communal","ep024"
"12634",996,"area so we share it with the other yes","ep024"
"12635",999,"okay but it really is quiet out here","ep024"
"12636",1002,"but how close is this place to Downtown","ep024"
"12637",1005,"Hanyu it's about 15 minutes on these","ep024"
"12638",1008,"roads it's not really walkable yeah but","ep024"
"12639",1011,"we can drive into the city anytime we","ep024"
"12640",1014,"want to but does the house come with a","ep024"
"12641",1017,"garage unfortunately not","ep024"

"12650",1044,"up and make it our own don't know how","ep024"
"12651",1047,"homey it feels like I think I have to","ep024"

"12675",1119,"able to store all my tools and equipment","ep024"
"12676",1122,"and the other thing we can't walk to","ep024"

"12681",1137,"you're gonna put all your stuff the calm","ep024"
"12682",1140,"country or the busy city choosing","ep024"

"12684",1146,"personality","ep024"
"12685",1149,"when out in the end I think my vote","ep024"
"12686",1152,"should count for something I'll","ep024"
"12687",1155,"definitely make sure joel has a voice I","ep024"
"12688",1158,"just want to make sure he hears mine too","ep024"

"12700",1194,"like we can drive to the city deciding","ep024"
"12701",1197,"between the quiet country or the vibrant","ep024"
"12702",1200,"city of Chania isn't going to be easy","ep024"
"12703",1203,"Kirsten feels living centrally is the","ep024"
"12704",1206,"best way to experience Greek culture and","ep024"
"12705",1209,"house ones only a short stroll away the","ep024"
"12706",1212,"downtown property clearly I love the","ep024"
"12707",1215,"location but it was $300 over budget and","ep024"
"12708",1218,"the road noise was just so loud you can","ep024"
"12709",1221,"hear it outside and even inside the","ep024"
"12710",1224,"house too","ep024"
"12711",1227,"it's just everything I dream about when","ep024"
"12712",1230,"we moved here and one of the sacrifices","ep024"
"12713",1233,"for being close to the center is you're","ep024"
"12714",1236,"gonna have road though it's cool he used","ep024"
"12715",1239,"to it joel plans to pass the time until","ep024"
"12716",1242,"he finds work by watching their dogs and","ep024"
"12717",1245,"home brewing beer and house two gives","ep024"
"12718",1248,"him plenty of room to do both the twin","ep024"
"12719",1251,"level house it had a lot of things that","ep024"
"12720",1254,"i was looking for and it was right on","ep024"
"12721",1257,"budget downfall 30 to 40 minute drive","ep024"
"12722",1260,"into the city center","ep024"
"12723",1263,"and don't you take the layouts weird","ep024"
"12724",1266,"well Damien is exactly the same is below","ep024"
"12725",1269,"for sure that's a lot to maintain and do","ep024"
"12726",1272,"we need that repetition their house 3 is","ep024"
"12727",1275,"the only option that helps them find at","ep024"
"12728",1278,"least some common ground I mean that","ep024"
"12729",1281,"view was amazing","ep024"
"12730",1284,"it pull is gorgeous oh yes oh yes this","ep024"
"12731",1287,"is beautiful Jeanne it's just a little","ep024"
"12732",1290,"bit small on the inside and I'm not","ep024"
"12733",1293,"really sure where we're gonna be able to","ep024"
"12734",1296,"store all my tools and equipment and we","ep024"
"12735",1299,"can't walk to downtown Hanyu hat but is","ep024"
"12736",1302,"something that we're gonna really have","ep024"
"12737",1305,"to consider","ep024"
"12738",1308,"[Music]","ep024"
"12739",1311,"so we can narrow down the field let's","ep024"
"12740",1314,"eliminate the pool apartment yeah I","ep024"
"12741",1317,"agree","ep024"
"12742",1320,"no garage to put your stuff and it still","ep024"
"12743",1323,"was pretty far outside the city yeah","ep024"
"12744",1326,"[Music]","ep024"
"12745",1329,"that's downtown property it's the","ep024"
"12746",1332,"location that we had in mind you know","ep024"
"12747",1335,"it's walking distance to all the shops","ep024"
"12748",1338,"and the restaurants and the culture and","ep024"
"12749",1341,"the size and the history of that house","ep024"
"12750",1344,"was just all I could ever want I know","ep024"
"12751",1347,"but it's $1,800 a month that's a small","ep024"
"12752",1350,"price to pay in the grand scheme of","ep024"
"12753",1353,"things to have that Greek experience but","ep024"
"12754",1356,"I really just can't picture myself","ep024"
"12755",1359,"sitting on that patio that traffic and","ep024"
"12756",1362,"road noise was really loud the twin","ep024"
"12757",1365,"level house has so much to offer I'm","ep024"
"12758",1368,"concerned because a 30 to 40 minute","ep024"
"12759",1371,"drive away from downtown Hanyu really","ep024"
"12760",1374,"felt like it was in the middle of","ep024"
"12761",1377,"nowhere but it's really peaceful and","ep024"
"12762",1380,"quiet and it's right on budget having","ep024"
"12763",1383,"two levels that were exactly the same","ep024"
"12764",1386,"two kitchens two wooden countertops that","ep024"
"12765",1389,"was weird I don't know if I need all","ep024"
"12766",1392,"that yeah I can understand how you feel","ep024"
"12767",1395,"that but it has a garage a great yard","ep024"
"12768",1398,"and it has that view I'm gonna be","ep024"
"12769",1401,"spending a lot of time at home with the","ep024"
"12770",1404,"dogs and I can just see myself sitting","ep024"
"12771",1407,"up on the patio and looking down and","ep024"
"12772",1410,"watching the dogs running around in that","ep024"
"12773",1413,"fenced-in yard I definitely can't deny","ep024"

"12850",123,"to your apartment and I was like I I","ep025"
"12851",126,"haven't ruled out the years Eureka you","ep025"
"12852",129,"are so good at this it is very annoying","ep025"
"12853",132,"things like it's practical and so as I","ep025"

"12855",138,"everything with Keaton is very practical","ep025"
"12856",141,"so if it makes sense and is convenient","ep025"
"12857",144,"that's that's what he thinks is like the","ep025"
"12858",147,"way to go","ep025"
"12859",150,"it's I'm really up here I know I really","ep025"
"12860",153,"like it's part of the city I love I feel","ep025"
"12861",156,"that Pittsburgh is the best city in the","ep025"
"12862",159,"world but one of the first conversations","ep025"
"12863",162,"we had Canton said to me he said you","ep025"
"12864",165,"realized history not really the best","ep025"
"12865",168,"city in the world right and I was like","ep025"
"12866",171,"no i think everyone from pittsburgh will","ep025"
"12867",174,"tell you it is very the best city in the","ep025"
"12868",177,"world if you have a ton of the city","ep025"
"12869",180,"pride and it all stems from the sports","ep025"
"12870",183,"teams it's perhaps home for us too I","ep025"
"12871",186,"mean we both grew up about an hour","ep025"
"12872",189,"outside of the city a great place to","ep025"
"12873",192,"start a family so they've decided to buy","ep025"
"12874",195,"their first home here and have set their","ep025"
"12875",198,"budget at $600,000 mmediately then","ep025"
"12876",201,"obviously we have some different","ep025"
"12877",204,"architectural styles that we're working","ep025"
"12878",207,"through Kane is looking for shiny new","ep025"
"12879",210,"and really what I'm looking for is is","ep025"
"12880",213,"the fairy tale when I walk in the house","ep025"
"12881",216,"it has to have the right feel to me and","ep025"
"12882",219,"Maria gets that feeling from homes that","ep025"
"12883",222,"are close to a hundred years old I'm a","ep025"
"12884",225,"big bookworm and I see a house as a","ep025"
"12885",228,"setting for your story a thing I like","ep025"
"12886",231,"about old houses is that I feel that it","ep025"
"12887",234,"gives you a connection to the past and","ep025"
"12888",237,"you get to sort of share in someone","ep025"
"12889",240,"else's story and see how they live my","ep025"
"12890",243,"dream home is the whole Victorian","ep025"
"12891",246,"wraparound porch with the lattice","ep025"
"12892",249,"woodwork","ep025"
"12893",252,"she also likes the character of","ep025"
"12894",255,"tudor-style house they went too far with","ep025"
"12895",258,"the wood on this one oh that's original","ep025"
"12896",261,"hardwood I liked being to be newer newer","ep025"
"12897",264,"is always better I don't want to be in","ep025"
"12898",267,"someone else's history I want to start","ep025"
"12899",270,"my own I can't imagine myself buying","ep025"
"12900",273,"fixer-upper to fix up and in that sense","ep025"
"12901",276,"I'm thinking something modern what Kane","ep025"
"12902",279,"is looking for is something that used to","ep025"
"12903",282,"be a warehouse or a garage or some other","ep025"
"12904",285,"industrial place concrete floors with","ep025"
"12905",288,"just tech everywhere you I just can't do","ep025"
"12906",291,"it like no no I don't want to live in a","ep025"
"12907",294,"garage I just don't want to live in a","ep025"
"12908",297,"garage that is an unfair","ep025"
"12909",300,"characterization I want clean blinds I","ep025"
"12910",303,"don't want things to be cluttered I want","ep025"
"12911",306,"a house that's preserve the integrity","ep025"
"12912",309,"of the history and the time period","ep025"
"12913",312,"original hardwood I love the idea of","ep025"
"12914",315,"pocket doors big grand staircase","ep025"
"12915",318,"fireplace is a must and a closet bathtub","ep025"
"12916",321,"would be above and beyond my","ep025"
"12917",324,"expectations it doesn't have a small","ep025"
"12918",327,"partition rooms make the house feel","ep025"
"12919",330,"smaller I think people have this idea","ep025"
"12920",333,"that it makes it feel cozy people in the","ep025"
"12921",336,"kitchen need to be able to talk to","ep025"
"12922",339,"people in living room and everything he","ep025"
"12923",342,"said I just feel like back to the acid","ep025"
"12924",345,"about it I like the smaller rooms","ep025"
"12925",348,"good-looking bitchin nice kitchen an","ep025"
"12926",351,"updated kitchen is important for me I","ep025"
"12927",354,"spend a lot of time in the kitchen I","ep025"
"12928",357,"really enjoy cooking I would like","ep025"
"12929",360,"something with nice appliances I love","ep025"
"12930",363,"the idea of a breakfast bar jatin does","ep025"
"12931",366,"spend a lot of time in the kitchen","ep025"
"12932",369,"keeping me company","ep025"
"12933",372,"whenever I'm cooking this bedroom either","ep025"
"12934",375,"we absolutely mean ensuite bathroom in","ep025"
"12935",378,"the master bedroom it's just a much more","ep025"
"12936",381,"convenient especially if you have guests","ep025"
"12937",384,"over to have come so what I think about","ep025"
"12938",387,"your books are that there's always this","ep025"
"12939",390,"office a library for Maria's books and a","ep025"
"12940",393,"spacious backyard for entertaining round","ep025"
"12941",396,"out their list I do believe there is a","ep025"
"12942",399,"happy medium between what she's looking","ep025"
"12943",402,"for and without looking for okay","ep025"
"12944",405,"just like the setting to a Stephen King","ep025"
"12945",408,"novel more like a fairytale","ep025"
"12946",411,"I brought Caden and Maria to this","ep025"
"12947",414,"property specifically because it's a","ep025"
"12948",417,"Victorian home the character and the","ep025"
"12949",420,"charm throughout there's preserved","ep025"
"12950",423,"history in the home so this is more up","ep025"
"12951",426,"Maria's alley seller is asking 540 mm","ep025"
"12952",429,"budget yeah the coolest part is that","ep025"
"12953",432,"it's built in 1896 so I really think you","ep025"
"12954",435,"like that old teacher 119 years old I","ep025"
"12955",438,"know isn't it wonderful bunch of this","ep025"
"12956",441,"house was gonna range but with an older","ep025"
"12957",444,"house like this I know there's gonna be","ep025"
"12958",447,"a lot of renovations anyway a lot of","ep025"
"12959",450,"money that we probably don't want to","ep025"
"12960",453,"spend and love that stained glass that","ep025"
"12961",456,"is absolutely gorgeous this is a very","ep025"
"12962",459,"impressive entryway I will say that yeah","ep025"
"12963",462,"this is fantastic with all the original","ep025"
"12964",465,"woodwork can't get that and you nearly","ep025"
"12965",468,"built home oh and look at this fireplace","ep025"
"12966",471,"that is so neat there's actually six","ep025"
"12967",474,"original fireplaces throughout the home","ep025"
"12968",477,"that's awesome focal point want to walk","ep025"
"12969",480,"them right into the family room love","ep025"
"12970",483,"this detail on the ceiling notice so","ep025"
"12971",486,"needed this house is gonna be drafty and","ep025"
"12972",489,"then if you have a window this size it's","ep025"
"12973",492,"me really expensive to keep and cool","ep025"
"12974",495,"with insulation that's bad","ep025"
"12975",498,"well I mean we can upgrade that and we","ep025"
"12976",501,"find in it so we flow into the next room","ep025"
"12977",504,"the beautiful pocket doors it are","ep025"
"12978",507,"gorgeous I love the anything yeah with","ep025"
"12979",510,"those doors in the big entryway is they","ep025"
"12980",513,"it feels very open","ep025"
"12981",516,"it feels very open new your situation is","ep025"
"12982",519,"more when you're in the kitchen I'm in","ep025"
"12983",522,"here I won't be able to talk to you","ep025"
"12984",525,"while you're cooking yeah these light","ep025"

"12986",531,"you can't get them anywhere else just","ep025"
"12987",534,"doesn't look good and that's a matter of","ep025"
"12988",537,"opinion honey I love this house because","ep025"
"12989",540,"it really takes me back to the time","ep025"
"12990",543,"period I think when she looks at this","ep025"
"12991",546,"house all he sees is old and he's","ep025"
"12992",549,"missing a lot of the character a lot of","ep025"
"12993",552,"the things you can't get in a newly","ep025"
"12994",555,"built house what do you think I don't","ep025"
"12995",558,"like it","ep025"
"12996",561,"this I don't even know I actually kind","ep025"
"12997",564,"of like this dome I think it's kind of","ep025"
"12998",567,"neat it's gonna be energy inefficient","ep025"
"12999",570,"it's clearly old I mean my biggest","ep025"
"13000",573,"problem with this kitchen is there's","ep025"
"13001",576,"just no storage or counter space","ep025"
"13002",579,"we'd have to totally got it they step","ep025"
"13003",582,"outside to see the yard it's a really","ep025"
"13004",585,"nice backyard space it's pretty private","ep025"
"13005",588,"yeah it's even being up so like play a","ep025"
"13006",591,"game of catch yeah you are planning","ep025"
"13007",594,"garden","ep025"

"13009",600,"see the bedrooms this is a very nice","ep025"
"13010",603,"room oh it's so beautiful this would be","ep025"
"13011",606,"a great library space it would be they","ep025"
"13012",609,"see another bedroom before looking at","ep025"
"13013",612,"the master yeah and it doesn't have an","ep025"
"13014",615,"attached bathroom which is that's like a","ep025"
"13015",618,"huge bummer there's a beautiful bathroom","ep025"
"13016",621,"down the hallway oh wow this is really","ep025"
"13017",624,"small it is and I love the clawfoot tub","ep025"
"13018",627,"it's absolutely beautiful but there's no","ep025"
"13019",630,"shower what I'm trying to get ready in","ep025"
"13020",633,"the morning it's gotta be a shower","ep025"
"13021",636,"yeah they look at one more bedroom","ep025"
"13022",639,"before heading to the third floor which","ep025"
"13023",642,"has been converted into an in-law suite","ep025"
"13024",645,"you don't usually see a kitchen on the","ep025"
"13025",648,"third floor yeah honestly this kitchen","ep025"
"13026",651,"is much better than the one downstairs","ep025"
"13027",654,"it's so much better than the one not","ep025"
"13028",657,"dated but I'm certainly not gonna serve","ep025"
"13029",660,"food on the third floor Yeah right let's","ep025"
"13030",663,"take a look at the second bedroom up","ep025"

"13033",672,"this is very cozy a little bedroom I","ep025"
"13034",675,"really like this room this could be like","ep025"
"13035",678,"a playroom or something like that to be","ep025"
"13036",681,"decided I feel like there's a lot of","ep025"
"13037",684,"potential in this home for you guys but","ep025"
"13038",687,"what are the both of you think the","ep025"
"13039",690,"historical elements are really preserved","ep025"
"13040",693,"in this house which is super important","ep025"
"13041",696,"to me and I love that honestly I think","ep025"
"13042",699,"the outdoor entertaining space is just","ep025"
"13043",702,"really spectacular I really like that","ep025"
"13044",705,"it's open concept between the living","ep025"
"13045",708,"room in the dining room but it still","ep025"
"13046",711,"shuts off the kitchen from the rest of","ep025"
"13047",714,"the house and then you know the master","ep025"
"13048",717,"bathroom is is just clearly too small","ep025"

"13527",423,"we need to spend money on to renovate","ep026"
"13528",426,"and the price over our budget this is","ep026"
"13529",429,"just a beautiful area imagine the girls","ep026"
"13530",432,"what about me I'm gonna love the pool","ep026"
"13531",435,"it's really awesome well what do you","ep026"

"13534",444,"probably gonna look at 50 minutes 50","ep026"
"13535",447,"minutes yes that's a long time and the","ep026"
"13536",450,"other thing we've already talked about","ep026"
"13537",453,"is the price it's way over budget well","ep026"
"13538",456,"look at it you can see why I can't see","ep026"
"13539",459,"there's been an awesome place for our","ep026"
"13540",462,"family I just don't know","ep026"
"13541",465,"are we talking within our budget the","ep026"
"13542",468,"price comes down Peter this one's worth","ep026"
"13543",471,"six hundred and seventy thousand but not","ep026"
"13544",474,"quite enough for Peter to hear isn't","ep026"
"13545",477,"this beautiful when Peters job in Alaska","ep026"
"13546",480,"came to an end and he chose to move his","ep026"
"13547",483,"family to his native Australia","ep026"
"13548",486,"Ellen knew it would mean big changes for","ep026"
"13549",489,"her and her daughter's we had such an","ep026"
"13550",492,"amazing community in Alaska that people","ep026"
"13551",495,"were just incredible and that's what","ep026"
"13552",498,"fuels me is to have that community","ep026"
"13553",501,"around us for Peter it's a homecoming","ep026"
"13554",504,"but he's facing challenges of his own","ep026"
"13555",507,"I'm excited and nervous about moving to","ep026"
"13556",510,"Australia yeah excited because it is","ep026"
"13557",513,"back to a place that I know a place that","ep026"
"13558",516,"I love but I'm bidding nervous about the","ep026"
"13559",519,"job and bringing the girls up and that","ep026"
"13560",522,"Helen will get to live here so we'll see","ep026"
"13561",525,"how that goes so beautiful but with","ep026"
"13562",528,"Helen and the girls adjusting to a place","ep026"
"13563",531,"they've never been Peters needs are","ep026"
"13564",534,"taking a bit of a backseat on the house","ep026"
"13565",537,"side so what's my commute time gonna be","ep026"
"13566",540,"I would imagine maybe allow 50 minutes","ep026"
"13567",543,"50 minutes yes that's quite a long way","ep026"
"13568",546,"each way each day that's a lot of time","ep026"
"13569",549,"not being with the family Wow but Helen","ep026"
"13570",552,"is already finding things she likes","ep026"
"13571",555,"about Australia can you imagine the","ep026"
"13572",558,"girls love the girls what about me I can","ep026"
"13573",561,"see our family being really happy here","ep026"
"13574",564,"they can run around they can jump in the","ep026"
"13575",567,"pool they're gonna have a blast","ep026"
"13576",570,"well budgets at 650,000 but I just think","ep026"
"13577",573,"for the right place it's worth","ep026"
"13578",576,"stretching in it although it's really","ep026"
"13579",579,"good","ep026"
"13580",582,"with house 2 Derrick tries to lower the","ep026"
"13581",585,"price","ep026"
"13582",588,"but that means compromising on location","ep026"
"13583",591,"the challenge with this one is the","ep026"
"13584",594,"commute for the kids","ep026"
"13585",597,"I don't know that Helens going to be","ep026"
"13586",600,"able to overcome the drive I'm taking","ep026"

"13588",606,"Peter you're concerned about commute I","ep026"
"13589",609,"think this one's going to be absolutely","ep026"
"13590",612,"perfect for you I'm more concerned about","ep026"
"13591",615,"the distance from the school it's only a","ep026"
"13592",618,"short 10-minute Drive it's a 4-bedroom","ep026"
"13593",621,"2-bathroom home how much are we talking","ep026"

"13780",1182,"Peter being a stickler for the budget","ep026"
"13781",1185,"helen is concerned that she and the","ep026"
"13782",1188,"girls won't get a spacious home with a","ep026"
"13783",1191,"pool why don't we talk about that real","ep026"
"13784",1194,"expensive one first a great location I","ep026"
"13785",1197,"love that place can you imagine the","ep026"
"13786",1200,"girls love girls what about me I","ep026"
"13787",1203,"couldn't see this being an awesome place","ep026"
"13788",1206,"for our family it was a little bit far","ep026"
"13789",1209,"from work and it was too expensive it's","ep026"
"13790",1212,"coming at six hundred and eighty","ep026"
"13791",1215,"thousand 680 and it was two stories","ep026"
"13792",1218,"usually I really like it when Helens","ep026"
"13793",1221,"happy that's excellent but in this case","ep026"
"13794",1224,"do you really like an expensive house","ep026"
"13795",1227,"that was close to work for you so that","ep026"
"13796",1230,"was good I like the location I think","ep026"
"13797",1233,"you'd find community here and I'm close","ep026"
"13798",1236,"enough to work that I'd be able to be","ep026"
"13799",1239,"around with us that's what he was hoping","ep026"
"13800",1242,"for it was over budget again but he was","ep026"
"13801",1245,"willing to compromise on the budget for","ep026"
"13802",1248,"this one because of the location but","ep026"
"13803",1251,"having the two storeys meant we had that","ep026"
"13804",1254,"great parent retreat that says wow yeah","ep026"
"13805",1257,"this is not bad so much space","ep026"
"13806",1260,"and look at that view how about the","ep026"
"13807",1263,"single story","ep026"
"13808",1266,"this is one story Derek looks fantastic","ep026"
"13809",1269,"Derek one story excellent that was only","ep026"
"13810",1272,"six hundred and twenty thousand well","ep026"
"13811",1275,"within our budget","ep026"
"13812",1278,"and I had a pool have much natural","ep026"
"13813",1281,"sunlight and there was no player outside","ep026"
"13814",1284,"for the kids I can see us out here with","ep026"
"13815",1287,"the girls in the pool we just sit here","ep026"
"13816",1290,"very awesome","ep026"
"13817",1293,"he was really happy at this place it was","ep026"
"13818",1296,"close to the school so maybe I can","ep026"
"13819",1299,"compromise","ep026"
"13820",1302,"[Music]","ep026"
"13821",1305,"look I think we need to rule one out","ep026"
"13822",1308,"okay the one thing on our wish list that","ep026"
"13823",1311,"we've all agreed on even the girls is","ep026"
"13824",1314,"that we really want a pool so you think","ep026"
"13825",1317,"the one we are up or we could rule that","ep026"
"13826",1320,"out","ep026"
"13827",1323,"I think we should rule that one out so","ep026"
"13828",1326,"I'd have to compromise on location yeah","ep026"
"13829",1329,"and that means we'll definitely get a","ep026"
"13830",1332,"pool yeah","ep026"
"13831",1335,"I really like the single story I think","ep026"
"13832",1338,"there's got no stairs it's great price","ep026"
"13833",1341,"and it's got everything we want well","ep026"
"13834",1344,"you've got to remember you also really","ep026"
"13835",1347,"like the big backyard in that two-story","ep026"
"13836",1350,"place and that the room for us to grow","ep026"
"13837",1353,"as a family we've already compromised","ep026"
"13838",1356,"for your location and we'll get the","ep026"
"13839",1359,"right budget it's got the pool I think","ep026"
"13840",1362,"that's the one yes but it didn't have a","ep026"
"13841",1365,"very big backyard to it because it was a","ep026"
"13842",1368,"single-story it took up the whole plot","ep026"
"13843",1371,"area I just can't see our family living","ep026"
"13844",1374,"there we're here in Australia we've got","ep026"
"13845",1377,"beautiful summers we want this outdoor","ep026"
"13846",1380,"lifestyle I think we need the place with","ep026"
"13847",1383,"the big pool and the big backyard grass","ep026"
"13848",1386,"area for the kids","ep026"
"13849",1389,"true but the one-story home has the","ep026"
"13850",1392,"right price we can stretch the budget","ep026"
"13851",1395,"for the right home and this is the right","ep026"
"13852",1398,"home it is a really nice big backyard","ep026"
"13853",1401,"it's got the beautiful pool on the kids","ep026"
"13854",1404,"to enjoy it and I want you to be happy I","ep026"
"13855",1407,"think we've made a decision","ep026"
"13856",1410,"this is definitely the right place for","ep026"
"13857",1413,"us and for our family it's so good being","ep026"
"13858",1416,"close to the school it's just a quick","ep026"
"13859",1419,"five minute walk it just makes it so","ep026"
"13860",1422,"much easier I really like standing here","ep026"
"13861",1425,"looking out at the pool and then some of","ep026"
"13862",1428,"the kids will be able to play out there","ep026"
"13863",1431,"and fantastic and the amazing thing is","ep026"
"13864",1434,"that I've actually left the job in the","ep026"
"13865",1437,"city and I've got a fantastic job at the","ep026"

"13963",255,"walking distance to the beach I mean","ep027"
"13964",258,"that's pretty important that's part of","ep027"
"13965",261,"the reason why I'm moving to San","ep027"
"13966",264,"Clemente right it's a beach town you","ep027"
"13967",267,"know I want to be as close to the water","ep027"
"13968",270,"as possible I love the idea of living","ep027"
"13969",273,"close to the water being able to come","ep027"
"13970",276,"home on a Friday park my car in the","ep027"
"13971",279,"garage and then just not touch it all","ep027"

"13978",300,"him East just a little bit east to the","ep027"
"13979",303,"same price you get so much more sickled","ep027"
"13980",306,"many slopes up as you get east of five","ep027"
"13981",309,"and so you're gonna get way more ocean","ep027"
"13982",312,"views the further away you get from the","ep027"
"13983",315,"water I realized that my budgets not","ep027"
"13984",318,"gonna give me everything I want but if","ep027"
"13985",321,"we can get 90% of the way there I think","ep027"
"13986",324,"I'll be more than happy in my new home I","ep027"
"13987",327,"definitely want a minimum of two","ep027"
"13988",330,"bedrooms two bathrooms I also really","ep027"
"13989",333,"want an outdoor entertaining space so I","ep027"
"13990",336,"could have my friends over and barbecue","ep027"
"13991",339,"entertain some things that I definitely","ep027"
"13992",342,"want to avoid would be an HOA if I can","ep027"
"13993",345,"and then if it's if it needs too much","ep027"
"13994",348,"work I would definitely prefer","ep027"
"13995",351,"move-in-ready the thing I'm looking","ep027"
"13996",354,"forward to most about having my own","ep027"
"13997",357,"place in San Clemente is just getting","ep027"
"13998",360,"all my friends together for a big","ep027"
"13999",363,"barbecue in the backyard being able to","ep027"
"14000",366,"finally entertain in my own place for me","ep027"
"14001",369,"right now in my stage of life I think it","ep027"
"14002",372,"makes a lot of sense to be close to the","ep027"
"14003",375,"water walk right to the beach that's","ep027"
"14004",378,"kind of my priority right now are you","ep027"
"14005",381,"gonna shred dinar or observe from afar","ep027"
"14006",384,"these are important questions","ep027"
"14007",387,"today Trevor is showing David a house","ep027"
"14008",390,"that's west of the five freeway and just","ep027"
"14009",393,"blocks from the beach you're literally","ep027"
"14010",396,"walking distance to all the shops and","ep027"
"14011",399,"restaurants down here nice this is the","ep027"
"14012",402,"lifestyle this is the beach very cool","ep027"
"14013",405,"and this is the house this is the house","ep027"
"14014",408,"it definitely has that beach bungalow","ep027"
"14015",411,"look that I was looking for the house","ep027"
"14016",414,"itself is two bedrooms one bath 883","ep027"
"14017",417,"square feet","ep027"
"14018",420,"they're asking seven hundred nineteen","ep027"
"14019",423,"thousand eight hundred eighty three","ep027"
"14020",426,"that's tiny we're at the beach yeah I","ep027"
"14021",429,"guess yeah I guess it is the beach but","ep027"
"14022",432,"it only has one bath I really wanted to","ep027"
"14023",435,"I think it's a rude awakening for Dave","ep027"
"14024",438,"it's not what everybody thinks that much","ep027"
"14025",441,"money could get but the reality is here","ep027"
"14026",444,"at the beach this is what you get so I","ep027"
"14027",447,"think given the budget that Dave is set","ep027"
"14028",450,"for me it's gonna be a lot of","ep027"
"14029",453,"compromises on his end Wow nice yeah I","ep027"
"14030",456,"definitely need some updating I think","ep027"
"14031",459,"but the room is kind of good-sized good","ep027"
"14032",462,"layout this carpet though would really","ep027"
"14033",465,"have to go I think I'd want to put in","ep027"
"14034",468,"wood floors probably sure and maybe we","ep027"
"14035",471,"could even continue this wood floor from","ep027"
"14036",474,"the kitchen so yeah I really do like","ep027"
"14037",477,"these floors so these are original of","ep027"
"14038",480,"the house you think yeah I think so yeah","ep027"
"14039",483,"it's got they got a lot of character I","ep027"
"14040",486,"like them I like the brick backsplash","ep027"
"14041",489,"and walls that's pretty cool too yeah it","ep027"
"14042",492,"goes with the rustic charm of the house","ep027"
"14043",495,"yeah","ep027"
"14044",498,"the countertops though are looking a","ep027"
"14045",501,"little dated I think I'd probably want","ep027"
"14046",504,"her place does yeah we could get a nice","ep027"
"14047",507,"granite in here pretty easily and I love","ep027"
"14048",510,"these beams on the ceiling yeah it's","ep027"
"14049",513,"really cool you know it's not a huge","ep027"
"14050",516,"kitchen but for me it would probably","ep027"
"14051",519,"work fine I mean it's a great kitchen","ep027"
"14052",522,"for the size of the home very functional","ep027"
"14053",525,"cool ah so this is the one and only","ep027"
"14054",528,"bathroom on one and only bathroom your","ep027"
"14055",531,"master your guest your powder room","ep027"
"14056",534,"everything all right here those showers","ep027"
"14057",537,"pretty nice I like the jetted tub and","ep027"
"14058",540,"it's got the wainscoting so it's got","ep027"
"14059",543,"that Beach coastal flair to it that is","ep027"
"14060",546,"cool and I like the wood floors too yeah","ep027"
"14061",549,"they're cool wood floors all right I","ep027"
"14062",552,"mean I definitely like to have two","ep027"
"14063",555,"bathrooms but this is actually a pretty","ep027"
"14064",558,"good-size bathroom so we're having one","ep027"
"14065",561,"bathroom this is pretty nice yeah David","ep027"
"14066",564,"sees a second bedroom that could be used","ep027"
"14067",567,"as an office space before heading to the","ep027"
"14068",570,"master bedroom all right very cool I","ep027"
"14069",573,"think it's pretty good-sized and I like","ep027"
"14070",576,"the fact that it's got the big sliding","ep027"
"14071",579,"doors to lead out to the patio yeah for","ep027"
"14072",582,"sure","ep027"
"14073",585,"and I'm noticing this","ep027"
"14074",588,"window this is a little bay window they","ep027"
"14075",591,"put in here it's not cool interesting","ep027"
"14076",594,"funky little touch yeah I think overall","ep027"
"14077",597,"it's a good room yeah the one thing to","ep027"
"14078",600,"notice though is if your guests you want","ep027"
"14079",603,"to go to the back yard from the house","ep027"
"14080",606,"they will be passing through your master","ep027"
"14081",609,"bed yeah that's not ideal wow this is I","ep027"
"14082",612,"have to say this is bigger than I was","ep027"
"14083",615,"expecting for a beach property a normal","ep027"
"14084",618,"of each properties don't have yards this","ep027"
"14085",621,"big and this is definitely an exception","ep027"
"14086",624,"so it's cool to have absolutely and it's","ep027"
"14087",627,"really private with these the trees","ep027"
"14088",630,"around the edge it's yeah it's nice I","ep027"
"14089",633,"want to show you the most beachy part of","ep027"
"14090",636,"this property alright and that's the","ep027"
"14091",639,"outdoor shower","ep027"
"14092",642,"nice yeah you gotta have an outdoor","ep027"
"14093",645,"shower if you have three blocks from the","ep027"
"14094",648,"beach it's pretty much required by code","ep027"
"14095",651,"yeah","ep027"
"14096",654,"finishing off the backyard is a casita","ep027"
"14097",657,"the guest house casita is super cool I","ep027"
"14098",660,"like the fact that it converted the","ep027"
"14099",663,"garage and it provides an extra square","ep027"
"14100",666,"footage that I could use for a guest","ep027"
"14101",669,"room so I think it's a really nice","ep027"
"14102",672,"feature yeah","ep027"
"14103",675,"I'd stay here very cool yeah you have to","ep027"
"14104",678,"use outside shower though yeah we'll","ep027"
"14105",681,"talk about that","ep027"
"14106",684,"[Music]","ep027"
"14107",687,"there's a lot to like here I think","ep027"
"14108",690,"number one the location is awesome three","ep027"
"14109",693,"blocks from the beach it doesn't get","ep027"
"14110",696,"much better than that yeah it's great","ep027"
"14111",699,"and it's got really good outdoor","ep027"
"14112",702,"entertaining space that feels really","ep027"
"14113",705,"private and I know that's hard to find","ep027"
"14114",708,"this close to the water yeah so this","ep027"
"14115",711,"actually hits a lot of good points for","ep027"
"14116",714,"me on the downside this place is tiny","ep027"
"14117",717,"and it only has the one bathroom it's","ep027"
"14118",720,"definitely not turnkey if we can find","ep027"
"14119",723,"something a little bit bigger that would","ep027"
"14120",726,"be awesome","ep027"
"14121",729,"next up Trevor is taking David to see a","ep027"
"14122",732,"bigger and less expensive place but if","ep027"
"14123",735,"it sounds too good to be true I can","ep027"
"14124",738,"really hear that freeway noise","ep027"
"14125",741,"[Music]","ep027"
"14126",744,"anyone go check out the pier yeah","ep027"
"14127",747,"alright wish it was just a little","ep027"

"14129",753,"whether it is cherish cheers to that","ep027"
"14130",756,"David is looking for a home in the","ep027"
"14131",759,"Oceanside town of San Clemente","ep027"
"14132",762,"California I've been saving for a long","ep027"
"14133",765,"time for my first home and now my lease","ep027"
"14134",768,"is almost up and I just feel like now is","ep027"
"14135",771,"the right time to start looking for my","ep027"
"14136",774,"own home with a budget of 750,000","ep027"
"14137",777,"dollars he wants to live close to the","ep027"
"14138",780,"beach and it's vibrant community of","ep027"
"14139",783,"shops and restaurants specifically west","ep027"
"14140",786,"of the five freeway so far David has","ep027"
"14141",789,"seen a bungalow that's walking distance","ep027"
"14142",792,"to the beach but it's smaller than he","ep027"
"14143",795,"anticipated and it needs some more today","ep027"
"14144",798,"Trevor is taking David to another","ep027"
"14145",801,"bungalow that's a little farther from","ep027"
"14146",804,"the beach but it's bigger and less","ep027"
"14147",807,"expensive Trevor this is a cool beachy","ep027"
"14148",810,"neighborhood but I'm noticing the","ep027"
"14149",813,"freeway is literally right here yes we","ep027"
"14150",816,"are very close to the freeway and east","ep027"
"14151",819,"of the freeway right just barely what","ep027"
"14152",822,"did we say about that but the house is a","ep027"
"14153",825,"bargain because of it it's factored into","ep027"
"14154",828,"the price it's six hundred and seventy","ep027"
"14155",831,"thousand dollars I do like that that's","ep027"
"14156",834,"well under budget you're still walking","ep027"
"14157",837,"distance to the bars and restaurants and","ep027"
"14158",840,"it's totally the style you want yeah it","ep027"
"14159",843,"is that cool beach bungalow style that I","ep027"
"14160",846,"like it's a 2-bedroom 1-bath oh man I","ep027"
"14161",849,"wanted two bathrooms I know better","ep027"
"14162",852,"David like many first-time homebuyers","ep027"
"14163",855,"has a long list of things that he really","ep027"
"14164",858,"wants but there does need to be some","ep027"
"14165",861,"compromise because we are working with","ep027"
"14166",864,"the budget all right Wow yeah nice huh","ep027"
"14167",867,"pleasantly surprised I really like the","ep027"
"14168",870,"wood beam ceiling definitely kind of the","ep027"
"14169",873,"style that I like this kind of farmhouse","ep027"
"14170",876,"vibe","ep027"
"14171",879,"barn doors cool yeah it's really cool","ep027"
"14172",882,"this has a nice built in eating area","ep027"
"14173",885,"it's kind of cool makes good use of the","ep027"
"14174",888,"space mm-hmm we have a nice neutral tile","ep027"
"14175",891,"floor I do like wood tile yeah that's a","ep027"
"14176",894,"cool feature I like the finishes but the","ep027"
"14177",897,"kitchen layout is kind of weird with","ep027"
"14178",900,"like that the washer and dryer in here","ep027"
"14179",903,"you can cook your breakfast and clean","ep027"
"14180",906,"your underwear at the same time it's a","ep027"
"14181",909,"smaller home and it's an efficient use","ep027"
"14182",912,"of space it was popular in Europe okay I","ep027"
"14183",915,"guess I was hoping for more of an","ep027"
"14184",918,"American kitchen then Trevor shows Dave","ep027"
"14185",921,"a second bedroom that could be used as","ep027"
"14186",924,"an office","ep027"
"14187",927,"a guest bedroom before heading to the","ep027"
"14188",930,"only bathroom this is pretty small for","ep027"
"14189",933,"being the only bathroom in the house","ep027"
"14190",936,"beach homes near price point are gonna","ep027"
"14191",939,"be smaller in the bathrooms are gonna","ep027"
"14192",942,"reflect the size of the home all right I","ep027"
"14193",945,"mean it's definitely a negative so this","ep027"
"14194",948,"used to be the other bedroom and it","ep027"
"14195",951,"looks like they did an add-on to push it","ep027"
"14196",954,"out towards the back yard okay you know","ep027"
"14197",957,"it could be a good office they're using","ep027"
"14198",960,"it as a sitting room through here is the","ep027"
"14199",963,"sleeping area okay it'd be good for a","ep027"
"14200",966,"master you know mm-hmm it's a place to","ep027"
"14201",969,"sleep you know about it so right can't","ep027"
"14202",972,"jump on the bed this is the closet here","ep027"
"14203",975,"that's the closet all right","ep027"
"14204",978,"not a ton of room I'd want probably want","ep027"
"14205",981,"to put doors on there too mm-hmm and I","ep027"
"14206",984,"see it opens out to the patio it does so","ep027"
"14207",987,"here is the patio wow this I really like","ep027"
"14208",990,"this is awesome but you know what one","ep027"
"14209",993,"thing I'm still hearing that freeway","ep027"
"14210",996,"that freeways still there maybe you just","ep027"
"14211",999,"pretend that's the ocean here in","ep027"
"14212",1002,"Southern California we do have a lot of","ep027"
"14213",1005,"road noise freeways that sort of thing","ep027"
"14214",1008,"so a few tips and tricks for hiding that","ep027"
"14215",1011,"noise our fountains dual and triple pane","ep027"
"14216",1014,"windows great installation inside the","ep027"
"14217",1017,"walls if you can do those things he","ep027"
"14218",1020,"could get a great house for a great","ep027"
"14219",1023,"price and he'll really enjoy living here","ep027"
"14220",1026,"it really gives you an extra living area","ep027"
"14221",1029,"that you otherwise wouldn't have totally","ep027"
"14222",1032,"you get that whole indoor/outdoor flow","ep027"
"14223",1035,"yeah the outdoor living space here is","ep027"
"14224",1038,"fantastic the roofline also lends itself","ep027"
"14225",1041,"to a rooftop deck it is a possibility","ep027"
"14226",1044,"and especially with the price where it","ep027"
"14227",1047,"is at least some extra room to do things","ep027"
"14228",1050,"like sure yeah this is a really big","ep027"
"14229",1053,"selling feature having this outdoor","ep027"
"14230",1056,"entertaining space that's high on my","ep027"
"14231",1059,"list cool I mean this is a great option","ep027"
"14232",1062,"you know I feel like the inside is","ep027"
"14233",1065,"pretty turnkey you know they I like to","ep027"
"14234",1068,"style the house and I love that outdoor","ep027"
"14235",1071,"entertaining space easy access to the 5","ep027"
"14236",1074,"but I'm yeah that's that's one of the","ep027"
"14237",1077,"downsides I mean vary a little bit too","ep027"
"14238",1080,"easy access to the 5 I don't know if I","ep027"
"14239",1083,"can get past that freeway noise mm-hmm","ep027"
"14240",1086,"the kitchens really narrow","ep027"
"14241",1089,"and there's only one bathroom keep this","ep027"
"14242",1092,"place in mind because it does represent","ep027"
"14243",1095,"a really good value being this close to","ep027"
"14244",1098,"the ocean and this close to restaurants","ep027"
"14245",1101,"and shops well I really like this house","ep027"
"14246",1104,"I think I want to see something a little","ep027"
"14247",1107,"bit bigger and a little bit further from","ep027"
"14248",1110,"the freeway to meet David's wishes","ep027"
"14249",1113,"Trevor has lined up a quieter option","ep027"

"14251",1119,"taking me man this looks a little bit","ep027"
"14252",1122,"like suburbia where's the beach my own","ep027"
"14253",1125,"hat that way I know we're just east of","ep027"

"14639",525,"updated recently I like the granite it's","ep028"
"14640",528,"a nice guest bathroom this is an awkward","ep028"
"14641",531,"designed room this is weird","ep028"
"14642",534,"it's almost looks like an office space","ep028"
"14643",537,"awesome library to me and it's a little","ep028"
"14644",540,"bit awkward to be an office with this","ep028"
"14645",543,"tea shape and the slanted ceilings upset","ep028"
"14646",546,"Cape Cod coming back Cape Cod elements","ep028"
"14647",549,"[Laughter]","ep028"
"14648",552,"like what the Masters on the other side","ep028"
"14649",555,"of the house this is super awkward again","ep028"
"14650",558,"just like the other bedroom so this","ep028"
"14651",561,"bathroom is a little bit small I do like","ep028"
"14652",564,"the tile looks like it needs some work","ep028"
"14653",567,"though I'm looking at these fixtures","ep028"
"14654",570,"this gets back to when's the last time","ep028"
"14655",573,"these pipes have been updated and that's","ep028"
"14656",576,"something we can look into this house","ep028"
"14657",579,"surprised me doesn't feel like a","ep028"
"14658",582,"colonial to me at all I really don't","ep028"
"14659",585,"like the yellow brick but the first","ep028"
"14660",588,"floor was amazing with that huge","ep028"
"14661",591,"fireplace however those bedrooms with","ep028"
"14662",594,"the t-shape I felt like there was sort","ep028"
"14663",597,"of a waste of space I can sort the size","ep028"
"14664",600,"I'm think it's a lot of space to manage","ep028"
"14665",603,"the other thing is renovations and","ep028"
"14666",606,"updates that may be needed it adds up","ep028"
"14667",609,"you know I'd really love to see more of","ep028"
"14668",612,"a traditional colonial and maybe","ep028"
"14669",615,"something closer to DC okay I can","ep028"
"14670",618,"definitely make that happen","ep028"
"14671",621,"awesome but for Annie to get the updated","ep028"
"14672",624,"colonial she wants and still stay close","ep028"
"14673",627,"to DC something's got again yikes I","ep028"
"14674",630,"thought the house looked tiny now you","ep028"
"14675",633,"tell me it's tiny","ep028"
"14676",636,"[Music]","ep028"
"14677",639,"I found this awesome house it's like","ep028"
"14678",642,"5200 square feet but it's not amazing","ep028"
"14679",645,"working with $700,000 annie is searching","ep028"
"14680",648,"the Washington DC suburbs for a spacious","ep028"
"14681",651,"colonial with historic charm and","ep028"
"14682",654,"character but knowing that Annie travels","ep028"
"14683",657,"a lot for work for more practical minded","ep028"
"14684",660,"friend Tammy is pushing her to get a","ep028"
"14685",663,"smaller updated house that's easier to","ep028"
"14686",666,"manage I can camp out in a room a week","ep028"
"14687",669,"just experience you know that's a good","ep028"
"14688",672,"idea so far they've seen a colonial that","ep028"
"14689",675,"had plenty of room for Annie's library","ep028"
"14690",678,"office and dining table for 12 but it","ep028"
"14691",681,"had more of a Cape Cod feel which Annie","ep028"
"14692",684,"didn't like and was 20 miles from DC so","ep028"
"14693",687,"you asked for a colonial and I deliver","ep028"
"14694",690,"looks cute I love that it's a red brick","ep028"
"14695",693,"colonial the landscaping in the front is","ep028"
"14696",696,"beautiful and they're in Arlington","ep028"
"14697",699,"Virginia just four miles from Washington","ep028"
"14698",702,"DC built in 1946 historic elements on","ep028"
"14699",705,"the outside completely gutted though and","ep028"
"14700",708,"renovated on the inside three bedrooms","ep028"
"14701",711,"two baths price 620 another positive","ep028"
"14702",714,"1,450 square feet this is a really","ep028"
"14703",717,"highly desirable area","ep028"
"14704",720,"I know Annie's looking for more space","ep028"
"14705",723,"and when you look at what she's willing","ep028"
"14706",726,"to pay this was gonna be probably the","ep028"
"14707",729,"best in terms of the closest location","ep028"
"14708",732,"where is the driveway it's just straight","ep028"
"14709",735,"parking I mean it is permitted at night","ep028"
"14710",738,"though okay okay I think it's we're","ep028"
"14711",741,"taking a look at your but really the","ep028"
"14712",744,"nuts and bolts of","ep028"
"14713",747,"[Music]","ep028"

"14716",756,"all original I think it probably at some","ep028"
"14717",759,"point they probably had to switch some","ep028"
"14718",762,"al hmm it has molding and hardwood","ep028"
"14719",765,"floors and a lot of accents that I","ep028"
"14720",768,"really like but I do miss some of the","ep028"
"14721",771,"historic charm that Colonials have to","ep028"
"14722",774,"offer where's where's the dining room so","ep028"

"14727",789,"small space we're closer to the city it","ep028"

"14729",795,"cream though I like the updates I like","ep028"
"14730",798,"the paint color in this kitchen","ep028"
"14731",801,"I love these granite countertops the","ep028"
"14732",804,"glass pane cabinet doors it's just the","ep028"
"14733",807,"layout the fact that it is so open it is","ep028"
"14734",810,"it's inviting we can alter but it does","ep028"
"14735",813,"feel small it's a lot larger than your","ep028"
"14736",816,"condo kitchen I mean this is a pretty","ep028"
"14737",819,"functional pizza space it is but I'm","ep028"

"14745",843,"also the third bedroom I mean you might","ep028"
"14746",846,"have to use this is like a combo space","ep028"
"14747",849,"like as a guest room and your family","ep028"
"14748",852,"room right sort of like the first floor","ep028"
"14749",855,"another room might have to have ten","ep028"
"14750",858,"purposes or ignite it they look at the","ep028"
"14751",861,"attached bathroom as well doc yes and","ep028"
"14752",864,"then head upstairs to the top floor like","ep028"
"14753",867,"the stairwell","ep028"
"14754",870,"Wow once again it's really small it's","ep028"

"14758",882,"bath for people to use so okay I really","ep028"
"14759",885,"wanted two and a half baths and I really","ep028"
"14760",888,"wanted that half bath on the first level","ep028"
"14761",891,"for guests and unfortunately this","ep028"
"14762",894,"doesn't have it they look at the two","ep028"

"14764",900,"nice and big scented ceiling so a little","ep028"
"14765",903,"bit claustrophobic but the room is so","ep028"
"14766",906,"spacious that's face the fact that was","ep028"
"14767",909,"built in the 1940s and is a traditional","ep028"
"14768",912,"red brick colonial is wonderful and I","ep028"
"14769",915,"like that it's been updated and","ep028"
"14770",918,"renovated I think this car footage of 14","ep028"
"14771",921,"fifties perfect size for her to move","ep028"
"14772",924,"into but the way the rooms are cut up","ep028"
"14773",927,"their multi-purpose like the fakirs not","ep028"
"14774",930,"a clear dining room is definitely gonna","ep028"
"14775",933,"be an issue for her lifestyle doesn't","ep028"
"14776",936,"have a driveway it doesn't have a garage","ep028"
"14777",939,"it is severely lacking space pretty much","ep028"
"14778",942,"everywhere we have some other ones a","ep028"
"14779",945,"look at and we'll go from there okay","ep028"
"14780",948,"okay to give Annie the space she wants","ep028"
"14781",951,"her agents taking a chance by showing","ep028"
"14782",954,"her a newer home this is it it doesn't","ep028"
"14783",957,"look like a colonial TJ","ep028"
"14784",960,"I really love that cabinet that has the","ep028"
"14785",963,"silver that's really pretty not pretty","ep028"
"14786",966,"Annie wants to honor her Mayflower roots","ep028"
"14787",969,"by buying an older colonial style home","ep028"
"14788",972,"in the Washington DC suburbs but in her","ep028"
"14789",975,"$700,000 price range","ep028"
"14790",978,"finding a house with the architectural","ep028"
"14791",981,"detail she likes and the space she needs","ep028"
"14792",984,"has been a challenge so far she and her","ep028"
"14793",987,"close friend Tammy have seen a colonial","ep028"
"14794",990,"in Herndon 20 miles from DC she liked","ep028"
"14795",993,"the historic details inside but the","ep028"
"14796",996,"layout was awkward and it needed work","ep028"
"14797",999,"then they saw a red brick colonial in","ep028"
"14798",1002,"Arlington just four miles from DC she","ep028"
"14799",1005,"liked the upgrades but was concerned","ep028"
"14800",1008,"that it was too small so now they're","ep028"
"14801",1011,"back in Herndon to look at a newer more","ep028"
"14802",1014,"spacious house like a colonial TJ you","ep028"
"14803",1017,"know it's listed as a traditional with","ep028"
"14804",1020,"some Victorian elements while she wanted","ep028"
"14805",1023,"the colonial the thing that really spoke","ep028"
"14806",1026,"to me is that she wanted charm and","ep028"
"14807",1029,"character in the house this house has","ep028"
"14808",1032,"that in spades also to the fact that","ep028"
"14809",1035,"it's newer versus older there's less","ep028"
"14810",1038,"maintenance less renovation price on","ep028"
"14811",1041,"this house six hundred thousand that is","ep028"
"14812",1044,"nice but no driving the balances yeah","ep028"
"14813",1047,"there's no driveway no garage but it's a","ep028"
"14814",1050,"little over 2,200 square feet it's a","ep028"
"14815",1053,"little bit smaller than I was hoping for","ep028"

"15089",318,"house is not an entirely an open floor","ep029"

"15109",378,"have enough cabinets that is true they","ep029"
"15110",381,"see a powder room off the kitchen before","ep029"
"15111",384,"heading down to the basement all right I","ep029"
"15112",387,"like this I like this a lot there's a","ep029"
"15113",390,"little small but it still gives you that","ep029"
"15114",393,"separation you want it so you can have","ep029"
"15115",396,"that formal living room upstairs and","ep029"
"15116",399,"downstairs you're gonna have the kids","ep029"
"15117",402,"upstairs on the second floor are three","ep029"
"15118",405,"guest bedrooms I think it's a good size","ep029"
"15119",408,"for an office and the master suite this","ep029"
"15120",411,"is kind of an odd shape but you see how","ep029"
"15121",414,"it's almost like a hunk of the room it's","ep029"
"15122",417,"sort of cut out it's big enough for a","ep029"
"15123",420,"king-size bed in here so it's an odd","ep029"
"15124",423,"space but it's a lot of space all right","ep029"
"15125",426,"let's check out the master bathroom it's","ep029"
"15126",429,"very modern but it's so small and you","ep029"

"15128",435,"just a shower I use a baths as a way to","ep029"
"15129",438,"relax and the fact that this master bath","ep029"
"15130",441,"does not have a spa tub is disappointing","ep029"
"15131",444,"to me I think I like it more than I","ep029"
"15132",447,"don't I like the fact that the yard is","ep029"
"15133",450,"large I love the deck but it really does","ep029"
"15134",453,"concern me because what am I gonna have","ep029"
"15135",456,"to just kind of stand in the kitchen and","ep029"
"15136",459,"look out the window at them as they're","ep029"
"15137",462,"enjoying this doesn't necessarily have","ep029"
"15138",465,"the open floor plan that I desired but I","ep029"
"15139",468,"really don't care for that master yeah I","ep029"

"15174",573,"I'd open it something great well you","ep029"

"15180",591,"here oh wow more like a dinette do","ep029"
"15181",594,"that's disappointing","ep029"
"15182",597,"I don't even know if her table would fit","ep029"
"15183",600,"in there no I definitely wouldn't fit","ep029"
"15184",603,"you just have to make sure you have room","ep029"
"15185",606,"for a refrigerator oh my goodness and","ep029"
"15186",609,"the dishwasher don't freeze no","ep029"
"15187",612,"dishwasher and a small dining room table","ep029"
"15188",615,"225 thousand join in 25,000 ideally I","ep029"
"15189",618,"would not be in favor of a big","ep029"
"15190",621,"renovation however there are so many","ep029"
"15191",624,"things that we could potentially do with","ep029"
"15192",627,"this house I wouldn't be opposed to","ep029"
"15193",630,"sitting down with the contractor and","ep029"
"15194",633,"talking through some things","ep029"
"15195",636,"oh this is nice it reminds me of patios","ep029"
"15196",639,"back in Florida I like the size I like","ep029"
"15197",642,"the openness of it mm-hmm I definitely","ep029"
"15198",645,"like the how the glass is you know the","ep029"
"15199",648,"doors go the whole way around and that's","ep029"
"15200",651,"all of the Sun come in and then right","ep029"
"15201",654,"over here is the koi pond oh this is","ep029"

"15203",660,"that being so let's check out the","ep029"
"15204",663,"outdoor area okay","ep029"
"15205",666,"wow this is nice to me this ride is","ep029"
"15206",669,"pretty big and I'm already concerned","ep029"
"15207",672,"about my allergies Keisha's allergies","ep029"
"15208",675,"are are definitely concerned but I love","ep029"
"15209",678,"the size of the yard and the kids would","ep029"
"15210",681,"definitely have a joy in playing in it","ep029"
"15211",684,"I'm a little nervous with the pool just","ep029"
"15212",687,"seems like it we have the potential to","ep029"
"15213",690,"be a little dangerous if even if we're","ep029"
"15214",693,"out here neither of us are really","ep029"
"15215",696,"swimmers back inside there's a","ep029"
"15216",699,"bathroom and two guest bedrooms I think","ep029"
"15217",702,"this could be actually a nice office","ep029"
"15218",705,"space so this room actually would be","ep029"
"15219",708,"considered your master bedroom","ep029"
"15220",711,"Wow it's the largest bedroom on this","ep029"
"15221",714,"floor wow this is small SRIA","ep029"
"15222",717,"I'll get it would not fit in here they","ep029"
"15223",720,"head downstairs to a finished basement","ep029"
"15224",723,"this absolutely could work as another","ep029"
"15225",726,"living space the TV could easily fit","ep029"
"15226",729,"there also - there's enough room for the","ep029"
"15227",732,"kids to run around and play in all right","ep029"
"15228",735,"now this bedroom also has a bathroom","ep029"
"15229",738,"attached to it so this could be","ep029"
"15230",741,"considered a master bedroom suite move","ep029"
"15231",744,"I'm not sure how I feel about the the","ep029"
"15232",747,"master suite not being on the same level","ep029"
"15233",750,"as the kids like that's something that's","ep029"
"15234",753,"pretty important to me okay it","ep029"
"15235",756,"definitely has the jetted tub this is","ep029"
"15236",759,"nice it is perfect all right so what do","ep029"
"15237",762,"you guys think I love the fact that you","ep029"
"15238",765,"found us a ranch that's just fabulous","ep029"
"15239",768,"the kitchen no I think probably we have","ep029"
"15240",771,"to gut this outside is absolutely","ep029"
"15241",774,"beautiful","ep029"
"15242",777,"my allergies will go crazy back there","ep029"
"15243",780,"was that great the bedroom in the","ep029"
"15244",783,"basement is not gonna work well for us","ep029"
"15245",786,"but something that I just thought about","ep029"
"15246",789,"maybe that could function as my office","ep029"
"15247",792,"that is true so now their agents lined","ep029"
"15248",795,"up a house she thinks will appeal to","ep029"
"15249",798,"both of them I love the landscape I love","ep029"
"15250",801,"the brick I really like this","ep029"
"15251",804,"[Music]","ep029"
"15252",807,"Kiesha and al are tired of townhouse","ep029"
"15253",810,"living and are eager for more space in","ep029"
"15254",813,"Lancaster Pennsylvania working with a","ep029"
"15255",816,"two hundred and eighty thousand dollar","ep029"
"15256",819,"budget they've seen a two-story colonial","ep029"
"15257",822,"with space for a home office for Keisha","ep029"
"15258",825,"it was at the top of their budget but","ep029"
"15259",828,"wasn't Alice preferred ranch-style then","ep029"
"15260",831,"they saw an under budget ranch with a","ep029"
"15261",834,"huge finished basement for Al but there","ep029"
"15262",837,"wasn't a formal dining room for Keisha a","ep029"
"15263",840,"nice swing smooth follow through I'm","ep029"
"15264",843,"going to step back and let you do it","ep029"
"15265",846,"so now they're headed to another option","ep029"
"15266",849,"a brick colonial that should be right up","ep029"
"15267",852,"his alley","ep029"
"15268",855,"not your ranch al but it's absolutely","ep029"
"15269",858,"gorgeous what do you think I love the","ep029"
"15270",861,"landscape I love the brick I really like","ep029"
"15271",864,"this this is three bedrooms three full","ep029"
"15272",867,"bathrooms a little under 1,800 square","ep029"
"15273",870,"feet and 270,000 all right Wow we're","ep029"
"15274",873,"still on the budget this is beautiful","ep029"
"15275",876,"and it's open and I actually like it but","ep029"
"15276",879,"I just really struggle with how would we","ep029"
"15277",882,"be able to keep the kids safe in here","ep029"
"15278",885,"today I think they would just running","ep029"
"15279",888,"and knocking things over because there","ep029"
"15280",891,"isn't a way to sort of stop them but","ep029"
"15281",894,"that's the point of why I wanted an open","ep029"
"15282",897,"floor plan so they could just run and we","ep029"
"15283",900,"can see where they were going I wouldn't","ep029"
"15284",903,"touch it well this is nice it's very","ep029"
"15285",906,"nice I like the floating cabinet mm-hmm","ep029"
"15286",909,"well this is definitely an updated","ep029"
"15287",912,"traditional style kitchen I think is","ep029"
"15288",915,"perfect so this space would be","ep029"
"15289",918,"considered your dining area but Keisha","ep029"
"15290",921,"this house only has three bedrooms so","ep029"
"15291",924,"this would also have to function as your","ep029"
"15292",927,"home office I really want something","ep029"
"15293",930,"that's separate and off by itself well","ep029"
"15294",933,"there is a basement space that you might","ep029"
"15295",936,"be able to use I guess there's something","ep029"
"15296",939,"to think about now the bathroom on this","ep029"
"15297",942,"floor is a","ep029"
"15298",945,"bathroom with a shower suddenly sighs I","ep029"
"15299",948,"like that there is a shower mm-hmm hey","ep029"
"15300",951,"step outside to see the backyard I love","ep029"
"15301",954,"this yard space I like the brick I like","ep029"
"15302",957,"the stone this is not perfect for your","ep029"
"15303",960,"allergies right absolutely perfect for","ep029"
"15304",963,"my allergies","ep029"
"15305",966,"it's pristinely maintained I don't know","ep029"
"15306",969,"if I will be able to keep it up back","ep029"
"15307",972,"inside they head downstairs to the","ep029"
"15308",975,"basement Keisha I already know what","ep029"
"15309",978,"you're gonna say this is it because it","ep029"
"15310",981,"would either have to be their office the","ep029"
"15311",984,"play area that like it's not gonna be","ep029"
"15312",987,"able to double I am really disappointed","ep029"
"15313",990,"with the basement it's small I have no","ep029"
"15314",993,"idea what we would do with that space","ep029"
"15315",996,"upstairs on the second floor they see a","ep029"
"15316",999,"full bath and a possible office for","ep029"
"15317",1002,"Keisha I definitely see where it could","ep029"
"15318",1005,"function as an office space but and it","ep029"
"15319",1008,"would make us lose a bedroom and since","ep029"
"15320",1011,"this is only a three-bedroom we need the","ep029"
"15321",1014,"rooms for kids so this is the master","ep029"
"15322",1017,"bedroom","ep029"
"15323",1020,"wow this is nice very nice I like the","ep029"
"15324",1023,"fact that the bed is like tucked away in","ep029"
"15325",1026,"like a little cubby mm-hmm right over","ep029"
"15326",1029,"here is the master bathroom I love that","ep029"
"15327",1032,"it has a separate door the double sinks","ep029"
"15328",1035,"are very nice but where is the shower","ep029"
"15329",1038,"the shower is actually in the same space","ep029"
"15330",1041,"with the toilet we would not be able to","ep029"
"15331",1044,"get in there could you imagine me in the","ep029"
"15332",1047,"shower and you honor the fact that it","ep029"
"15333",1050,"doesn't have a regular tub and most","ep029"
"15334",1053,"certainly not a spa tub is disappointing","ep029"
"15335",1056,"to me the final bedroom is upstairs in","ep029"
"15336",1059,"an attic space Wow I don't even think","ep029"
"15337",1062,"you'll be able to stand up in here oh","ep029"
"15338",1065,"wow yeah the ceilings look really low","ep029"
"15339",1068,"I think Rex might like it up here but","ep029"
"15340",1071,"little guys hmm","ep029"
"15341",1074,"I want me comfortable with that yeah","ep029"
"15342",1077,"all right guys so what do you think it's","ep029"
"15343",1080,"not my ranch but she did gives me an","ep029"
"15344",1083,"open floor plan but the open floor plan","ep029"
"15345",1086,"still just really concerns me with our","ep029"
"15346",1089,"very small children now I love that","ep029"
"15347",1092,"backyard I love that there's limited","ep029"
"15348",1095,"grass the garden is beautiful I don't","ep029"
"15349",1098,"know if I could manage the upkeep now","ep029"
"15350",1101,"Keisha and I'll have to decide what's","ep029"
"15351",1104,"most important an allergy friendly yard","ep029"
"15352",1107,"an open floor plan or office space for","ep029"
"15353",1110,"Keisha I think we need to make a","ep029"
"15354",1113,"decision okay let's make it I think we","ep029"
"15355",1116,"need to make a decision okay with a","ep029"
"15356",1119,"280,000 dollar budget Keisha I'll are","ep029"
"15357",1122,"eager to get more space for their","ep029"
"15358",1125,"growing family and decide on a house so","ep029"
"15359",1128,"what do you think about the great","ep029"
"15360",1131,"two-story colonial that's 280,000 I like","ep029"
"15361",1134,"that the rooms are sectioned off at","ep029"
"15362",1137,"their walls that clearly define where","ep029"
"15363",1140,"the living room is the dining room","ep029"
"15364",1143,"the dining room might be a bit small but","ep029"
"15365",1146,"you know what I absolutely love the deck","ep029"
"15366",1149,"out back it could be a nice entertaining","ep029"
"15367",1152,"space but that yard is humongous I know","ep029"
"15368",1155,"you think that I could take allergy","ep029"
"15369",1158,"medicine but that's a lie the basement","ep029"
"15370",1161,"in this house","ep029"
"15371",1164,"I see where it perhaps could be a TV","ep029"
"15372",1167,"room but where would the kids be able to","ep029"
"15373",1170,"have their area down there and that was","ep029"
"15374",1173,"one of the things that we said was","ep029"
"15375",1176,"pretty important to us the master","ep029"
"15376",1179,"bathroom it's definitely very modern","ep029"
"15377",1182,"contemporary and newly done but it's not","ep029"
"15378",1185,"what I wanted there isn't a tub like I","ep029"
"15379",1188,"really really wanted a spa tub and","ep029"
"15380",1191,"there's just a Steve and shower so what","ep029"
"15381",1194,"do you think about the ranch at 225","ep029"
"15382",1197,"thousand well you know I like the fact","ep029"
"15383",1200,"that it is a ranch but it's not an open","ep029"
"15384",1203,"floor plan but you know it doesn't feel","ep029"
"15385",1206,"and close to me yeah I'd agree","ep029"
"15386",1209,"there isn't a dining room right now you","ep029"
"15387",1212,"know in terms of the kitchen the size of","ep029"
"15388",1215,"it just would not work it definitely","ep029"
"15389",1218,"would be a total gut job","ep029"
"15390",1221,"but since the house is so under budget","ep029"
"15391",1224,"we can customize","ep029"
"15392",1227,"make it the way that I want to the yard","ep029"
"15393",1230,"is also something that we have to think","ep029"
"15394",1233,"about you know me you know my allergies","ep029"
"15395",1236,"that might be a bit much what did you","ep029"
"15396",1239,"think about the brick colonial listed at","ep029"
"15397",1242,"two hundred and seventy thousand it was","ep029"
"15398",1245,"nice you know I absolutely love the open","ep029"
"15399",1248,"floor plan but with our kids they're","ep029"
"15400",1251,"gonna be running and knocking over","ep029"
"15401",1254,"everything and that just concerns me ya","ep029"
"15402",1257,"know I did like the dining room area yes","ep029"
"15403",1260,"I thought that was pretty nice my","ep029"
"15404",1263,"biggest concern is that where in the","ep029"
"15405",1266,"world what I put an office that will be","ep029"
"15406",1269,"your office and I have no idea how that","ep029"
"15407",1272,"could potentially work I just wouldn't","ep029"
"15408",1275,"be able to focus you know the basement","ep029"
"15409",1278,"is way too small for a media room maybe","ep029"
"15410",1281,"that could be your office the basement","ep029"
"15411",1284,"could be a space where I could sort of","ep029"
"15412",1287,"shut myself off quietly to get some work","ep029"
"15413",1290,"done the master had a really interesting","ep029"
"15414",1293,"feel to it even though it's clean it is","ep029"
"15415",1296,"relatively small so which one will they","ep029"
"15416",1299,"pick","ep029"
"15417",1302,"[Music]","ep029"
"15418",1305,"even though it has that huge yard and","ep029"
"15419",1308,"I'll probably be taking a lot of allergy","ep029"
"15420",1311,"medicine I really think the two-story","ep029"
"15421",1314,"great colonial at 280,000 might be the","ep029"
"15422",1317,"spot for us I can't talk you into that","ep029"
"15423",1320,"ranch nope","ep029"
"15424",1323,"the two-story great colonial has","ep029"
"15425",1326,"everything we need it looks like we need","ep029"
"15426",1329,"to call Serena yep the house was listed","ep029"
"15427",1332,"at 280 thousand and we ended up paying","ep029"
"15428",1335,"two hundred and eighty three five and we","ep029"
"15429",1338,"moved in about two weeks ago two weeks","ep029"
"15430",1341,"my office is working out wonderfully","ep029"
"15431",1344,"I feel so settled and focused and I","ep029"
"15432",1347,"think it allows me also to be a better","ep029"
"15433",1350,"mother and wife because I can focus","ep029"
"15434",1353,"my most favorite thing about the house","ep029"

"16294",951,"they look at two very colorful bedrooms","ep031"
"16295",954,"and a guest bathroom it's a good-size","ep031"
"16296",957,"space but the floor is a fever about at","ep031"
"16297",960,"the bottom floor downstairs more money","ep031"

"16301",972,"an in suite master bath okay this is a","ep031"

"16310",999,"for me something that's missing here is","ep031"
"16311",1002,"that charm that you might find in an","ep031"
"16312",1005,"older home it's a newer build so it","ep031"

"16314",1011,"cabinets doesn't have the crown molding","ep031"
"16315",1014,"everything's kind of plain the living","ep031"
"16316",1017,"room and the basement there's the stars","ep031"
"16317",1020,"of the house for me my big concern is","ep031"

"16327",1050,"our house","ep031"

"16329",1056,"split-level home that's move-in ready","ep031"

"16335",1074,"house of their own for under $300,000","ep031"
"16336",1077,"first they saw a 1930s colonial charmer","ep031"
"16337",1080,"with upscale move-in-ready finishes but","ep031"
"16338",1083,"it didn't have an open floor plan or a","ep031"
"16339",1086,"second full bath then they saw a larger","ep031"
"16340",1089,"newer colonial with two and a half baths","ep031"
"16341",1092,"but it was short on charm and they","ep031"
"16342",1095,"thought the kitchen bathrooms and","ep031"
"16343",1098,"flooring would need to be redone now","ep031"
"16344",1101,"their agents lined up a move-in-ready","ep031"
"16345",1104,"split level which is Jordan's favorite","ep031"
"16346",1107,"style this house is 290 thousand dollars","ep031"

"16419",1326,"cohesive throughout the house but in","ep031"
"16420",1329,"some parts of the house we've got nice","ep031"
"16421",1332,"tall ceilings but then that planted","ep031"
"16422",1335,"ceiling leading to the other parts of","ep031"
"16423",1338,"the house kind of makes me feel like a","ep031"
"16424",1341,"little claustrophobic definitely move-in","ep031"
"16425",1344,"ready that's a good thing yeah you're","ep031"
"16426",1347,"not kidding I mean I don't see any that","ep031"
"16427",1350,"we would have to make a change to well","ep031"
"16428",1353,"since none of the homes are a hundred","ep031"
"16429",1356,"percent what they're after it may come","ep031"
"16430",1359,"down to how important move-in ready","ep031"
"16431",1362,"really is to them I'm ready to get out","ep031"
"16432",1365,"of your parents house","ep031"
"16433",1368,"with up to 300,000 dollars to spend","ep031"
"16434",1371,"engaged couple Jordan and Natalie have","ep031"
"16435",1374,"been looking at options for their first","ep031"
"16436",1377,"home together okay I have all the MLS","ep031"
"16437",1380,"listings okay let's take another look","ep031"
"16438",1383,"again what are you thinking about the","ep031"
"16439",1386,"colonial for 280 it's a great house and","ep031"
"16440",1389,"has a lot of charm that I'm looking for","ep031"
"16441",1392,"well I mean the kitchen is fantastic","ep031"
"16442",1395,"that's the small of the house for me he","ep031"
"16443",1398,"doesn't need any work whatsoever the","ep031"
"16444",1401,"color is really nice gorgeous what yeah","ep031"
"16445",1404,"and the bedrooms are all upstairs three","ep031"
"16446",1407,"bedrooms nice size but there's only one","ep031"
"16447",1410,"full bathroom and a half bath downstairs","ep031"
"16448",1413,"was really small time you think I've","ep031"
"16449",1416,"ever seen in my life but a lot of good","ep031"
"16450",1419,"character aunt agree","ep031"
"16451",1422,"small-time you think I've ever seen in","ep031"
"16452",1425,"my life but a lot of good character and","ep031"
"16453",1428,"a great neighborhood and then the","ep031"
"16454",1431,"contemporary colonial or 250 it's not","ep031"
"16455",1434,"the traditional colonial it's a lot of","ep031"
"16456",1437,"space it's tall ceilings so I don't feel","ep031"
"16457",1440,"cramped it's big thing for me is a two","ep031"
"16458",1443,"and a half bathroom a lot of work needs","ep031"
"16459",1446,"to be done here the carpets need to be","ep031"
"16460",1449,"ripped out sorry I know you like carpet","ep031"
"16461",1452,"but yeah definitely not that carpet it's","ep031"
"16462",1455,"old and dated and lived in and then you","ep031"
"16463",1458,"get to the kitchen which needs a lot of","ep031"
"16464",1461,"updates but when we start pouring money","ep031"
"16465",1464,"into floors making countertops and","ep031"
"16466",1467,"cabinets I don't really know where it","ep031"
"16467",1470,"stops","ep031"
"16468",1473,"so you're again you're getting up into a","ep031"
"16469",1476,"higher price range okay what level four","ep031"
"16470",1479,"to 90 three bedrooms two full bathrooms","ep031"
"16471",1482,"that's definitely what we're looking for","ep031"
"16472",1485,"and plenty of space 1,000 square feet","ep031"
"16473",1488,"right it was open the way the house","ep031"
"16474",1491,"flowed was really nice it wasn't you","ep031"
"16475",1494,"know what I'm traditionally looking for","ep031"
"16476",1497,"that split-level in the slanted ceiling","ep031"
"16477",1500,"but it is the definition of movement","ep031"
"16478",1503,"right right it's definitely a contender","ep031"
"16479",1506,"so which one will it be","ep031"
"16480",1509,"[Music]","ep031"
"16481",1512,"thinking ahead of the future in our","ep031"
"16482",1515,"family that we want","ep031"
"16483",1518,"I think the contemporary colonial has","ep031"
"16484",1521,"that layout that we're looking for and a","ep031"
"16485",1524,"lot of space to work with","ep031"
"16486",1527,"right so it's how willing are you to","ep031"
"16487",1530,"hold off on the things that I know you","ep031"
"16488",1533,"want especially when we're looking for a","ep031"
"16489",1536,"move-in ready right maybe it's something","ep031"
"16490",1539,"that we think about what really is","ep031"
"16491",1542,"necessary to do in the very short time","ep031"
"16492",1545,"period versus long term I totally agree","ep031"
"16493",1548,"I think we have a winner","ep031"
"16494",1551,"should we call Trish yes right now okay","ep031"
"16495",1554,"awesome well I got some pans here where","ep031"
"16496",1557,"are you gonna want those even though we","ep031"
"16497",1560,"closed last week so this is still fresh","ep031"
"16498",1563,"for us two choices here okay all right","ep031"
"16499",1566,"so I got this guy right here ready right","ep031"
"16500",1569,"that looks really nice the house was","ep031"
"16501",1572,"listed at $250,000 and we were able to","ep031"
"16502",1575,"negotiate a little bit and save about","ep031"
"16503",1578,"$10,000 so $240,000 for the house and","ep031"
"16504",1581,"now as far as improvements going I think","ep031"
"16505",1584,"we'll probably be putting another 10,000","ep031"
"16506",1587,"or figuring it out for the walls we can","ep031"
"16507",1590,"have like a light gray on top and then","ep031"
"16508",1593,"like a darker gray kind of thing going","ep031"
"16509",1596,"on so up next for us is getting the","ep031"
"16510",1599,"walls painted and we definitely got to","ep031"
"16511",1602,"rip out this carpet and figure out if","ep031"
"16512",1605,"we're gonna hardwood the area or put in","ep031"
"16513",1608,"another carpet that keep you cozy","ep031"
"16514",1611,"conversations still need to happen we're","ep031"
"16515",1614,"gonna make those changes and we're gonna","ep031"
"16516",1617,"move in and you know get out of our","ep031"

"16556",102,"stuff to do we ran a small condo it's a","ep032"
"16557",105,"two-bedroom two-bath it's been great to","ep032"

"16560",114,"hour from DC for Megan's commute and are","ep032"
"16561",117,"targeting Northern Virginia suburbs like","ep032"
"16562",120,"Ashburn and Leesburg well I know you","ep032"
"16563",123,"think that 600,000 is expensive for the","ep032"
"16564",126,"house but we can take a look at what our","ep032"
"16565",129,"monthly payment would be and see if we","ep032"
"16566",132,"can afford it all right so I'll put in","ep032"
"16567",135,"six under and then where do we want to","ep032"
"16568",138,"buy maybe we just start in Leesburg","ep032"
"16569",141,"2,800 I feel like that's right now they","ep032"
"16570",144,"just need to get on the same page about","ep032"
"16571",147,"what to buy I'm looking for a brick","ep032"
"16572",150,"branch","ep032"
"16573",153,"it is because I grew up in one we plan","ep032"
"16574",156,"to start a family I would love to find","ep032"
"16575",159,"something that we can grow into and to","ep032"
"16576",162,"be her forever home so four bedrooms","ep032"
"16577",165,"would suit her just fine I think we can","ep032"
"16578",168,"contain that in something smaller like a","ep032"
"16579",171,"three-bedroom single-family colonial or","ep032"
"16580",174,"townhome something like that where we","ep032"
"16581",177,"can move in five or ten years I don't","ep032"
"16582",180,"want to move in five years I want to","ep032"
"16583",183,"just get in there and stay Chris also","ep032"
"16584",186,"doesn't want to take work home with him","ep032"
"16585",189,"so he prefers move-in-ready you work in","ep032"
"16586",192,"construction","ep032"
"16587",195,"you could small projects is great but","ep032"
"16588",198,"it's our first home so I would love to","ep032"
"16589",201,"be able to move in and enjoy it for a","ep032"
"16590",204,"little bit an updated kitchen with tons","ep032"
"16591",207,"of storage is a must I would like a","ep032"
"16592",210,"walk-in pantry growing up we put food in","ep032"
"16593",213,"cabinets here at the condo we put food","ep032"
"16594",216,"in cabinets and it would just be nice to","ep032"
"16595",219,"have in a kitchen open to a living space","ep032"
"16596",222,"would be ideal because when I'm in the","ep032"
"16597",225,"kitchen I can look out and see him","ep032"
"16598",228,"sitting on the couch so one thing for me","ep032"
"16599",231,"definitely is a nice wall to mount the","ep032"
"16600",234,"big-screen TV we just can't do it in","ep032"

"16603",243,"oh yeah hardwoods would be great for","ep032"
"16604",246,"putting a large master suite is a given","ep032"

"16608",258,"the basement or a man cave mm-hmm","ep032"
"16609",261,"somewhere we could eventually put like a","ep032"
"16610",264,"pool table or shuffleboard or a","ep032"
"16611",267,"ping-pong table or dartboard Wow another","ep032"
"16612",270,"beautiful spot I know this is gorgeous","ep032"
"16613",273,"an attached two-car garage in front and","ep032"
"16614",276,"a private yard out back round out the","ep032"
"16615",279,"list Megan and eyes aspirations are","ep032"
"16616",282,"definitely a little different I think","ep032"
"16617",285,"that's gonna be a struggle and we'll see","ep032"
"16618",288,"how it goes","ep032"
"16619",291,"cheers to our house here's the outlet","ep032"
"16620",294,"first up is a house in Sterling less","ep032"
"16621",297,"than an hour from Washington DC all","ep032"
"16622",300,"right I think this is it no garage not a","ep032"
"16623",303,"good start it's cute so bad I don't like","ep032"
"16624",306,"a ranch it's definitely more view house","ep032"
"16625",309,"than a me house but I think the commute","ep032"
"16626",312,"is great doctor ranch this is an","ep032"
"16627",315,"expanded ranch house that second-story","ep032"
"16628",318,"what you think outside not my colonial I","ep032"
"16629",321,"love the brick this is more of that","ep032"
"16630",324,"medium sized home work overall over","ep032"
"16631",327,"2,100 square feet here with 3 bedrooms 3","ep032"
"16632",330,"full baths I love that for Meghan and I","ep032"
"16633",333,"live in a 900 square foot condo so","ep032"
"16634",336,"moving to this size house I think is a","ep032"
"16635",339,"great transition for us maybe in the","ep032"
"16636",342,"future if we want to upgrade you have","ep032"
"16637",345,"the chance to do that yeah it really","ep032"
"16638",348,"doesn't make sense to me to move into a","ep032"
"16639",351,"house like this just have to move in a","ep032"
"16640",354,"couple years you're gonna be really","ep032"
"16641",357,"happy with this Chris its 425","ep032"
"16642",360,"I love 425 that's time price this is","ep032"
"16643",363,"lots of room in the budget let's go","ep032"
"16644",366,"through the house and see what you guys","ep032"
"16645",369,"have this is our formal living room we","ep032"
"16646",372,"have a bigger family room where I put my","ep032"
"16647",375,"TV yeah just off the living room is a","ep032"
"16648",378,"step up dining area tight space is good","ep032"
"16649",381,"but everything would have to go yeah","ep032"
"16650",384,"countertops the cabinet's yeah I mean","ep032"
"16651",387,"this this is a big gut we can remodel it","ep032"
"16652",390,"ourselves but for me after being on the","ep032"
"16653",393,"job site all day the last thing I really","ep032"
"16654",396,"want to do is come home and be on","ep032"
"16655",399,"another job site I like the idea of","ep032"
"16656",402,"renovating it and making my custom","ep032"
"16657",405,"kitchen and I could have like pantry I","ep032"
"16658",408,"mean we have a budget for that","ep032"
"16659",411,"and with the pass-through and the","ep032"
"16660",414,"openness here it actually feels you know","ep032"
"16661",417,"like the open-concept home yeah and you","ep032"
"16662",420,"got space for an over here yeah maybe we","ep032"
"16663",423,"could create the dining room here right","ep032"
"16664",426,"the other space to be a home office yeah","ep032"
"16665",429,"that's a good idea","ep032"
"16666",432,"this is where Chris you could have your","ep032"
"16667",435,"TV set up okay I can see us hanging","ep032"
"16668",438,"something nice in here and this leads","ep032"
"16669",441,"from the kitchen out here you actually","ep032"
"16670",444,"go out the door right here to go outside","ep032"
"16671",447,"Oh No","ep032"
"16672",450,"up in decent size and the fence gives","ep032"
"16673",453,"you some privacy as well it's got","ep032"
"16674",456,"potential back inside they see a","ep032"
"16675",459,"secondary bedroom at one time there was","ep032"
"16676",462,"a wall right here and this was two","ep032"
"16677",465,"bedrooms that's interesting I can see it","ep032"
"16678",468,"now expanse you can create two bedrooms","ep032"
"16679",471,"and now have a four bedroom home I","ep032"
"16680",474,"definitely like the idea of four","ep032"
"16681",477,"bedrooms and the bathrooms right across","ep032"
"16682",480,"the hall nice so this is where the","ep032"
"16683",483,"master suite is on the main level I","ep032"
"16684",486,"don't know if I like that yeah that","ep032"
"16685",489,"bothers me a little bit too well it is a","ep032"
"16686",492,"great size I mean it's pretty big size","ep032"
"16687",495,"king bed yeah it's a really big room","ep032"
"16688",498,"here's the master bathroom yeah we could","ep032"
"16689",501,"save some money in here I mean we want","ep032"
"16690",504,"to do much there's no tub other one has","ep032"
"16691",507,"one yeah the kids bathroom yeah let's go","ep032"
"16692",510,"take a look at the bedroom upstairs","ep032"
"16693",513,"master bedroom it could be a guest room","ep032"
"16694",516,"yeah you're right it could yeah we don't","ep032"
"16695",519,"have a basement","ep032"
"16696",522,"no basement no garage I mean those are","ep032"
"16697",525,"too big it's tougher storage well this","ep032"
"16698",528,"room does come with its own bathroom","ep032"
"16699",531,"though so if you do have gas for","ep032"
"16700",534,"somebody up here a bathroom","ep032"
"16701",537,"what you got sick of the house I mean I","ep032"
"16702",540,"like the character brick for our commute","ep032"
"16703",543,"I mean this is as good as it's gonna get","ep032"
"16704",546,"the private fenced in backyard I think","ep032"
"16705",549,"is what we're both looking for and he's","ep032"
"16706",552,"work for sure but it's below our budget","ep032"
"16707",555,"I would love a garage you know I'd love","ep032"
"16708",558,"a basement style the house I mean I I","ep032"
"16709",561,"would love to see a colonial I'm looking","ep032"
"16710",564,"for four bedrooms I'm looking for more","ep032"
"16711",567,"of our forever home so I'd like to stay","ep032"
"16712",570,"houseboat a little bit bigger than that","ep032"
"16713",573,"but getting a bigger house means looking","ep032"
"16714",576,"farther away from DC it took us a while","ep032"
"16715",579,"to get out here if we had this way we'll","ep032"
"16716",582,"hit the cannons boom well well let's get","ep032"
"16717",585,"hold it when they're not house-hunting","ep032"
"16718",588,"newlyweds Megan and Chris love exploring","ep032"
"16719",591,"the historical areas around their home","ep032"
"16720",594,"in Washington DC's Northern Virginia","ep032"
"16721",597,"suburbs this looks like a pretty decent","ep032"
"16722",600,"colonial we should put an offer in I","ep032"
"16723",603,"don't know the phone is big enough for","ep032"
"16724",606,"us with up to $600,000 to spend big","ep032"
"16725",609,"scene with their real estate agent","ep032"
"16726",612,"called an expanded ranch for Megan it","ep032"
"16727",615,"was well priced close to DC and had the","ep032"
"16728",618,"right amount of square footage for Chris","ep032"
"16729",621,"but it wasn't his colonial it needed","ep032"
"16730",624,"updating and Megan would prefer a much","ep032"
"16731",627,"larger house","ep032"
"16732",630,"[Music]","ep032"
"16733",633,"so now there are a little more than an","ep032"
"16734",636,"hour from the city to see another option","ep032"
"16735",639,"it took us a while to get out here I","ep032"
"16736",642,"know it's a little far out here but it's","ep032"
"16737",645,"an incredible home well it's definitely","ep032"
"16738",648,"not a townhome but for single family I","ep032"
"16739",651,"do love the colonial yeah it's not my","ep032"
"16740",654,"ranch","ep032"
"16741",657,"there's no brick we're 3500 square feet","ep032"
"16742",660,"four bedrooms three and a half baths I","ep032"
"16743",663,"like the size I love the two-car garage","ep032"
"16744",666,"but what are we looking at it's 575 575","ep032"
"16745",669,"you're really gonna be impressed with","ep032"
"16746",672,"what you see for the money let's go take","ep032"
"16747",675,"a look all right I know the commute a","ep032"
"16748",678,"little bit farther forth they want to go","ep032"
"16749",681,"but I think with the colonial that Chris","ep032"
"16750",684,"was looking for and the size that Megan","ep032"
"16751",687,"was hoping to find this could fit the","ep032"
"16752",690,"bill for both of them I don't know about","ep032"
"16753",693,"this room this isn't the TV viewing area","ep032"
"16754",696,"no gosh all right good what do you guys","ep032"
"16755",699,"think about the dining room it looks a","ep032"
"16756",702,"little small I do like the chair rail","ep032"
"16757",705,"it's got a nice crown molding but it's","ep032"
"16758",708,"just it's small they see the powder room","ep032"
"16759",711,"then head to a home office great a space","ep032"
"16760",714,"for furnishings as well I have one big","ep032"
"16761",717,"question does the kegerator convey with","ep032"
"16762",720,"the house that's a good one we need to","ep032"
"16763",723,"ask for that and you see the hardwoods","ep032"
"16764",726,"continue all the way out nice into the","ep032"
"16765",729,"grand family room there's big enough for","ep032"

"16779",771,"with the way the house is but when I","ep032"

"16799",831,"bedroom for you guys here yeah this","ep032"
"16800",834,"could be the guest room they see two","ep032"
"16801",837,"more bedrooms and a full bath then head","ep032"

"16812",870,"looking for more of a branch with brick","ep032"
"16813",873,"on the exterior the basement is is","ep032"
"16814",876,"probably my favorite part of the house","ep032"
"16815",879,"besides a two-car garage I love my","ep032"
"16816",882,"kitchen got the office for years as well","ep032"
"16817",885,"so a little little concerned about the","ep032"
"16818",888,"commute","ep032"
"16819",891,"I'm a little concerned that we're gonna","ep032"
"16820",894,"have to redo the kitchen or the master","ep032"
"16821",897,"bathroom it's a big house yeah but I","ep032"
"16822",900,"think it's something we can grow into I","ep032"
"16823",903,"think maybe a starter home or something","ep032"
"16824",906,"like a townhome or something a little","ep032"
"16825",909,"smaller makes a little bit more sense to","ep032"
"16826",912,"me the idea of moving so then move again","ep032"
"16827",915,"and a couple of years makes no sense to","ep032"
"16828",918,"me I mean I'd like to see something","ep032"
"16829",921,"smaller closer to the bottom of our","ep032"
"16830",924,"budget but to get a cheaper home closer","ep032"
"16831",927,"to DC Meghan may have to compromise","ep032"
"16832",930,"there's a townhome I'm loving that sound","ep032"
"16833",933,"oh yeah one of us","ep032"
"16834",936,"[Music]","ep032"
"16835",939,"all right make golf lesson time Chris","ep032"

"16838",948,"favorite sport nice I can see why you","ep032"
"16839",951,"like this anytime that it's above fifty","ep032"
"16840",954,"degrees I love to be outside hiddens","ep032"
"16841",957,"Falls Oh have a really good personality","ep032"
"16842",960,"working with $600,000 they've seen a","ep032"
"16843",963,"ranch-style home for Megan it was close","ep032"
"16844",966,"to DC and under budget but it was small","ep032"
"16845",969,"I needed updating then they saw a","ep032"
"16846",972,"colonial for Chris Megan liked the size","ep032"
"16847",975,"in the Home Office but it was farther","ep032"
"16848",978,"from DC and near the top of their budget","ep032"
"16849",981,"[Music]","ep032"
"16850",984,"so today they're in Ashburn less than an","ep032"
"16851",987,"hour from DC to see another option Chris","ep032"
"16852",990,"I've got you out to a town house not","ep032"
"16853",993,"loving it","ep032"

"16860",1014,"fifty nine thousand nine hundred dollars","ep032"
"16861",1017,"I mean high for a townhome but 3,200","ep032"

"16870",1044,"hardwood through here this is where the","ep032"

"16872",1050,"yeah this is our living space this is","ep032"
"16873",1053,"the family room / dining room this feels","ep032"
"16874",1056,"a little bit cramped me with the kitchen","ep032"
"16875",1059,"and we put a couch here and the","ep032"
"16876",1062,"television it looks like they they","ep032"

"16893",1113,"another option is here as well","ep032"
"16894",1116,"okay these also could be the home office","ep032"

"16995",1419,"the commute it's a little further away","ep032"
"16996",1422,"than we wanted to be and it's a little","ep032"

"17052",114,"first moved from Boston to Bradington it","ep033"
"17053",117,"was a culture shock and I always thought","ep033"
"17054",120,"I was gonna go back to the Northeast but","ep033"
"17055",123,"I realized down here it's such a great","ep033"

"17062",144,"about five years ago built this home","ep033"
"17063",147,"here Mike and I really planned it so","ep033"

"17065",153,"about three years ago Mike suddenly","ep033"
"17066",156,"passed away it's just kind of changed my","ep033"

"17072",174,"there's a lot of memories here good and","ep033"
"17073",177,"bad and so I've decided to sell this","ep033"
"17074",180,"house and move closer to the boys school","ep033"
"17075",183,"and the move would put Kim right by her","ep033"
"17076",186,"in-laws who help take care of the boys","ep033"
"17077",189,"when she travels for work once I made","ep033"
"17078",192,"the decision that it was you know time","ep033"
"17079",195,"to look for a new house I immediately","ep033"
"17080",198,"called Jean and Laura so we should get a","ep033"
"17081",201,"boat and all go out that would be","ep033"
"17082",204,"awesome","ep033"
"17083",207,"Laura and Jean have gone above and","ep033"
"17084",210,"beyond in their friendship and from","ep033"
"17085",213,"moment Mike passed until now they've","ep033"
"17086",216,"just been right by my side","ep033"
"17087",219,"she's just been an amazing person in my","ep033"
"17088",222,"life and her husband happens to be a","ep033"
"17089",225,"realtor which is perfect you design your","ep033"
"17090",228,"own home what would it happen I could","ep033"
"17091",231,"have whatever I wanted number one if I","ep033"
"17092",234,"could find something on the water that","ep033"
"17093",237,"has always been my dream","ep033"
"17094",240,"Mike and I always had the dream of","ep033"
"17095",243,"living on the water but now I feel like","ep033"
"17096",246,"it's but my dream to I really want to","ep033"
"17097",249,"make this happen especially for the boys","ep033"
"17098",252,"because they love to kayak and fish and","ep033"
"17099",255,"swim working with a budget of 650","ep033"
"17100",258,"thousand dollars Kim is hoping to find a","ep033"
"17101",261,"3-bed 2bath house along one of the","ep033"
"17102",264,"man-made canals that lead to the Gulf of","ep033"
"17103",267,"Mexico the inventory is kind of love for","ep033"
"17104",270,"waterfront property in that price range","ep033"
"17105",273,"okay","ep033"
"17106",276,"are you willing to do a fixer-upper I","ep033"
"17107",279,"could entertain that I've never done the","ep033"
"17108",282,"renovation I don't really know what I'm","ep033"
"17109",285,"getting myself into but I don't know","ep033"
"17110",288,"something about renovating and getting","ep033"
"17111",291,"what I want I'm kind of excited to do I","ep033"
"17112",294,"don't know if fixer-upper is the right","ep033"
"17113",297,"way to go you know what our renovation","ep033"
"17114",300,"was like I'd hate to see Kim have to","ep033"
"17115",303,"live with that kind of a headache I'd","ep033"
"17116",306,"like to see her get into some new","ep033"
"17117",309,"construction something that's move-in","ep033"
"17118",312,"ready I'm more concerned about what's","ep033"
"17119",315,"gonna be a good fit for Kim's lifestyle","ep033"
"17120",318,"as a busy working mom I was right about","ep033"
"17121",321,"condo at all I think it could be a great","ep033"
"17122",324,"fit when she's traveling it would be","ep033"
"17123",327,"great to be able to call the maintenance","ep033"
"17124",330,"person and have anything that needs to","ep033"
"17125",333,"be addressed addressed but Kim would","ep033"
"17126",336,"rather have a single-family house in","ep033"
"17127",339,"South West Florida there's a lot of","ep033"
"17128",342,"small quaint kind of beach bungalow","ep033"
"17129",345,"homes that you know I really like just","ep033"
"17130",348,"one floor simple kind of cozy what kind","ep033"
"17131",351,"of floor plan you're thinking open floor","ep033"
"17132",354,"plan would be great with an island in","ep033"
"17133",357,"the kitchen I'm hoping that in my new","ep033"
"17134",360,"house that I can have a nice granite","ep033"
"17135",363,"like I have in this house and then I","ep033"
"17136",366,"like the darker cabinets I think coming","ep033"
"17137",369,"from the Northeast I still have that","ep033"
"17138",372,"rich the woods and stuff I personally do","ep033"
"17139",375,"like the white cabinets","ep033"
"17140",378,"they are definitely very in I would like","ep033"
"17141",381,"to have the outside lanai","ep033"
"17142",384,"the pool for the boys so that they can","ep033"
"17143",387,"you know go in and out like they do now","ep033"
"17144",390,"and really look I have now the pocket","ep033"
"17145",393,"sliders like indoor/outdoor living","ep033"
"17146",396,"[Music]","ep033"
"17147",399,"I've never purchased a home by myself","ep033"
"17148",402,"before Mike and I made all those big","ep033"
"17149",405,"life changes together so this is scary","ep033"
"17150",408,"to me but I'm also really excited to","ep033"
"17151",411,"start this new chapter the right things","ep033"
"17152",414,"are gonna fall in place I can just feel","ep033"
"17153",417,"it first up a house right on the water","ep033"
"17154",420,"it was built in 1968 by a famous builder","ep033"
"17155",423,"Ruth Richmond who built about 13,000","ep033"
"17156",426,"homes in Sarasota and manatee it's a","ep033"
"17157",429,"little rough around the edges need some","ep033"
"17158",432,"work I'm looking at that I know gene are","ep033"
"17159",435,"you sure about this it looks like it","ep033"
"17160",438,"needs more than a little work and that's","ep033"
"17161",441,"not a charming bungalow yeah it needs","ep033"
"17162",444,"some work there's no doubt but I see a","ep033"
"17163",447,"lot of potential here it's a two-bedroom","ep033"
"17164",450,"three-bath home there's not a third","ep033"
"17165",453,"bedroom though yet and not yet there's","ep033"
"17166",456,"some extra rooms that I think could be","ep033"
"17167",459,"converted into a third bedroom what are","ep033"
"17168",462,"they asking for 400,000 and I think","ep033"
"17169",465,"you're gonna need to put 150 to 200,000","ep033"
"17170",468,"into it to make it exactly what you want","ep033"
"17171",471,"it to be","ep033"
"17172",474,"although 400,000 may seem like a low","ep033"
"17173",477,"price for our waterfront property it","ep033"
"17174",480,"could be that 200,000 isn't nearly","ep033"
"17175",483,"enough to fix it up it's open space it's","ep033"
"17176",486,"not as bad inside as I thought it would","ep033"
"17177",489,"be you said you wanted an open floor","ep033"
"17178",492,"plan this is an open floor plan even","ep033"
"17179",495,"though it's an older home this","ep033"
"17180",498,"particular builder built higher ceilings","ep033"
"17181",501,"she also did the terrazzo floors kind of","ep033"
"17182",504,"like this this look of this if you I","ep033"
"17183",507,"mean you'd have to fix it up a lot and","ep033"
"17184",510,"these clean up really nicely","ep033"
"17185",513,"what's the kitchen look like yeah okay","ep033"
"17186",516,"so we have some some work to do in here","ep033"
"17187",519,"as well so small I would almost see this","ep033"
"17188",522,"wall coming down completely if you can","ep033"
"17189",525,"you're looking at new cabinets new tile","ep033"
"17190",528,"new counters new appliances so I think","ep033"
"17191",531,"you're looking at one of the most","ep033"
"17192",534,"expensive parts of the project okay just","ep033"
"17193",537,"remember round","ep033"
"17194",540,"I'm okay open to fixer-upper but I'm","ep033"
"17195",543,"looking at this and I'm thinking what am","ep033"
"17196",546,"I getting myself into it oh wow it's","ep033"
"17197",549,"right on the water the waters beautiful","ep033"
"17198",552,"I love it we also have a 10,000 pound","ep033"
"17199",555,"boat lift okay","ep033"
"17200",558,"and the screened-in pool the boys are","ep033"
"17201",561,"gonna love this I mean fishing kayaking","ep033"
"17202",564,"this is beautiful I see this like","ep033"
"17203",567,"screened all in I could extend the lanai","ep033"
"17204",570,"out here so it's like one big open","ep033"

"17208",582,"my experience has been with waterfront","ep033"
"17209",585,"homes they always retain their value she","ep033"
"17210",588,"would get dollar for dollar return on","ep033"
"17211",591,"any money she spends upgrading this is","ep033"
"17212",594,"nice not a huge pool but it's a good","ep033"
"17213",597,"size you know tell you what it would","ep033"
"17214",600,"probably cost sixty or seventy thousand","ep033"
"17215",603,"dollars to put a pool really okay fixing","ep033"
"17216",606,"it will be a lot less expensive they go","ep033"
"17217",609,"back inside to look at the enclosed","ep033"
"17218",612,"patio den and a bathroom this thing","ep033"
"17219",615,"could be made into a third bedroom for","ep033"
"17220",618,"4j","ep033"
"17221",621,"yeah it's kind of small I don't know if","ep033"
"17222",624,"Jake's gonna go for this it's small but","ep033"
"17223",627,"I mean when you're living on the water","ep033"
"17224",630,"all you're gonna do is sleep in here","ep033"
"17225",633,"they passed by a bedroom and bathroom","ep033"
"17226",636,"before heading to the master suite this","ep033"
"17227",639,"is the master my furniture won't even","ep033"
"17228",642,"fit in here from my current bedroom","ep033"
"17229",645,"where would I put my clothes where's the","ep033"
"17230",648,"closet it's some space in the master","ep033"
"17231",651,"bathroom that I think can be","ep033"
"17232",654,"incorporated into a walk-in closet","ep033"
"17233",657,"let me put them clothes at your house my","ep033"
"17234",660,"idea is to lose this tub and use this","ep033"
"17235",663,"space as your walk-in closet just so","ep033"
"17236",666,"small to me it's small it needs a lot of","ep033"
"17237",669,"work I'd say every part of this bathroom","ep033"
"17238",672,"would need work but I like the fact that","ep033"
"17239",675,"it's still close to the water and it has","ep033"
"17240",678,"the pool you wanted also have the open","ep033"
"17241",681,"space there's extra three bathrooms but","ep033"
"17242",684,"it just seems like there's just so much","ep033"
"17243",687,"to be done","ep033"
"17244",690,"all house needs work I'm concerned about","ep033"
"17245",693,"you taking on this kind of project at","ep033"
"17246",696,"this stage in your life I think that we","ep033"
"17247",699,"ought to look at something newer that's","ep033"
"17248",702,"move-in-ready I think we could find","ep033"
"17249",705,"something to see the next place is","ep033"
"17250",708,"brand-new and a bit of a stretch for Kim","ep033"
"17251",711,"at the condo kind of worried about that","ep033"
"17252",714,"you know I didn't really want a condo I","ep033"
"17253",717,"think you should keep an open mind","ep033"
"17254",720,"[Applause]","ep033"
"17255",723,"so Jake I just want to remind you that","ep033"
"17256",726,"Gigi's gonna pick you up after school","ep033"

"17260",738,"stay within her 650,000 dollar budget","ep033"
"17261",741,"and beyond the water","ep033"
"17262",744,"Kim is willing to take on a fixer but","ep033"
"17263",747,"close friend Lara think skin would be","ep033"
"17264",750,"better off simplifying her life by","ep033"
"17265",753,"getting a brand-new condo so far","ep033"
"17266",756,"Lara's husband Jean a real-estate agent","ep033"
"17267",759,"has shown them a dated waterfront home","ep033"
"17268",762,"with a pool it was well below her budget","ep033"

"17284",810,"there's maintenance on site and this","ep033"

"17414",1200,"granite that's beautiful","ep033"
"17415",1203,"a lot of contemporary feels in here I","ep033"

"17417",1209,"faucet I mean they don't have an island","ep033"
"17418",1212,"I kind of like an island but this is a","ep033"
"17419",1215,"lot of counter space yeah plenty of room","ep033"
"17420",1218,"to entertain I don't know though I don't","ep033"
"17421",1221,"like this antique white kind of thing","ep033"

"17430",1248,"look at the covered boat dock - that's","ep033"
"17431",1251,"really neat - to have been a little bit","ep033"
"17432",1254,"of a yard back here to play I like that","ep033"
"17433",1257,"I don't see your pool though oh I know","ep033"
"17434",1260,"how much do you think it would be though","ep033"
"17435",1263,"to put a pool here conservative estimate","ep033"
"17436",1266,"$50,000 it might even be more since this","ep033"
"17437",1269,"is on the water and it doesn't look like","ep033"
"17438",1272,"it would be very easy to bring equipment","ep033"
"17439",1275,"in you might even have to bring it in on","ep033"
"17440",1278,"a barge but the boys would so want a","ep033"
"17441",1281,"pool you know so but this is so clean","ep033"
"17442",1284,"and ready to be lived in now maybe they","ep033"
"17443",1287,"could get used to swimming right off the","ep033"
"17444",1290,"dock true they go back inside to look at","ep033"
"17445",1293,"two bedrooms another water view bedroom","ep033"
"17446",1296,"that's nice and a bath before heading to","ep033"
"17447",1299,"the master suite it's nice but it feels","ep033"
"17448",1302,"small and the carpet I'm not a big","ep033"
"17449",1305,"carpet fan we could always fix that","ep033"
"17450",1308,"that's easy","ep033"
"17451",1311,"oh I don't even get the water view the","ep033"
"17452",1314,"boys get the water view I get the front","ep033"
"17453",1317,"yard no I know that's you know about the","ep033"
"17454",1320,"bathroom there's no door there yeah","ep033"
"17455",1323,"could you get a door fee down there it","ep033"
"17456",1326,"looks like it's too small that seems","ep033"
"17457",1329,"weird I'm sure you could do something","ep033"
"17458",1332,"you know although there are some","ep033"
"17459",1335,"compromises to this home in the end you","ep033"
"17460",1338,"get a really nice house that is on the","ep033"
"17461",1341,"water","ep033"
"17462",1344,"oh I know the master suite is not ideal","ep033"
"17463",1347,"but overall this is a really nice house","ep033"
"17464",1350,"it is I loved when we pulled up the curb","ep033"
"17465",1353,"appeal it's my little beach bungalow","ep033"
"17466",1356,"it's on the water I mean the new tile","ep033"
"17467",1359,"floors the plantation shutters granite","ep033"
"17468",1362,"countertops you can tell they put some","ep033"
"17469",1365,"thought into this house the upgrades are","ep033"
"17470",1368,"so impressive and its pristine I think","ep033"
"17471",1371,"the master bedroom I'm really thinking","ep033"
"17472",1374,"about like the no doors in the bathroom","ep033"
"17473",1377,"and it's small but I mean you can't","ep033"
"17474",1380,"really expand that room that is small","ep033"
"17475",1383,"the outdoor living space aside from","ep033"
"17476",1386,"there being a pool is absolutely","ep033"
"17477",1389,"beautiful it is it is but the boys","ep033"
"17478",1392,"really want a pool to put a pool in and","ep033"
"17479",1395,"I'm thinking about the cost and","ep033"
"17480",1398,"everything I'm already over my price","ep033"
"17481",1401,"range well the house has been on the","ep033"
"17482",1404,"market for about six months so there may","ep033"
"17483",1407,"be some flexibility in this price you've","ep033"
"17484",1410,"always put in a lower offer that's true","ep033"
"17485",1413,"making a decision won't be easy for Kim","ep033"
"17486",1416,"she'll have to choose between fixing up","ep033"
"17487",1419,"a waterfront house to be exactly what","ep033"

"18220",405,"I think eventually it would be nice to","ep035"
"18221",408,"just do one flooring throughout since it","ep035"
"18222",411,"is a smaller house and you want to break","ep035"
"18223",414,"it up we know this house is a little bit","ep035"
"18224",417,"older it needs some renovations a lot","ep035"
"18225",420,"like me","ep035"
"18226",423,"a lot of the renovation work that would","ep035"

"18249",492,"brother and dad made my cousin perfect","ep035"
"18250",495,"this needs to go this is really dated","ep035"

"18252",501,"walk-in I don't know it all my clothes","ep035"
"18253",504,"according to dad I don't think so that","ep035"

"18273",564,"little bit of love you know I could see","ep035"
"18274",567,"myself here I am worried though with how","ep035"
"18275",570,"much needs to be renovated I think Dad","ep035"
"18276",573,"would have to move in for like four or","ep035"
"18277",576,"five months to do maybe the next house","ep035"
"18278",579,"we could see something that's a little","ep035"
"18279",582,"bit more renovated but still has that","ep035"
"18280",585,"charm that I'm looking for","ep035"
"18281",588,"okay well look at it okay thanks","ep035"
"18282",591,"unstraight so Marla's lined up a new","ep035"
"18283",594,"construction craftsman but there aren't","ep035"
"18284",597,"established trees very close to the","ep035"
"18285",600,"neighbors remember when I first moved to","ep035"
"18286",603,"Austin I took you here with a strict","ep035"
"18287",606,"280,000 dollar budget for a home in","ep035"
"18288",609,"pricey Austin Texas bridget is hoping","ep035"
"18289",612,"she can rope her dad into doing some","ep035"
"18290",615,"renovations on a budget fixer-upper in","ep035"
"18291",618,"an established neighborhood","ep035"
"18292",621,"[Music]","ep035"
"18293",624,"they've seen a 70s era ranch in her","ep035"
"18294",627,"target area in an older neighborhood","ep035"
"18295",630,"with mature trees near downtown but it","ep035"
"18296",633,"might need more work than dad is willing","ep035"
"18297",636,"to take on and it wasn't a craftsman her","ep035"
"18298",639,"ideal style to find Bridget a craftsman","ep035"
"18299",642,"in her price range her agents taking her","ep035"
"18300",645,"to see a new build 20 minutes from","ep035"
"18301",648,"downtown what you can see we're in a new","ep035"
"18302",651,"construction neighborhood very nearly","ep035"
"18303",654,"new but these homes are beautiful and","ep035"
"18304",657,"they're priced well at 250 1,000 there","ep035"
"18305",660,"aren't established trees though you know","ep035"
"18306",663,"very close to the neighbors but it is a","ep035"
"18307",666,"Craftsman style which I like yeah I like","ep035"
"18308",669,"the stoneware mixed in with siding","ep035"
"18309",672,"that's the one thing about great about","ep035"
"18310",675,"this builder is the homes can not be","ep035"
"18311",678,"exactly the same next to each other but","ep035"
"18312",681,"it's nice for a new bill cuz I don't","ep035"
"18313",684,"like the cookie cutter bridget","ep035"
"18314",687,"definitely has voice she does not want a","ep035"
"18315",690,"new home and so it was a risk bringing","ep035"
"18316",693,"her here and I do feel though that this","ep035"
"18317",696,"home has this great Craftsman style","ep035"
"18318",699,"charm it does fit within her price range","ep035"
"18319",702,"and it's gonna be difficult to find","ep035"
"18320",705,"exactly what she's looking for in that","ep035"
"18321",708,"price range this is a good alternative","ep035"
"18322",711,"and we walk into what could be a dining","ep035"
"18323",714,"room I think it should you had a dining","ep035"
"18324",717,"table I do I have an oval shape so that","ep035"
"18325",720,"would probably fit maybe right here Wow","ep035"
"18326",723,"I like the artist is nice the archways","ep035"
"18327",726,"make it look like it's an older home","ep035"
"18328",729,"what is this flooring so the flooring is","ep035"
"18329",732,"looks like wood but it's actually tile","ep035"
"18330",735,"I'm not sure I want tile I like wood","ep035"
"18331",738,"floor the creaks but its new looks like","ep035"
"18332",741,"wood so let's take a look in the kitchen","ep035"
"18333",744,"I love the white kitchen I do love that","ep035"
"18334",747,"now you like white kitchens it looks a","ep035"
"18335",750,"little new it doesn't have any character","ep035"
"18336",753,"so it would be nice to add some color we","ep035"
"18337",756,"can go shopping for doorknobs I can put","ep035"
"18338",759,"those in all the cabinet stuff would be","ep035"
"18339",762,"easy to do they put great antique stores","ep035"
"18340",765,"here maybe go down to an antique store","ep035"
"18341",768,"and find out some great yeah I like how","ep035"

"18344",777,"fireplace I do love the fireplace","ep035"
"18345",780,"however it seems to take up a lot of the","ep035"
"18346",783,"space in the living room like where","ep035"
"18347",786,"would you put your furniture if you had","ep035"
"18348",789,"barstools there I don't think your","ep035"
"18349",792,"existing couches gone no I don't think","ep035"

"18351",798,"furniture they see the laundry room and","ep035"
"18352",801,"half bath then the first floor master","ep035"
"18353",804,"suite it's a very large bedroom this is","ep035"
"18354",807,"huge","ep035"
"18355",810,"actually I'd rather the space be in the","ep035"
"18356",813,"living room but you know what you can","ep035"
"18357",816,"have a wonderful sitting area in here","ep035"
"18358",819,"and a huge king-size bed it's got a","ep035"
"18359",822,"beautiful windows do you think we could","ep035"
"18360",825,"change out the blades to make them white","ep035"
"18361",828,"so it doesn't stand out so much we can","ep035"

"18369",852,"shower I actually never used a tub so","ep035"

"18555",1410,"new build I saw what I could get for my","ep035"
"18556",1413,"money for the same price I decided it","ep035"
"18557",1416,"would be a smarter decision to go with","ep035"
"18558",1419,"the new build just because I wouldn't","ep035"
"18559",1422,"have to fix anything but because it has","ep035"

"18780",576,"more outdoor space particularly a pool","ep036"
"18781",579,"you know I really wanted a pool but one","ep036"

"18827",717,"2-bedroom 2-bathroom I was hoping for","ep036"
"18828",720,"something a lot nicer no pool no 3rd","ep036"
"18829",723,"bedroom 3 would be quite nice because we","ep036"

"18831",729,"guests it's right on budget at 1,800","ep036"
"18832",732,"that is nice I was picturing more","ep036"
"18833",735,"space to be honest I think bill likes","ep036"

"18835",741,"the light that comes in here I mean with","ep036"
"18836",744,"two skylights and we have this big","ep036"
"18837",747,"window to me it just feels kind of cheap","ep036"
"18838",750,"I just don't see it to me it's not us","ep036"
"18839",753,"Sarah's still umas wants that lifestyle","ep036"
"18840",756,"like she's in enough normal suburb yeah","ep036"

"18844",768,"our list definitely after after seeing","ep036"
"18845",771,"Sarah's reaction to the first house","ep036"
"18846",774,"Bianca and Vera decide to take the hunt","ep036"
"18847",777,"even farther out of the city center","ep036"
"18848",780,"because Sarah is often quite a spacious","ep036"
"18849",783,"unit this is more suitable for her and","ep036"
"18850",786,"Sebastian's needs so we'll try to save","ep036"
"18851",789,"their marriage","ep036"
"18852",792,"Wow look at all the space and trees and","ep036"
"18853",795,"plants and grasses","ep036"
"18854",798,"is there a bride no no okay so we're","ep036"
"18855",801,"looking at a three-bedroom two-bathroom","ep036"
"18856",804,"how far away's is from work yeah so this","ep036"
"18857",807,"one's a bit further you're looking at 25","ep036"
"18858",810,"to 30 minutes depending on traffic","ep036"
"18859",813,"that's not a big deal I mean look at the","ep036"
"18860",816,"space I'm afraid to ask how much it","ep036"
"18861",819,"costs slightly over budget at mm that's","ep036"
"18862",822,"not too bad it's really worth every","ep036"
"18863",825,"painting of it oh wow wow it's very","ep036"
"18864",828,"spacious yeah look at this look at the","ep036"
"18865",831,"fire no so it comes fully finished I","ep036"
"18866",834,"love this furniture I think it's really","ep036"
"18867",837,"classy just looks very well made but one","ep036"
"18868",840,"thing that is on my mind is these tiles","ep036"
"18869",843,"they also don't appear to be super safe","ep036"
"18870",846,"for the baby hmm","ep036"
"18871",849,"yeah he's just learning how to walk so","ep036"
"18872",852,"we have rugs and a girl supply and","ep036"
"18873",855,"wherever budget okay well look at what","ep036"
"18874",858,"we're getting I mean it is not yes a","ep036"
"18875",861,"very beautiful space so far I can see","ep036"
"18876",864,"Bill in his mind calculating all the","ep036"
"18877",867,"extra things we'll need to buy for this","ep036"
"18878",870,"house new stairs don't see me","ep036"
"18879",873,"say yeah you'd have to baby-proof thing","ep036"
"18880",876,"but I think he's got to loosen up on the","ep036"
"18881",879,"budget I really don't think it's a","ep036"
"18882",882,"concern I think it's fine to pay for","ep036"
"18883",885,"these things this is the master bedroom","ep036"
"18884",888,"with the ensuite bathroom yeah this","ep036"
"18885",891,"could definitely work for us it's not a","ep036"
"18886",894,"huge master bedroom but it's I think","ep036"
"18887",897,"plenty of space so this is your guest","ep036"
"18888",900,"bedroom as you call it what size I mean","ep036"
"18889",903,"for the price point so I was expecting","ep036"
"18890",906,"something slightly bigger this room","ep036"
"18891",909,"seems more than adequate to me I think","ep036"
"18892",912,"there are guests left plenty of space","ep036"
"18893",915,"so this is being used as a study but","ep036"
"18894",918,"it'd be Sebastian's paper I love that","ep036"
"18895",921,"there's carpet and the rooms upstairs","ep036"
"18896",924,"it's gonna be great for the baby I don't","ep036"
"18897",927,"have to be so concerned that he might","ep036"
"18898",930,"hurt himself","ep036"
"18899",933,"I see our neighbors have a pool do we","ep036"
"18900",936,"help saw the pool not in this particular","ep036"
"18901",939,"unit now that's kind of a tease yes","ep036"
"18902",942,"cavities overall I love this place","ep036"
"18903",945,"I love the fact that there's three","ep036"
"18904",948,"bedrooms plenty of space for our guests","ep036"
"18905",951,"look at this garden I can really see","ep036"
"18906",954,"myself and Sebastian playing out here","ep036"
"18907",957,"especially when you are traveling","ep036"
"18908",960,"honestly there's nothing I didn't like","ep036"
"18909",963,"except for the fact there wasn't a pool","ep036"
"18910",966,"I just wish it was within budget I mean","ep036"
"18911",969,"we still need to buy you know grill of","ep036"
"18912",972,"rug and it's farther away from from my","ep036"
"18913",975,"office so I'm spending more time in","ep036"
"18914",978,"traffic which is not ideal I know it's","ep036"
"18915",981,"not that much over our budget but we","ep036"
"18916",984,"have to be smart about how we spend our","ep036"
"18917",987,"money we are going down to one income","ep036"
"18918",990,"after all I mean I did give up my career","ep036"
"18919",993,"to come here I made a lot of sacrifice","ep036"
"18920",996,"so hopefully he can we can have some","ep036"
"18921",999,"give-and-take and we can push the budget","ep036"
"18922",1002,"so you're gonna love it is it's under","ep036"
"18923",1005,"budget that's 1,600 oh nice yeah but","ep036"
"18924",1008,"there's no third bedroom yeah I think we","ep036"
"18925",1011,"can make the space work","ep036"
"18926",1014,"[Music]","ep036"
"18927",1017,"we're ready to go cool it's gonna be","ep036"
"18928",1020,"easy easy peasy we got this right good","ep036"
"18929",1023,"time apart from each other is nothing","ep036"
"18930",1026,"new to Bill and Sarah but it'll be very","ep036"
"18931",1029,"different now with a baby","ep036"
"18932",1032,"and in a foreign country we've been","ep036"
"18933",1035,"dying to move abroad so when Bill got a","ep036"
"18934",1038,"good job he said absolutely let's do it","ep036"
"18935",1041,"we're up for an adventure no just a","ep036"
"18936",1044,"crazy relationship I mean together the","ep036"
"18937",1047,"whole time but geographically separate a","ep036"
"18938",1050,"few times he studied abroad in the UK","ep036"
"18939",1053,"when I moved to London he got his job in","ep036"
"18940",1056,"Philly I stayed behind and went in to","ep036"
"18941",1059,"wrap up my job that was just a simple","ep036"
"18942",1062,"maze but we're really lost finally an","ep036"
"18943",1065,"opening","ep036"
"18944",1068,"I mean geographically we've been all","ep036"
"18945",1071,"over the place let's make us a challenge","ep036"
"18946",1074,"how about first one to get out gets to","ep036"
"18947",1077,"choose the house","ep036"
"18948",1080,"ooh high stakes are you ready you're on","ep036"
"18949",1083,"all right ready break there's been","ep036"
"18950",1086,"difficult living you know thousands of","ep036"
"18951",1089,"miles apart in different time zones and","ep036"
"18952",1092,"so we move to Johannesburg really we","ep036"
"18953",1095,"really want to move together and","ep036"
"18954",1098,"especially since that we have a kid I do","ep036"
"18955",1101,"describe this I'm gonna win it's all","ep036"
"18956",1104,"very complicated okay Bill and Sarah's","ep036"
"18957",1107,"house-hunting priorities are not","ep036"
"18958",1110,"matching up Sarah wants space to stretch","ep036"
"18959",1113,"out for herself and baby Sebastian","ep036"
"18960",1116,"I don't really love what I see is there","ep036"
"18961",1119,"a pool unfortunately there's no but a","ep036"
"18962",1122,"third bedroom that's really important to","ep036"
"18963",1125,"me when you close to the city center","ep036"
"18964",1128,"it's small modern at smaller places","ep036"
"18965",1131,"while Bill is feeling the stress of","ep036"
"18966",1134,"having only one income I really like the","ep036"
"18967",1137,"furniture it's very modern I think it","ep036"
"18968",1140,"speaks to us it's slightly over budget","ep036"
"18969",1143,"that's 2,000","ep036"
"18970",1146,"that's not a big deal I mean look at the","ep036"

"19264",357,"she prefers on the west side of the","ep037"
"19265",360,"island close to the beach today's house","ep037"
"19266",363,"is a half duplex which means there's two","ep037"
"19267",366,"different owners on each side obviously","ep037"
"19268",369,"there's no garage with this property","ep037"
"19269",372,"like I know you really wanted but there","ep037"
"19270",375,"is the carport and there is the storage","ep037"
"19271",378,"down here so I think it's a good","ep037"
"19272",381,"compromise this whole half would be ours","ep037"
"19273",384,"and then that is all our neighbor so","ep037"
"19274",387,"like us neighbor correct you go yes","ep037"
"19275",390,"close huh yeah but the good news is it's","ep037"
"19276",393,"6:59 so well below budget then well","ep037"
"19277",396,"below budget six hundred fifty nine","ep037"
"19278",399,"thousand dollars is a great price","ep037"
"19279",402,"because the average price on the island","ep037"
"19280",405,"is about 850,000 Oh","ep037"
"19281",408,"you can see the ocean from our porch","ep037"
"19282",411,"it's kind of a narrow view through","ep037"
"19283",414,"though no it's better than nothing right","ep037"
"19284",417,"by the beach exactly where I wanted to","ep037"
"19285",420,"be I bet you can hear the waves at night","ep037"
"19286",423,"oh I love it","ep037"
"19287",426,"it's so open and airy I like the flow of","ep037"
"19288",429,"the kitchen but it definitely needs new","ep037"
"19289",432,"cabinets it needs new appliances","ep037"
"19290",435,"definitely countertops smaller we cook","ep037"
"19291",438,"and then dining room and then when we're","ep037"
"19292",441,"finished living room I just like it to","ep037"
"19293",444,"be a bit more separated in the living","ep037"
"19294",447,"space but I think it could work for us I","ep037"
"19295",450,"mean it's just the two of us I would","ep037"
"19296",453,"definitely give up space for location i","ep037"
"19297",456,"think proximity to the beach is","ep037"
"19298",459,"something that is number one on my wish","ep037"
"19299",462,"list we can change the inside all we","ep037"
"19300",465,"want but we cannot change where this","ep037"
"19301",468,"house is I love this outdoor patio this","ep037"
"19302",471,"is almost like having another living","ep037"
"19303",474,"room out here isn't it absolutely this","ep037"
"19304",477,"is probably where we'd spend more of our","ep037"
"19305",480,"time now that changes that inside space","ep037"
"19306",483,"we don't need the dining space to be in","ep037"
"19307",486,"there we can have our dining space out","ep037"
"19308",489,"here honey it's a pretty good size out","ep037"
"19309",492,"here and the pool is the pool","ep037"
"19310",495,"non-existent a giant saltwater pool that","ep037"
"19311",498,"is about 500 yards that way yeah the","ep037"
"19312",501,"beach what about some boat dock yeah no","ep037"
"19313",504,"boat dock either honey we'd have to run","ep037"
"19314",507,"a slip at the marina it's a trade-off","ep037"
"19315",510,"we're gonna have to find compromises","ep037"
"19316",513,"somewhere they head back inside to see","ep037"
"19317",516,"the guest bedroom this kid yeah I like","ep037"
"19318",519,"the vaulted ceiling you've got to have a","ep037"
"19319",522,"spare room right because everyone comes","ep037"
"19320",525,"to visit so where do we work good point","ep037"
"19321",528,"I mean we could work in that small room","ep037"
"19322",531,"out the back but then we lost it the","ep037"
"19323",534,"Banyan Sports office though they see the","ep037"
"19324",537,"full bathroom next to the guest bedroom","ep037"
"19325",540,"then head to the master it looks exactly","ep037"
"19326",543,"the same as the yeah it's a mirror that","ep037"
"19327",546,"again right it doesn't feel like a","ep037"
"19328",549,"master bedroom it's not grand has an","ep037"
"19329",552,"ensuite yep well it's very small and","ep037"
"19330",555,"very green it's like 80s fake marble","ep037"
"19331",558,"countertop we definitely would need to","ep037"
"19332",561,"do an entire renovation in here yeah","ep037"
"19333",564,"I think this is the closest we're gonna","ep037"
"19334",567,"get to the beach in our price range it's","ep037"
"19335",570,"kind of small though","ep037"
"19336",573,"you think I think the bedrooms and the","ep037"
"19337",576,"bathrooms are really small I love the","ep037"
"19338",579,"big open-concept living room I love the","ep037"
"19339",582,"outdoor space facing out the back is","ep037"
"19340",585,"good but then we would have to use it as","ep037"
"19341",588,"office space we would no pool no no dog","ep037"
"19342",591,"I think on the island we should be able","ep037"
"19343",594,"to get those things but then we're just","ep037"
"19344",597,"sacrificing where it's gonna be further","ep037"
"19345",600,"away from the beach to get those other","ep037"
"19346",603,"things those are the things I want but","ep037"
"19347",606,"what about what I want now to keep","ep037"
"19348",609,"things happy in the home Elyse has found","ep037"
"19349",612,"a place that she thinks will be perfect","ep037"
"19350",615,"for Richard but this is the house that","ep037"
"19351",618,"is slightly over budget which is how","ep037"
"19352",621,"much cycling around sand falls with my","ep037"
"19353",624,"favorite thing if we move here we can do","ep037"
"19354",627,"this every day Richard and Elise are","ep037"
"19355",630,"looking to move from Orlando to Sanibel","ep037"
"19356",633,"Island on Florida's Gulf Coast we can","ep037"
"19357",636,"cycle to lunch we can cycle to cooking","ep037"
"19358",639,"ice cream ice cream let's go get ice","ep037"
"19359",642,"cream okay now I'll race you with eight","ep037"
"19360",645,"hundred thousand dollars to spend on a","ep037"
"19361",648,"place to live they've seen a half duplex","ep037"
"19362",651,"on the west side of the island that was","ep037"
"19363",654,"just steps from the beach exactly what","ep037"
"19364",657,"Elise wants but it didn't have a pool or","ep037"
"19365",660,"a boat dock for Richard","ep037"
"19366",663,"so now Elise who's a real estate agent","ep037"
"19367",666,"has picked out a house on the east side","ep037"
"19368",669,"of the island that she hopes Richard","ep037"
"19369",672,"will like oh this is beautiful","ep037"
"19370",675,"so this is the house that is slightly","ep037"
"19371",678,"over budget which is how much eight","ep037"
"19372",681,"hundred and ninety nine thousand that's","ep037"
"19373",684,"not slightly over budget well look at","ep037"
"19374",687,"how cute it is it's not contemporary so","ep037"
"19375",690,"it's not my style at all but it's","ep037"
"19376",693,"totally exactly what you are like it is","ep037"
"19377",696,"exactly what I'm looking for where's the","ep037"
"19378",699,"garage there's no garage so I think that","ep037"
"19379",702,"if we were to buy this house it would","ep037"
"19380",705,"definitely be a challenge to put all of","ep037"
"19381",708,"our outdoor items somewhere okyou","ep037"
"19382",711,"entryway nice it's got some storage here","ep037"
"19383",714,"oh my goodness this is gorgeous the","ep037"
"19384",717,"ceilings are so tall this is beautiful","ep037"
"19385",720,"so this would be the main living room","ep037"
"19386",723,"right yes what is that it's like shells","ep037"
"19387",726,"like shells which is perfect for Santa","ep037"
"19388",729,"Bell okay so what's this over here then","ep037"
"19389",732,"this would be dining room I guess at","ep037"
"19390",735,"least likes the open concept of this","ep037"
"19391",738,"kind of house I'm not so sure for me I","ep037"
"19392",741,"like the rooms to be more separated and","ep037"
"19393",744,"more distinct I love the open feel of","ep037"
"19394",747,"this kitchen but I am NOT the biggest","ep037"
"19395",750,"fan of the retro style I love the retro","ep037"
"19396",753,"style I love the work surfaces it feels","ep037"
"19397",756,"like it's a table at a 1950s diner what","ep037"
"19398",759,"do you think do you think we could put","ep037"
"19399",762,"maybe put in marble countertops no I","ep037"
"19400",765,"like these you're talking about invested","ep037"
"19401",768,"in new countertops on a house that's","ep037"
"19402",771,"over budget well then what's a couple","ep037"
"19403",774,"thousand dollars on marble on top that's","ep037"
"19404",777,"not happening they see a full bathroom","ep037"
"19405",780,"off the kitchen this is charming and two","ep037"
"19406",783,"bedrooms one of which they could use as","ep037"
"19407",786,"an office but the next room is a bit of","ep037"
"19408",789,"a mystery there's a bathroom right here","ep037"
"19409",792,"but the bathrooms like double doors","ep037"
"19410",795,"opens onto it but I like here I mean the","ep037"
"19411",798,"tiles are nice yeah so what's through","ep037"

"19416",813,"middle of the house yes oh this is huge","ep037"
"19417",816,"it here I'm so glad this is the master","ep037"
"19418",819,"and not that out there the views I mean","ep037"
"19419",822,"it's very tropical in green but like I","ep037"
"19420",825,"would rather be looking out at the ocean","ep037"
"19421",828,"and being able to hear the waves while","ep037"
"19422",831,"we're late I'm sure you would but you'd","ep037"
"19423",834,"be laying hill hearing the waves coming","ep037"
"19424",837,"up going another million another minute","ep037"
"19425",840,"that's what they'll do through to the","ep037"
"19426",843,"definitely the master bathroom master","ep037"
"19427",846,"bathroom this marble is here finally I","ep037"
"19428",849,"get like a two-by-two section that's not","ep037"
"19429",852,"yet what do you think of this this is","ep037"
"19430",855,"really cute it's really cute no space","ep037"
"19431",858,"there's no counter space there's no","ep037"
"19432",861,"storage space we'd be to change it out","ep037"
"19433",864,"for something more functional where does","ep037"
"19434",867,"that come from if we've already","ep037"
"19435",870,"overspent we will make it work","ep037"
"19436",873,"we'll make you mad okay they head out","ep037"

"19448",909,"intercoastal okay I'm happy it's","ep037"
"19449",912,"definitely not my style and especially","ep037"
"19450",915,"like the kitchen I think the outside of","ep037"
"19451",918,"the house on the curb appeal is just","ep037"
"19452",921,"fantastic yeah yeah this is eight","ep037"
"19453",924,"hundred and ninety nine thousand dollars","ep037"
"19454",927,"and we have no real storage for this","ep037"
"19455",930,"house I mean there's not even a storage","ep037"
"19456",933,"shed in the backyard","ep037"
"19457",936,"we're not as near to the beach as you'd","ep037"
"19458",939,"like to be that is very true so I'd","ep037"
"19459",942,"really maybe like to go see something a","ep037"
"19460",945,"little bit closer to the sands okay so","ep037"
"19461",948,"now she's found a place that's just a","ep037"
"19462",951,"3-minute walk from the beach","ep037"
"19463",954,"not only do you get the beach but you","ep037"
"19464",957,"get some exercise on the way there uh","ep037"

"19470",975,"a budget of $800,000 for a house on","ep037"
"19471",978,"Sanibel Island in Florida he's hoping","ep037"
"19472",981,"for a place on a canal with a boat dock","ep037"
"19473",984,"in the back but she wants to be as close","ep037"
"19474",987,"to the beach as she can get we looked a","ep037"
"19475",990,"little bit small for this boat slip","ep037"
"19476",993,"don't you think Oh it'll be fine so far","ep037"
"19477",996,"they've seen a half duplex that's close","ep037"
"19478",999,"enough to the beach to hear the waves","ep037"
"19479",1002,"but it didn't have a boat dock or the","ep037"
"19480",1005,"pool that Richard wants then they saw a","ep037"
"19481",1008,"house on a canal with a boat dock and a","ep037"
"19482",1011,"pool but it wasn't close to the beach","ep037"
"19483",1014,"plus it was over their budget so now","ep037"
"19484",1017,"she's lined up another option for them","ep037"
"19485",1020,"to see this is more the kind of thing I","ep037"
"19486",1023,"was thinking yeah it's a lot more","ep037"
"19487",1026,"traditional for you I knew you'd like it","ep037"
"19488",1029,"I think it's a little plain I just feel","ep037"
"19489",1032,"like it's lacking character the garage","ep037"
"19490",1035,"space is really nice Josh it's nice so","ep037"
"19491",1038,"it's three bedrooms two bathrooms on the","ep037"
"19492",1041,"market for six hundred and eighty nine","ep037"
"19493",1044,"thousand dollars Wow","ep037"
"19494",1047,"that seems really raised well for this","ep037"
"19495",1050,"the best thing is we're about three","ep037"
"19496",1053,"minute walk to the beach Oh three","ep037"
"19497",1056,"minutes is good yeah so we're just","ep037"

"19722",141,"consolidated rooms within six months now","ep038"
"19723",144,"married they live in downtown Tampa and","ep038"
"19724",147,"have really enjoyed watching the area","ep038"
"19725",150,"gain new life when we first moved here I","ep038"
"19726",153,"knew that there's a urban renewal","ep038"
"19727",156,"process going on and it was literally","ep038"
"19728",159,"being torn up and rebuild and it's","ep038"
"19729",162,"really developed a lot the Riverwalk has","ep038"
"19730",165,"played a really important part and it's","ep038"
"19731",168,"just been really great to see the whole","ep038"
"19732",171,"thing develop yeah you could say that","ep038"

"19738",189,"something bigger than their current","ep038"
"19739",192,"two-bedroom condo I think that we both","ep038"
"19740",195,"agree that we need at least three","ep038"
"19741",198,"bedrooms now but I think the hard part","ep038"
"19742",201,"is that he wants to stay in the urban","ep038"
"19743",204,"environment but I'm ready to actually","ep038"
"19744",207,"get outside of the urban environment and","ep038"
"19745",210,"have a little bit more quiet","ep038"
"19746",213,"I've been living in an urban condo for","ep038"
"19747",216,"at least nine years you know that it's","ep038"
"19748",219,"really part of my life and lifestyle and","ep038"
"19749",222,"so I'm used to very loud busy walking","ep038"
"19750",225,"places and so you know I want to remain","ep038"
"19751",228,"in the urban environment","ep038"
"19752",231,"I definitely like a more modern condo","ep038"
"19753",234,"high-rise I like things that are low","ep038"
"19754",237,"maintenance and that are sleek smooth","ep038"
"19755",240,"I'm kind of in the nesting mode so if I","ep038"
"19756",243,"were all by myself buying this house","ep038"
"19757",246,"then I would go straight to a bungalow","ep038"
"19758",249,"an older house when it would be very","ep038"
"19759",252,"cute and charming my dream home would","ep038"
"19760",255,"have a porch I can really see ourselves","ep038"
"19761",258,"sitting out on the porch and watching","ep038"
"19762",261,"our kids grow what do you want me to","ep038"
"19763",264,"make for dinner tonight some of that","ep038"
"19764",267,"organic quinoa pasta sounds good okay","ep038"
"19765",270,"how about some homemade spaghetti yeah","ep038"
"19766",273,"and we can get fresh garlic for in the","ep038"
"19767",276,"marinara sauce I spend most of my time","ep038"
"19768",279,"in the kitchen I prepare all of our food","ep038"
"19769",282,"from scratch so I need a nice big","ep038"
"19770",285,"kitchen","ep038"
"19771",288,"a nice big workspace and with a lot of","ep038"
"19772",291,"storage they both agree on a big master","ep038"
"19773",294,"with space to put a crib a fireplace and","ep038"
"19774",297,"a large dining room","ep038"
"19775",300,"something with tons of natural light is","ep038"
"19776",303,"also a must it's an important part for","ep038"
"19777",306,"me because in the hospital you don't","ep038"
"19778",309,"really get to see the daylight a lot and","ep038"
"19779",312,"so when I come home I want that you know","ep038"
"19780",315,"sunlight and that natural light and","ep038"
"19781",318,"speaking of sunlight Michelle insists on","ep038"
"19782",321,"a private place to sunbathe if we do get","ep038"
"19783",324,"a house we won't have to share the","ep038"
"19784",327,"sunbathing deck I won't have to fight","ep038"
"19785",330,"anyone for a lounge chair I think you","ep038"
"19786",333,"also want a space for a girl I","ep038"
"19787",336,"absolutely love drilling so that's","ep038"
"19788",339,"important to me we don't want to go over","ep038"
"19789",342,"475 for our budget I think that we'll be","ep038"
"19790",345,"able to get a lot more for our money if","ep038"
"19791",348,"we move outside of downtown I'm hoping","ep038"
"19792",351,"that if we look hard enough that maybe","ep038"
"19793",354,"we'll be able to find something we're","ep038"
"19794",357,"net even with the child that we can have","ep038"
"19795",360,"enough space to remain in the urban","ep038"
"19796",363,"environment","ep038"
"19797",366,"first up they head out to see a home","ep038"
"19798",369,"about ten minutes north of downtown","ep038"
"19799",372,"Tampa hey Nicole","ep038"
"19800",375,"how's it going it's going good what do","ep038"
"19801",378,"you think of the neighborhood I love the","ep038"
"19802",381,"neighborhood and love the street yeah","ep038"
"19803",384,"yeah it's really pretty isn't it yeah","ep038"
"19804",387,"we're in some Hill Heights today which","ep038"
"19805",390,"is one of Tampa's earliest suburbs yeah","ep038"
"19806",393,"you know how I feel about some of us","ep038"
"19807",396,"this house is about 2,100 square feet","ep038"
"19808",399,"and it's listed for 400,000 which is a","ep038"
"19809",402,"really great price for that much space","ep038"
"19810",405,"mm-hmm","ep038"
"19811",408,"can I see that there are two porches yes","ep038"
"19812",411,"so this house was probably originally","ep038"
"19813",414,"built in 1925 as a single storey","ep038"
"19814",417,"bungalow at some point they did an","ep038"
"19815",420,"addition so now you have upstairs and a","ep038"
"19816",423,"downstairs front porch this is exactly","ep038"
"19817",426,"what I had envisioned when I had front","ep038"
"19818",429,"porch in mind yeah it's really pretty","ep038"
"19819",432,"isn't it yeah come on in","ep038"
"19820",435,"this must be the living room it is what","ep038"
"19821",438,"do you think the light is good yes","ep038"
"19822",441,"is that a functioning fireplace it is","ep038"
"19823",444,"that's a wood-burning fireplace okay and","ep038"
"19824",447,"there's lots of original detail in this","ep038"
"19825",450,"living room I really like that it's cozy","ep038"
"19826",453,"good I'm glad you like it you've got a","ep038"
"19827",456,"dining room area over here mm-hmm","ep038"
"19828",459,"that seems a little small I'm not sure","ep038"
"19829",462,"if I were table would fit in here yeah","ep038"
"19830",465,"this just seems pretty tight there's","ep038"
"19831",468,"like kind of a lack of a flow through","ep038"
"19832",471,"with this define wall","ep038"
"19833",474,"I don't know how functional this space","ep038"
"19834",477,"is for us with a growing family you do","ep038"
"19835",480,"have a large kitchen over here mm-hmm","ep038"
"19836",483,"not sure about these floors it's unusual","ep038"
"19837",486,"isn't it brick","ep038"
"19838",489,"this was probably a porch at one point","ep038"
"19839",492,"so it's got a nice herringbone pattern","ep038"
"19840",495,"in it now but there's definitely a","ep038"
"19841",498,"farmhouse take in this kitchen which is","ep038"
"19842",501,"in style right now I could see myself","ep038"
"19843",504,"cooking and baking in here okay","ep038"
"19844",507,"you've also got two bedrooms on the","ep038"
"19845",510,"first floor oh they're right this way","ep038"
"19846",513,"okay they take a look at the downstairs","ep038"

"19892",651,"concerned that the floors are really","ep038"
"19893",654,"slanted although it has charm it's kind","ep038"
"19894",657,"of old and I'm worried about maintenance","ep038"
"19895",660,"on this place so they head out to take a","ep038"
"19896",663,"look at something more modern for Arnold","ep038"

"19898",669,"no three bedrooms available in your","ep038"
"19899",672,"price range in downtown Tampa","ep038"
"19900",675,"[Music]","ep038"

"19907",696,"well priced bungalow in a historic","ep038"
"19908",699,"neighborhood perfect for Michelle but","ep038"
"19909",702,"Arnold has his heart set on a home","ep038"
"19910",705,"that's more modern and in an urban area","ep038"
"19911",708,"so now their agents lined up a place she","ep038"
"19912",711,"thinks Arnold will like okay and even","ep038"
"19913",714,"though he prefers staying in Tampa their","ep038"
"19914",717,"agent thinks another location will work","ep038"
"19915",720,"what's the address","ep038"
"19916",723,"it's eight one North in fact she's","ep038"
"19917",726,"sending them out to nearby st. Pete so","ep038"
"19918",729,"she thinks it could work as well","ep038"
"19919",732,"balut is being calculated all right","ep038"
"19920",735,"[Music]","ep038"
"19921",738,"hey guys how's it going Noah nice hi","ep038"
"19922",741,"yeah you like it the only thing is it's","ep038"

"19924",747,"well I hate to tell you this Arnold but","ep038"
"19925",750,"there are actually no three bedrooms","ep038"
"19926",753,"available in your price range","ep038"
"19927",756,"in downtown Tampa three bedroom condos","ep038"
"19928",759,"and Tampa are a rarity so they really","ep038"
"19929",762,"come at a premium you can spend as much","ep038"
"19930",765,"as a million or a million point two on a","ep038"
"19931",768,"three bedroom downtown st. Pete still","ep038"
"19932",771,"has that urban feel for them and it's","ep038"
"19933",774,"really our sister city it's only about","ep038"
"19934",777,"20 or 30 minutes away today we're gonna","ep038"
"19935",780,"look at the townhouse I think one of the","ep038"
"19936",783,"reasons you might like it is it's good","ep038"
"19937",786,"compromise between a condo and a house","ep038"
"19938",789,"and you still have that city living","ep038"
"19939",792,"I do like it's modern what you obviously","ep038"
"19940",795,"know highlight might be a little might","ep038"
"19941",798,"be a little too modern all right well","ep038"
"19942",801,"this is three bedrooms three and a half","ep038"
"19943",804,"baths and it's listed for 490 although","ep038"
"19944",807,"this is a little over their budget this","ep038"
"19945",810,"house is brand-new and walking distance","ep038"
"19946",813,"to downtown I think it's worth it just","ep038"
"19947",816,"inside the door they look in on a first","ep038"
"19948",819,"floor guest suite before heading up to","ep038"
"19949",822,"the second floor living area Wow look at","ep038"
"19950",825,"this kitchen it's huge yeah you've got","ep038"
"19951",828,"lots of counter space in this kitchen I","ep038"
"19952",831,"yeah I would agree I like it there's a","ep038"
"19953",834,"lot of space here I could definitely see","ep038"
"19954",837,"myself cooking and baking here yeah I","ep038"
"19955",840,"could see you making a mess in here too","ep038"
"19956",843,"with all the flour and baking okay seems","ep038"
"19957",846,"a little small to me but I do like that","ep038"
"19958",849,"it opens up to the window into the","ep038"
"19959",852,"living room and so there's a nice flow","ep038"
"19960",855,"really like these tall windows let's end","ep038"
"19961",858,"a lot of light one of the nice things is","ep038"
"19962",861,"that you have these nice high 10-foot","ep038"
"19963",864,"ceilings it bounces around a lot of","ep038"
"19964",867,"light but the home doesn't have a","ep038"
"19965",870,"fireplace you know this is a lovely","ep038"
"19966",873,"space it's just there's really not a","ep038"
"19967",876,"little whole lot of charm it's not","ep038"
"19968",879,"really my style oh well you know how I","ep038"
"19969",882,"feel I like the modern and I like the","ep038"
"19970",885,"open space so I know it has to be a","ep038"
"19971",888,"balance of opinions though they head up","ep038"
"19972",891,"another flight of stairs to the third","ep038"
"19973",894,"floor they peek in on a bed and bath","ep038"
"19974",897,"before making their way to the master","ep038"
"19975",900,"suite yeah you've got a huge window here","ep038"
"19976",903,"it is pretty bright mm-hmm it's a little","ep038"
"19977",906,"small the master suite just","ep038"
"19978",909,"doesn't seem big enough for us I was","ep038"
"19979",912,"really hoping to be able to keep the","ep038"
"19980",915,"baby in the crib in the room for at","ep038"
"19981",918,"least the first few months I really like","ep038"
"19982",921,"the shower it's nice and big and there's","ep038"
"19983",924,"a clear glass door which I couldn't like","ep038"
"19984",927,"it was pretty big but I like I don't","ep038"
"19985",930,"like yeah but it's got the nice white","ep038"

"19991",948,"nice I love it yes that's beautiful I","ep038"
"19992",951,"can see the skyline so although it's not","ep038"
"19993",954,"Tampa it's walking distance from so many","ep038"
"19994",957,"things it's not quite the view we have","ep038"
"19995",960,"downtown but it has an urban feel and","ep038"
"19996",963,"has an urban view and if it means I can","ep038"
"19997",966,"maintain the urban lifestyle I'm willing","ep038"
"19998",969,"to take that view I can for sure see","ep038"

"20142",1401,"no space for sunbathing and the slanted","ep038"
"20143",1404,"floors are a little concerning I think","ep038"

"20953",705,"it's too new in my mind for my style","ep040"
"20954",708,"because it just looks like every other","ep040"
"20955",711,"model home made in the last five years","ep040"
"20956",714,"this hits every single mark that I was","ep040"
"20957",717,"looking for this open concept is perfect","ep040"
"20958",720,"like a TV space might be a little","ep040"
"20959",723,"difficult because I'm not seeing a wall","ep040"
"20960",726,"where you could actually create cuz you","ep040"
"20961",729,"wouldn't rather mess up the brick and I","ep040"

"20967",747,"different color than the rest of","ep040"
"20968",750,"cabinets yeah that is weird","ep040"
"20969",753,"but but but but it's an island and it's","ep040"

"20981",789,"love it this flooring is all the way","ep040"
"20982",792,"through they see two bedrooms one could","ep040"
"20983",795,"be her office the other could house his","ep040"
"20984",798,"collectibles then it's on to the master","ep040"
"20985",801,"oh wow yeah this is a good-size French","ep040"
"20986",804,"doors this is awesome","ep040"
"20987",807,"is that your closet it has a door oh","ep040"
"20988",810,"it's a hole","ep040"
"20989",813,"it's teeny teeny teeny tiny you know my","ep040"
"20990",816,"guess is is that because it is a 1960s","ep040"
"20991",819,"home that this was an afterthought and","ep040"
"20992",822,"it looks like it was probably put","ep040"
"20993",825,"together later on yeah it is by","ep040"
"20994",828,"definition walking it is they check out","ep040"
"20995",831,"the master bath oh yeah this is girl","ep040"

"20999",843,"have much character the fence is kind of","ep040"
"21000",846,"low but it is fully fenced no it is not","ep040"
"21001",849,"fully fenced over there is an RV pad","ep040"
"21002",852,"okay so you need to add a defense there","ep040"
"21003",855,"they move on to the mother-in-law","ep040"
"21004",858,"basement okay this is a mini-fridge kind","ep040"
"21005",861,"of like this house times two it looks","ep040"
"21006",864,"similar upstairs those downstairs so","ep040"
"21007",867,"this is another wood-burning fireplace","ep040"
"21008",870,"down here love this using the downstairs","ep040"
"21009",873,"for entertaining seems like an ideal","ep040"
"21010",876,"solution because then you wouldn't have","ep040"
"21011",879,"to worry about where to put the TV","ep040"
"21012",882,"upstairs see Jimmy this seems like","ep040"
"21013",885,"wasted space I don't know why a house","ep040"
"21014",888,"needs two kitchens well look there's the","ep040"
"21015",891,"third bathroom then yes","ep040"
"21016",894,"okay so then there's more yep they see","ep040"
"21017",897,"two more bedrooms the thing we have to","ep040"
"21018",900,"think about though is would we really","ep040"
"21019",903,"use this space it's a huge house it's","ep040"
"21020",906,"almost like like I said it's a house","ep040"
"21021",909,"times two","ep040"
"21022",912,"everything is consistent everything is","ep040"
"21023",915,"brand-new you hit it absolutely on the","ep040"
"21024",918,"head with this but never wrong the","ep040"
"21025",921,"problem is it's too matchy-matchy and to","ep040"
"21026",924,"me it's too sterile I mean all the rooms","ep040"
"21027",927,"look the same there's no uniqueness to","ep040"
"21028",930,"them about the contemporary is that it","ep040"
"21029",933,"is all bad shape so but we are at the","ep040"
"21030",936,"very top of our budget sure but the nice","ep040"
"21031",939,"part is there's not a single reason it","ep040"
"21032",942,"is a turnkey home other than to the","ep040"
"21033",945,"fence yard yeah yeah the dog right away","ep040"

"21044",978,"split-level with some of the craftsman","ep040"
"21045",981,"touches Steve likes and a 1960s brick","ep040"
"21046",984,"with Natalie's open concept but it also","ep040"
"21047",987,"had small closets and lots of extra","ep040"
"21048",990,"space they're not sure what to do with","ep040"

"21055",1011,"has a problem with it because it's not","ep040"
"21056",1014,"new like she always wants I don't see a","ep040"
"21057",1017,"garage you know what the garage is","ep040"
"21058",1020,"around back it's a detached two-car and","ep040"
"21059",1023,"it's fully fenced and the best part","ep040"
"21060",1026,"about this this is under budget for you","ep040"
"21061",1029,"guys it is 326 okay yeah I can promise","ep040"
"21062",1032,"to keep an open mind let's check it out","ep040"
"21063",1035,"okay","ep040"
"21064",1038,"all right oh yeah this is nice I like","ep040"
"21065",1041,"that that's really cool that's","ep040"
"21066",1044,"interesting well what do you deal with","ep040"
"21067",1047,"that it looks like you could use this as","ep040"
"21068",1050,"a sitting area you could use it for TV","ep040"
"21069",1053,"you can stick a TV in there sitting area","ep040"
"21070",1056,"for the cats maybe yeah if I sit on that","ep040"
"21071",1059,"I'm not getting back up the hardwoods","ep040"
"21072",1062,"are really nice though it looks like","ep040"
"21073",1065,"real hurt yeah it's original hardwood","ep040"
"21074",1068,"I'm a little confused by this room it","ep040"
"21075",1071,"doesn't connect anything it's not the","ep040"
"21076",1074,"open concept that I like actually I","ep040"
"21077",1077,"think this is probably the only space in","ep040"
"21078",1080,"this upstairs area that's for","ep040"
"21079",1083,"entertaining so you'd have to decide","ep040"
"21080",1086,"what you would use this room for home","ep040"
"21081",1089,"maybe we can knock the wall down","ep040"
"21082",1092,"oh now if I can blow that wall out it's","ep040"
"21083",1095,"good to go and look at the dining space","ep040"
"21084",1098,"the dining space is great it's a good","ep040"
"21085",1101,"sized eating area for two people even","ep040"
"21086",1104,"though it may be a small space with the","ep040"
"21087",1107,"windows maybe it doesn't feel as small","ep040"
"21088",1110,"then what do you think yeah I like it","ep040"
"21089",1113,"cuz it's got like four windows in here","ep040"
"21090",1116,"that's nice yeah the kitchen itself is","ep040"
"21091",1119,"perfect it just definitely doesn't have","ep040"
"21092",1122,"that open concept and agreed they see","ep040"
"21093",1125,"the backyard","ep040"
"21094",1128,"like this yeah this is a good-sized","ep040"
"21095",1131,"space I like the fire pit how it's built","ep040"
"21096",1134,"in that is pretty neat and two bedrooms","ep040"
"21097",1137,"okay this is a stair this could either","ep040"
"21098",1140,"be the you know master or this could be","ep040"
"21099",1143,"just the guest room the closet that's","ep040"
"21100",1146,"not a walk-in then they see a full bath","ep040"
"21101",1149,"before heading to the basement","ep040"
"21102",1152,"I like that fireplace all brick then I","ep040"
"21103",1155,"do like the mantel yeah can't really I","ep040"
"21104",1158,"guess you could do a couch against the","ep040"
"21105",1161,"wall here I mean yeah it is really you","ep040"
"21106",1164,"can put one back here though so this","ep040"
"21107",1167,"could be used as a master over actually","ep040"
"21108",1170,"I guess I could use this as my","ep040"
"21109",1173,"collectible room let's look at the","ep040"
"21110",1176,"bathroom","ep040"
"21111",1179,"whoa what is happening in here this is","ep040"
"21112",1182,"the closet this is a walk-in closet Gale","ep040"
"21113",1185,"scratch my collectible room this is a","ep040"
"21114",1188,"proper walk-in closet I love this I love","ep040"
"21115",1191,"this I love this so then we have to have","ep040"
"21116",1194,"the conversation about guest room versus","ep040"
"21117",1197,"collectible room because we're down to","ep040"
"21118",1200,"three bedrooms yeah but I think we","ep040"
"21119",1203,"couldn't have a collectible room in this","ep040"
"21120",1206,"house at all it would have to be the","ep040"
"21121",1209,"garage too small you know we'd have the","ep040"
"21122",1212,"guest room and then the master would be","ep040"
"21123",1215,"down here and we could both be in that","ep040"
"21124",1218,"closet that's what I really like it","ep040"
"21125",1221,"always I don't think so","ep040"
"21126",1224,"I love the brick the hardwood floors are","ep040"
"21127",1227,"really awesome I love that they're","ep040"
"21128",1230,"original and that's really important to","ep040"
"21129",1233,"me and I love the age of the home but","ep040"
"21130",1236,"the rooms are a little bit small and","ep040"
"21131",1239,"there's no collectible room for me I","ep040"
"21132",1242,"mean I think the home is a really nice","ep040"
"21133",1245,"feel to it the open concept is a huge","ep040"
"21134",1248,"mess for me so that downstairs with the","ep040"
"21135",1251,"walk-in closet is everything and love it","ep040"
"21136",1254,"if they can't both get everything they","ep040"
"21137",1257,"want they'll have to compromise and it","ep040"
"21138",1260,"may come down to an open concept versus","ep040"
"21139",1263,"character okay so maybe we just say","ep040"
"21140",1266,"which one we're thinking Steve and","ep040"
"21141",1269,"Natalie have a max budget of three","ep040"
"21142",1272,"hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a","ep040"
"21143",1275,"new home in Salt Lake City Utah their","ep040"
"21144",1278,"agents showed them several options and","ep040"
"21145",1281,"now it's time to decide first was a 1980","ep040"
"21146",1284,"split-level with a cottage bungalow look","ep040"
"21147",1287,"that was 3:13 I did like that that house","ep040"
"21148",1290,"had an office for you and a collectible","ep040"
"21149",1293,"room for me the backyard was great yeah","ep040"
"21150",1296,"and it did have the wood-burning","ep040"
"21151",1299,"fireplace yeah and the gas stove and it","ep040"
"21152",1302,"had the fake hardwood floors the house","ep040"
"21153",1305,"of floors and then we have the one I","ep040"
"21154",1308,"love the Rambler ranch-style that was","ep040"
"21155",1311,"three hundred fifty thousand it did have","ep040"
"21156",1314,"that open concept that I absolutely","ep040"
"21157",1317,"loved but it was just so sterile the","ep040"
"21158",1320,"house is built in 1965 but on the inside","ep040"
"21159",1323,"it just looked like every other model","ep040"
"21160",1326,"home on the planet they did have an","ep040"
"21161",1329,"electric stove and football Sunday you","ep040"
"21162",1332,"know how important that is","ep040"
"21163",1335,"yeah it seems like that house wasn't","ep040"
"21164",1338,"made for a TV upstairs but tons of room","ep040"
"21165",1341,"for one in the basement yeah but it","ep040"
"21166",1344,"wasn't the highest price point that we","ep040"
"21167",1347,"have so let's talk about the brick home","ep040"
"21168",1350,"326,000 it has a little bit of the carp","ep040"
"21169",1353,"mentalize flow yeah it means that first","ep040"
"21170",1356,"room it was just that room right but I","ep040"
"21171",1359,"think we have potential there I mean if","ep040"
"21172",1362,"we were able to maybe look at opening up","ep040"
"21173",1365,"that space and it had the gas stove had","ep040"
"21174",1368,"a wood-burning fireplace I had a walk-in","ep040"
"21175",1371,"closet","ep040"
"21176",1374,"and it did like that brick style of home","ep040"
"21177",1377,"better than the rest okay so maybe we","ep040"
"21178",1380,"just say which one we're thinking I like","ep040"
"21179",1383,"the cottage bungalow it checked off the","ep040"
"21180",1386,"most of the boxes it's like under our","ep040"
"21181",1389,"budget and we can have more room to do","ep040"
"21182",1392,"different things to it okay well this","ep040"
"21183",1395,"may not be something I say often ever in","ep040"
"21184",1398,"our relationship but I think you're","ep040"
"21185",1401,"right","ep040"
"21186",1404,"[Laughter]","ep040"
"21187",1407,"we're gonna have to teach him not to","ep040"
"21188",1410,"take those sticks from our wood file","ep040"
"21189",1413,"we're very happy to be here we've been","ep040"
"21190",1416,"in the home for two weeks the house is","ep040"
"21191",1419,"priced at 3:13 and we ended up paying","ep040"
"21192",1422,"314 because there was a little bit of a","ep040"
"21193",1425,"bidding war for it maybe we could have","ep040"
"21194",1428,"like monthly movie nights or something","ep040"
"21195",1431,"I'm still struggling a little bit with","ep040"
"21196",1434,"the fact that this home doesn't hit my","ep040"
"21197",1437,"contemporary open concept I still have","ep040"
"21198",1440,"this idea of knocking out some of the","ep040"
"21199",1443,"space between the kitchen and the front","ep040"
"21200",1446,"living room but at the same time having","ep040"
"21201",1449,"it downstairs for football Sunday is","ep040"
"21202",1452,"really really nice and my collectible","ep040"
"21203",1455,"room is coming along great I'm still in","ep040"
"21204",1458,"the process of setting it up something","ep040"

"21211",1479,"have it so that it's large enough for","ep040"
"21212",1482,"both of us which might not be","ep040"
"21213",1485,"so you're gonna garden it is absolutely","ep040"

"21331",348,"home with colonial touches for honor it","ep041"

"21350",405,"checkbooks here in Cincinnati","ep041"
"21351",408,"it is a seller's market so when you're","ep041"

"21359",432,"it's someone over there but we're gonna","ep041"
"21360",435,"have to break down that wall in order to","ep041"
"21361",438,"see the kitchen it's something we can","ep041"
"21362",441,"consider I think this flow works well","ep041"
"21363",444,"though that window I'm really loving","ep041"
"21364",447,"that I mean can you imagine having","ep041"
"21365",450,"family dinners here one thing I don't","ep041"
"21366",453,"like is that it doesn't have hardwood","ep041"
"21367",456,"floors throughout I know and I think","ep041"
"21368",459,"that something would have to definitely","ep041"
"21369",462,"change I'm hearing project I'm hearing","ep041"
"21370",465,"money things I don't want to see but you","ep041"

"21380",495,"know why jack is so worked up about it","ep041"
"21381",498,"this house is under budget and I feel","ep041"
"21382",501,"like we can still do the renovation and","ep041"

"21385",510,"want a house that's ready to move in the","ep041"
"21386",513,"thing for me is that it doesn't have the","ep041"
"21387",516,"gas cooktop and then that's a","ep041"

"21637",1266,"it's a colonial the symmetry of the","ep041"
"21638",1269,"rooms on the first floor really appealed","ep041"
"21639",1272,"to me I love the backyard","ep041"
"21640",1275,"oh I could see us spending a lot of time","ep041"

"21657",1326,"the entire house the stairwell was a","ep041"
"21658",1329,"little off to the side but it is to the","ep041"
"21659",1332,"front so that's a little bit of concern","ep041"
"21660",1335,"the address also doesn't have an 8 in","ep041"
"21661",1338,"there at the very least it hasn't even","ep041"
"21662",1341,"number that we can make work even though","ep041"

"21664",1347,"which is right along the lines of my","ep041"
"21665",1350,"fresh hold there right but it still had","ep041"
"21666",1353,"a littering that I was looking for but","ep041"
"21667",1356,"then you didn't have a guest still kept","ep041"
"21668",1359,"so that would be an expensive addition","ep041"
"21669",1362,"what do you think of the white brick","ep041"
"21670",1365,"traditional I really loved the charm","ep041"
"21671",1368,"that staircase was so beautifully done","ep041"

"21679",1392,"it was way past the 50 year mark for me","ep041"
"21680",1395,"and it just kind of felt a little creepy","ep041"
"21681",1398,"and it's priced over a budget at 5:05 so","ep041"
"21682",1401,"what about the colonial house I love","ep041"
"21683",1404,"that it was a colonial affinely it's","ep041"

"21985",783,"a lot of rain it dilutes the chlorine in","ep042"
"21986",786,"the pool then we can get a little algae","ep042"
"21987",789,"but it's an easy fix","ep042"

"21992",804,"and it's beautiful I mean there's mature","ep042"
"21993",807,"trees I think the pool backyard","ep042"

"22001",831,"it's a good space but we'd have to gut","ep042"
"22002",834,"it all and start over there's some good","ep042"
"22003",837,"but after a lot of work after a lot of","ep042"

"22007",849,"stage in our life where we're gonna be","ep042"

"22014",870,"good size and we could take out that","ep042"
"22015",873,"tile and put some nice brick on there","ep042"
"22016",876,"update it it's nice face built-ins they","ep042"

"22023",897,"possibilities good size it's a very good","ep042"
"22024",900,"size it's kind of narrow so we just have","ep042"
"22025",903,"to get creative and how we place this","ep042"
"22026",906,"furniture leads out to the pool sliding","ep042"
"22027",909,"glass doors yeah two walk-in closets","ep042"

"22036",936,"your own","ep042"
"22037",939,"yeah there's a ton of potential because","ep042"
"22038",942,"we would have to gut all of this every","ep042"
"22039",945,"room needs some bit of work everywhere","ep042"
"22040",948,"and I was really looking for something","ep042"
"22041",951,"that was more move-in ready that we can","ep042"
"22042",954,"enjoy right away a lot of work I can see","ep042"
"22043",957,"it happening there's a lot of room here","ep042"
"22044",960,"for some sweat equity and a good","ep042"
"22045",963,"investment the long run where it's price","ep042"
"22046",966,"now there should be some negotiation","ep042"
"22047",969,"that has been on the market a while and","ep042"
"22048",972,"there should be an opportunity to get a","ep042"
"22049",975,"good good price while Amanda tries to","ep042"

"22121",1191,"it's huge the best feature is it's done","ep042"
"22122",1194,"it is nice there's a few things that I","ep042"
"22123",1197,"would want to update in time I really","ep042"
"22124",1200,"like the fact that there's not a ton of","ep042"
"22125",1203,"projects that I need to do there's not a","ep042"
"22126",1206,"lot of ripping of things out so pool but","ep042"
"22127",1209,"you have a great backyard beautiful","ep042"
"22128",1212,"let's meet our garage and it's priced","ep042"
"22129",1215,"well it is that's probably the biggest","ep042"
"22130",1218,"selling point for me is that price tag","ep042"
"22131",1221,"you know it seems like we're getting a","ep042"
"22132",1224,"lot of bang for our buck over here","ep042"
"22133",1227,"after seeing several options it won't be","ep042"
"22134",1230,"an easy choice for Ben and Amanda their","ep042"
"22135",1233,"decision may come down to bedrooms","ep042"
"22136",1236,"condition and yard size I'm ready to","ep042"
"22137",1239,"just decide on the house under which one","ep042"
"22138",1242,"yeah","ep042"
"22139",1245,"[Music]","ep042"
"22140",1248,"Amanda and Ben have seen how much house","ep042"
"22141",1251,"$500,000 will get them in Tampa now it's","ep042"
"22142",1254,"time to decide the first house the","ep042"
"22143",1257,"Spanish contemporary 4.99","ep042"
"22144",1260,"but we got the most faced with it it was","ep042"
"22145",1263,"a little bit too big I think didn't have","ep042"
"22146",1266,"much of a yard for you but I had a huge","ep042"
"22147",1269,"truth amazing tonight I kind of really","ep042"
"22148",1272,"want a bigger yard and there are some","ep042"
"22149",1275,"updates that I'd want to do and it's","ep042"
"22150",1278,"really at the top of our price range so","ep042"
"22151",1281,"then there was the ranch the ranch that","ep042"
"22152",1284,"one was listed for 402 definitely my","ep042"
"22153",1287,"fixer-upper I think that I could have a","ep042"
"22154",1290,"lot of fun and creating our perfect","ep042"
"22155",1293,"dream home with that I mean we all","ep042"
"22156",1296,"starting new jobs we're gonna be busy","ep042"
"22157",1299,"you're gonna have to adjust down here I","ep042"
"22158",1302,"just don't know if it'd be time to do","ep042"
"22159",1305,"all those projects but it's a good","ep042"
"22160",1308,"compromise in the backyard you have your","ep042"
"22161",1311,"yard I have my pool and then we have the","ep042"
"22162",1314,"craftsman at 345,000 that price I'm","ep042"
"22163",1317,"gonna be hard to beat yeah very hard to","ep042"
"22164",1320,"be a good sized yard it wasn't a pool","ep042"
"22165",1323,"though there was a community pool we","ep042"
"22166",1326,"could utilize the neighborhood was a","ep042"
"22167",1329,"great commute was a little tough to get","ep042"
"22168",1332,"to that great neighborhood but we won't","ep042"
"22169",1335,"have to do anything","ep042"
"22170",1338,"[Music]","ep042"
"22171",1341,"so the craftsman great price is hard to","ep042"
"22172",1344,"beat but I know that Spanish","ep042"
"22173",1347,"contemporary you fell in love with the","ep042"

"22245",102,"DeLuca we're gonna get a little bit more","ep043"
"22246",105,"a village feel I think one of our goals","ep043"

"22256",135,"anxieties are harder to set aside to me","ep043"
"22257",138,"it's a little bit nerve-racking you know","ep043"
"22258",141,"we've saved all this money and you know","ep043"
"22259",144,"to go and take a chance on buying a home","ep043"
"22260",147,"in Italy it's pretty scary you keep","ep043"
"22261",150,"buying things for a house that we don't","ep043"
"22262",153,"have yet and just a candle","ep043"
"22263",156,"jessica's much more relaxed you know she","ep043"
"22264",159,"has everything out on that spreadsheet","ep043"
"22265",162,"so after 30 years I'd feel like we put","ep043"
"22266",165,"in the work and the time and the funds","ep043"
"22267",168,"to really do this right that's right","ep043"
"22268",171,"soaked in Sun and steeped in tradition","ep043"
"22269",174,"the Garvin Jana region of Tuscany is","ep043"
"22270",177,"everything one would expect from an","ep043"
"22271",180,"Italian hilltop Oasis his region is","ep043"
"22272",183,"fairly secluded full of hilltop towns","ep043"
"22273",186,"with rural people and not terribly","ep043"
"22274",189,"touristy and there are lots of beautiful","ep043"
"22275",192,"buildings which are derelict old and so","ep043"
"22276",195,"the price range compared to middle","ep043"
"22277",198,"Tuscany in southern Tuscany northern","ep043"
"22278",201,"Tuscany's more attainable","ep043"
"22279",204,"Phil please bu I can see why you wanted","ep043"
"22280",207,"to meet here it's amazing","ep043"

"22285",222,"have guests who stay here sure we love a","ep043"
"22286",225,"place with a view very important very","ep043"
"22287",228,"important space yes and I would really","ep043"
"22288",231,"like some Tuscan charm so pretty old and","ep043"
"22289",234,"stolen yeah but hopefully with no","ep043"
"22290",237,"renovation something that's looking for","ep043"
"22291",240,"a turnkey right yes turnkey in my mind","ep043"
"22292",243,"we might have to do a little bit of","ep043"
"22293",246,"renovation to get it close to the budget","ep043"
"22294",249,"of course and your budget is one hundred","ep043"
"22295",252,"and twenty thousand US dollars yes","ep043"
"22296",255,"that's going to be rather challenging","ep043"
"22297",258,"without the renovation we can't manage a","ep043"
"22298",261,"renovation from nashville tennessee over","ep043"
"22299",264,"in italy so to me that would be a","ep043"
"22300",267,"deal-breaker","ep043"
"22301",270,"since renovation is what scares Nicky","ep043"
"22302",273,"the most Phillip makes ready to occupy a","ep043"
"22303",276,"priority for house one buongiorno","ep043"
"22304",279,"buongiorno his first house meets Nicky's","ep043"

"22311",300,"much is this one this is 150,000 I","ep043"
"22312",303,"thought you might say that to show you","ep043"
"22313",306,"what the the cost of doing a proper","ep043"
"22314",309,"renovation let's keep an open mind okay","ep043"
"22315",312,"okay and see how we go okay yeah","ep043"

"22320",327,"the owners have put a certain amount of","ep043"
"22321",330,"modernist to their house yes well I like","ep043"
"22322",333,"the fact that it's got a gas stove yes","ep043"
"22323",336,"and plenty of working space yes","ep043"
"22324",339,"absolutely","ep043"
"22325",342,"my first impression was you know it's","ep043"
"22326",345,"immaculate it really into the","ep043"
"22327",348,"instigation in advancement and is this","ep043"
"22328",351,"like the living room or the lounge","ep043"
"22329",354,"living room lounge yeah everything can","ep043"
"22330",357,"just continue so but yes and that beams","ep043"

"22334",369,"yeah it may be a little too modern for","ep043"
"22335",372,"my taste and I would really prefer","ep043"
"22336",375,"something a little more quaint but the","ep043"
"22337",378,"skylights are really pretty oh my god","ep043"
"22338",381,"that's their remote control and that's","ep043"
"22339",384,"why the house is quite cool oh very nice","ep043"
"22340",387,"I think the workmanship is unbelievable","ep043"
"22341",390,"we are moving on to the main bedroom","ep043"
"22342",393,"still not a fan of the furniture to me","ep043"
"22343",396,"again up here it's very modern I was","ep043"
"22344",399,"surprised by the smaller living spaces","ep043"
"22345",402,"smaller bedrooms it's the only bathroom","ep043"
"22346",405,"right yes the owner goes okay","ep043"
"22347",408,"what's nice and it's very clean nice big","ep043"

"22351",420,"you know it's it's fine","ep043"

"22353",426,"renovation that he might really want","ep043"
"22354",429,"this house","ep043"
"22355",432,"but sometimes it's difficult to know","ep043"
"22356",435,"what he's thinking it is very very nice","ep043"
"22357",438,"and that view you cannot oh my god and","ep043"

"22362",453,"Philip lowers the cost and ups the ante","ep043"

"22364",459,"you think so","ep043"

"22800",468,"farther from the city then I was hoping","ep044"
"22801",471,"we don't have a car I feel like it's","ep044"

"22807",489,"the city and the privacy and she has a","ep044"
"22808",492,"few concerns with it but I think we came","ep044"

"22810",498,"perfect location in the heart of","ep044"
"22811",501,"downtown Monta pretty much anything you","ep044"

"22834",570,"move down there on a permanent basis but","ep044"
"22835",573,"with the kids with school it would be","ep044"
"22836",576,"hard to move down there full-time and","ep044"
"22837",579,"with a limited income Kate and Ryan will","ep044"
"22838",582,"need to manage their extensive wish list","ep044"
"22839",585,"we want to be on the beach you know with","ep044"
"22840",588,"an ocean view want to be a little","ep044"

"22842",594,"privacy but be nice to be able to walk","ep044"
"22843",597,"around to get to things for the kids to","ep044"
"22844",600,"do right around us we do as much","ep044"
"22845",603,"researching as we can but that doesn't","ep044"
"22846",606,"take the place of actually jumping in","ep044"
"22847",609,"and just figuring it out we have four","ep044"
"22848",612,"bedrooms seven bathrooms did you say","ep044"

"22902",774,"there's soccer games to pick up on the","ep044"
"22903",777,"beach so the kids can meet a lot of","ep044"
"22904",780,"extra people - OH","ep044"
"22905",783,"likes to be more to himself but I like","ep044"
"22906",786,"being closer to the city and around","ep044"
"22907",789,"people and that might be a little tricky","ep044"
"22908",792,"making a decision because we both want","ep044"
"22909",795,"to love what we choose these are cool","ep044"
"22910",798,"stairs yeah and then here you have a","ep044"
"22911",801,"really nice entertainment area for the","ep044"

"22914",810,"out Kate likes the property a lot but","ep044"
"22915",813,"the truth of the matter is our kids","ep044"
"22916",816,"would trash this place right here's your","ep044"
"22917",819,"master this is so unique that you can","ep044"
"22918",822,"have a balcony inside of your bedroom","ep044"
"22919",825,"inside of your house that's really","ep044"
"22920",828,"really different yeah I'm a little bit","ep044"
"22921",831,"concerned about the sound throughout the","ep044"
"22922",834,"house yeah it looks a little bit small","ep044"
"22923",837,"for a master about a bit yeah yeah you","ep044"
"22924",840,"look good in the shower","ep044"
"22925",843,"oh my thank you everybody likes the","ep044"
"22926",846,"bathrooms but Kate's the first client","ep044"
"22927",849,"we've had that's actually gotten into","ep044"
"22928",852,"the shower now is this gonna be big","ep044"
"22929",855,"enough for the kids yeah handle this","ep044"
"22930",858,"that's a great spot also with this","ep044"
"22931",861,"condominium you have a private gym here","ep044"
"22932",864,"you have a very big Jacuzzi here that's","ep044"
"22933",867,"great","ep044"
"22934",870,"all right here and you know it's so nice","ep044"
"22935",873,"that it's right here in town the kids","ep044"
"22936",876,"can meet a lot of people around here","ep044"
"22937",879,"luxurious more it might be a little too","ep044"
"22938",882,"much I don't know we can be kind of hard","ep044"
"22939",885,"on properties the unit feels a little","ep044"
"22940",888,"bit small it's not a private pool we are","ep044"
"22941",891,"close to the public beach so I worry a","ep044"
"22942",894,"little bit about the privacy there yeah","ep044"
"22943",897,"but I really like","ep044"
"22944",900,"finally some middle ground that's a nice","ep044"
"22945",903,"laundry room that's great with a family","ep044"
"22946",906,"of six I think we can jump off the","ep044"
"22947",909,"balcony into the pool what does the","ep044"
"22948",912,"compromise miss the mark is it a duplex","ep044"
"22949",915,"it is a duplex yes you do have a","ep044"
"22950",918,"neighbor right next door and can someone","ep044"
"22951",921,"else build right in front of us obstruct","ep044"
"22952",924,"the view there we go crazy and hoist the","ep044"
"22953",927,"main ever since Kate Paul and the kids","ep044"
"22954",930,"sailed the Caribbean","ep044"
"22955",933,"they've been itching to get back to","ep044"
"22956",936,"paradise remember when we would have","ep044"
"22957",939,"dolphins following us when they're","ep044"
"22958",942,"jumping off the bow Paul's a little more","ep044"
"22959",945,"impulsive I might think it through a","ep044"
"22960",948,"little bit more but I think he helps me","ep044"
"22961",951,"get out of my comfort zone Balan cater","ep044"
"22962",954,"definitely the adventure-seeking couple","ep044"
"22963",957,"almost to the point of they want to jump","ep044"
"22964",960,"before they actually looked at","ep044"
"22965",963,"everything their wish list is is a","ep044"
"22966",966,"pretty big one they really want the best","ep044"
"22967",969,"of everything oh wow you can see all the","ep044"
"22968",972,"way up to beach is that a whale out","ep044"
"22969",975,"there I think it might be yeah I like","ep044"
"22970",978,"this we're kind of far from the city","ep044"
"22971",981,"though yeah you're about 15 20 minutes","ep044"
"22972",984,"outside of town there are aspects of","ep044"
"22973",987,"this house that are no-win situation","ep044"
"22974",990,"mainly being that it's away from the","ep044"
"22975",993,"city nice for the kids to have a lot of","ep044"
"22976",996,"options to do","ep044"
"22977",999,"so this brings back some memories some","ep044"
"22978",1002,"good ones and some not so when it comes","ep044"
"22979",1005,"right down to it I think that Paul being","ep044"
"22980",1008,"such a gentleman I think he might just","ep044"
"22981",1011,"let Kate have her wish this is bar none","ep044"
"22982",1014,"the most affluent most opulent building","ep044"
"22983",1017,"in the entire city pretty much anything","ep044"
"22984",1020,"you want to do you can walk to and","ep044"
"22985",1023,"that's really convenient when we don't","ep044"
"22986",1026,"have a car I don't necessarily want to","ep044"
"22987",1029,"live in a condo complex I just feel like","ep044"
"22988",1032,"I'm too close to everybody right here","ep044"
"22989",1035,"I think if Paul were here on his own he","ep044"
"22990",1038,"probably would not buy this home he does","ep044"
"22991",1041,"have a few concerns with the privacy","ep044"
"22992",1044,"issues but I really like this house for","ep044"
"22993",1047,"the next home our strategy is gonna be","ep044"
"22994",1050,"to find a home close to town but not too","ep044"
"22995",1053,"far out beach access and it's gonna be","ep044"
"22996",1056,"perfect for them this is a larger","ep044"
"22997",1059,"development it has a ton of amenities as","ep044"
"22998",1062,"well not only do you have your own","ep044"
"22999",1065,"private pool but you also have a","ep044"
"23000",1068,"clubhouse area with multiple pools sauna","ep044"
"23001",1071,"and then for the kids has anything from","ep044"
"23002",1074,"a skate park ramp mountain biking","ep044"
"23003",1077,"walking trails tennis soccer oh you name","ep044"
"23004",1080,"it family kids would have plenty to run","ep044"
"23005",1083,"around and do is it a duplex it is a","ep044"
"23006",1086,"duplex yes you do have a neighbor right","ep044"
"23007",1089,"next door this is three bedrooms three","ep044"
"23008",1092,"and a half baths and what's the price","ep044"
"23009",1095,"for this one this is under your budget","ep044"
"23010",1098,"at just three hundred and thirty five","ep044"
"23011",1101,"thousand okay Wow that sounds good oh","ep044"
"23012",1104,"wow yeah this is of course the main","ep044"
"23013",1107,"focal point of the home you have a","ep044"
"23014",1110,"floating staircase encased in bamboo","ep044"
"23015",1113,"with a cork accent wall and if you look","ep044"
"23016",1116,"up there's a huge skylight up there that","ep044"
"23017",1119,"lets all the natural light flow through","ep044"
"23018",1122,"the home that's all right so this is","ep044"
"23019",1125,"your master suite","ep044"
"23020",1128,"get the recessed lighting but the LEDs","ep044"
"23021",1131,"are actually toggle so you can actually","ep044"
"23022",1134,"position them and then of course you're","ep044"
"23023",1137,"waking up to this beautiful view yet","ep044"
"23024",1140,"again","ep044"
"23025",1143,"the beach likes a little further away","ep044"
"23026",1146,"how do you get to the beach from here","ep044"
"23027",1149,"you don't have direct beach access but","ep044"
"23028",1152,"it's a pretty easy walk just write down","ep044"
"23029",1155,"those steps and you're on your way and","ep044"
"23030",1158,"can someone else build right in front of","ep044"
"23031",1161,"us at obstruct the view yes thank you","ep044"
"23032",1164,"really it is a concern if it might my","ep044"
"23033",1167,"block of view and there is one other","ep044"
"23034",1170,"cool thing about this balcony it leads","ep044"
"23035",1173,"right into your master bathroom","ep044"
"23036",1176,"oh nice you can get to the balcony from","ep044"
"23037",1179,"the bathroom that's interesting","ep044"
"23038",1182,"oh the shower is beautiful and then you","ep044"
"23039",1185,"turn around and you have your","ep044"
"23040",1188,"his-and-hers double sinks that's good","ep044"
"23041",1191,"this part of the staircase leads up to","ep044"
"23042",1194,"the guest floor and then here is the","ep044"
"23043",1197,"kids shared bathroom okay so one baths","ep044"
"23044",1200,"are on this level right I don't know","ep044"
"23045",1203,"about this bathroom it's not very big to","ep044"
"23046",1206,"begin with it's gonna be difficult for","ep044"
"23047",1209,"four kids to share one bathroom sure and","ep044"
"23048",1212,"then this is the first kids bedroom yes","ep044"
"23049",1215,"yeah when they're all here two of them","ep044"
"23050",1218,"will have to share this room they have a","ep044"
"23051",1221,"great ocean view and down here is your","ep044"
"23052",1224,"main living space okay that's pretty","ep044"
"23053",1227,"yeah that's a nice laundry room","ep044"
"23054",1230,"that's great with a family of six I love","ep044"
"23055",1233,"that Kate was most excited that the","ep044"
"23056",1236,"washer and dryer was inside the home","ep044"
"23057",1239,"this time so she didn't have to go","ep044"
"23058",1242,"outside and get her hair wet it seems a","ep044"
"23059",1245,"little bit confined what about a","ep044"
"23060",1248,"bathroom on this level there's actually","ep044"
"23061",1251,"a bathroom outside it's for the pool","ep044"
"23062",1254,"area in this level or social bathroom is","ep044"
"23063",1257,"on the second level okay so the place I","ep044"
"23064",1260,"think we would hang out the most is the","ep044"
"23065",1263,"family Diana we would like to have both","ep044"
"23066",1266,"a laundry room and a bathroom indoors","ep044"
"23067",1269,"crazy but yes it's a cute little pool","ep044"
"23068",1272,"for the two of us I think we'd get jump","ep044"
"23069",1275,"off the balcony into the pool","ep044"
"23070",1278,"yikes somebody might get hurt I'm sure","ep044"
"23071",1281,"the kids will try it at least once or","ep044"
"23072",1284,"twice but it's better than a kick in the","ep044"
"23073",1287,"pants true that point I don't know about","ep044"
"23074",1290,"the three levels and it feels a little","ep044"
"23075",1293,"tight down here on the main living level","ep044"
"23076",1296,"I think you'll be spending majority more","ep044"
"23077",1299,"time yeah probably down the beach yeah I","ep044"
"23078",1302,"like","ep044"
"23079",1305,"this community the kids have a lot of","ep044"
"23080",1308,"things they could do around here but","ep044"
"23081",1311,"there were a lot of neighbors a lot of","ep044"
"23082",1314,"neighboring properties it may not be","ep044"
"23083",1317,"quite as far out of town as I might like","ep044"
"23084",1320,"I think in the next I'm coping your ears","ep044"
"23085",1323,"I was thinking all wants his privacy out","ep044"
"23086",1326,"of town so the standalone house has a","ep044"
"23087",1329,"lot of privacy it has a direct beach","ep044"
"23088",1332,"access","ep044"
"23089",1335,"well Kate's comfort zone is in the city","ep044"

"23107",1389,"be a bit of a battle but when it comes","ep044"
"23108",1392,"right down to it I think that Paul being","ep044"
"23109",1395,"such a gentleman I think he might just","ep044"
"23110",1398,"let Kate have her wish spacious house","ep044"
"23111",1401,"one puts Paul right where he wants to be","ep044"

"23116",1416,"didn't love that the laundry was outside","ep044"
"23117",1419,"and you know it's a little bit further","ep044"
"23118",1422,"away from the city like 15 minute drive","ep044"

"23125",1443,"concerns in the condo yeah but I really","ep044"
"23126",1446,"like this house under budget house three","ep044"
"23127",1449,"bridges the gap but will it be enough","ep044"
"23128",1452,"this is a larger development it has a","ep044"
"23129",1455,"ton of amenities as well kids would have","ep044"
"23130",1458,"plenty to run around and do","ep044"
"23131",1461,"that's a nice laundry room but I think","ep044"
"23132",1464,"it's a little bit small for a family of","ep044"
"23133",1467,"six we could jump off the balcony into","ep044"
"23134",1470,"the pool yes I think you'll be spending","ep044"

"23138",1482,"if I was to eliminate one I think it","ep044"

"23141",1491,"my bathroom when they're here it would","ep044"

"23640",1362,"under budget well the fact that it's","ep045"
"23641",1365,"under budget leaves you some extra money","ep045"
"23642",1368,"to decide what works the best yeah all","ep045"
"23643",1371,"right","ep045"
"23644",1374,"bold swings or conservative compromises","ep045"
"23645",1377,"and I don't know what decision is the","ep045"
"23646",1380,"right decision yeah I'm super torn it's","ep045"
"23647",1383,"gonna be a tough one for us drinks look","ep045"

"23650",1392,"but they'll have to decide what kind of","ep045"
"23651",1395,"life they can afford to take on to do it","ep045"
"23652",1398,"let's go all right let's make a decision","ep045"
"23653",1401,"so the first one we looked at was the","ep045"
"23654",1404,"villa you really liked it it was pretty","ep045"
"23655",1407,"breathtaking","ep045"
"23656",1410,"with the domed ceilings the","ep045"
"23657",1413,"three-bedroom it has the outdoor area","ep045"
"23658",1416,"for me to be able to have my barbecue","ep045"
"23659",1419,"yeah however it was $70,000 over budget","ep045"
"23660",1422,"yeah and they're building a condo","ep045"
"23661",1425,"complex and your back door basically","ep045"
"23662",1428,"right in the 2-bedroom 2-bath that was","ep045"
"23663",1431,"absolutely amazing","ep045"
"23664",1434,"but it was over budget and it wasn't","ep045"
"23665",1437,"totally finished there are still some","ep045"
"23666",1440,"things we needed to do and then the cozy","ep045"
"23667",1443,"condo this does have the same ocean","ep045"
"23668",1446,"views a kind of aha factor when you walk","ep045"
"23669",1449,"in the main door yeah that wasn't we","ep045"
"23670",1452,"were looking for but it didn't had","ep045"
"23671",1455,"around for the barbecue but it was under","ep045"
"23672",1458,"budget it was the only unit we saw that","ep045"
"23673",1461,"was under budget exactly right","ep045"
"23674",1464,"[Music]","ep045"
"23675",1467,"I think we have to eliminate the villa","ep045"
"23676",1470,"because it's so far over budget and it","ep045"
"23677",1473,"doesn't have the ocean view that we're","ep045"
"23678",1476,"looking for it's it's my dream to be","ep045"
"23679",1479,"able to have something like that but","ep045"

"23812",234,"crown molding the little doorknobs and","ep046"
"23813",237,"hardwood floors would just be really","ep046"
"23814",240,"awesome to plan I really wouldn't like","ep046"
"23815",243,"to find spaces I want it to be open and","ep046"
"23816",246,"for you to be able to like look from the","ep046"
"23817",249,"kitchen into the living room this is","ep046"

"23819",255,"be looking well we could change the","ep046"
"23820",258,"cabinet's but the Florida great","ep046"
"23821",261,"everything else looks great I don't want","ep046"
"23822",264,"to move into somebody else's personality","ep046"
"23823",267,"or somebody else's character I would","ep046"
"23824",270,"love to take on a fixer-upper","ep046"
"23825",273,"if it was a major fixer-upper that would","ep046"
"23826",276,"be non-negotiable for me I can't imagine","ep046"
"23827",279,"having to be living with the two dogs in","ep046"
"23828",282,"a construction zone for a couple weeks","ep046"
"23829",285,"backyard is a little small but deck is a","ep046"
"23830",288,"little small I'd be hard to entertain","ep046"

"23832",294,"I really like the white cabinets see a","ep046"
"23833",297,"white kitchen to me it would be ideal I","ep046"
"23834",300,"prefer dark cabinets and granite","ep046"
"23835",303,"countertops it's a nerve-racking","ep046"
"23836",306,"experience this movie is to be exciting","ep046"
"23837",309,"can happen here we are this is your","ep046"
"23838",312,"typical beach bungalow not very","ep046"
"23839",315,"Victorian know if you're gonna find","ep046"
"23840",318,"Victorian at the beach it's a 2-bedroom","ep046"
"23841",321,"1-bath one bathroom will be an issue I","ep046"
"23842",324,"really know I know it's just about six","ep046"
"23843",327,"blocks from the ocean oh that's awesome","ep046"
"23844",330,"it's right at 850 square feet","ep046"
"23845",333,"the list price 225 I mean definitely the","ep046"
"23846",336,"price makes me a little worried because","ep046"
"23847",339,"it does look like it needs a lot of work","ep046"
"23848",342,"but six bucks let's take a look all","ep046"
"23849",345,"right","ep046"
"23850",348,"Wow well I like small cozy little","ep046"
"23851",351,"smaller than its definitely really small","ep046"
"23852",354,"and look at these floors I mean this is","ep046"
"23853",357,"just","ep046"
"23854",360,"we'd have to rip all of this out we","ep046"
"23855",363,"can't say that this is definitely a","ep046"
"23856",366,"project the owner had started a rehab","ep046"
"23857",369,"and decided to settle before he finished","ep046"
"23858",372,"so there's a lot of undone things in","ep046"
"23859",375,"this place well I was excited about a","ep046"
"23860",378,"fixer-upper","ep046"
"23861",381,"but it might be a little bit bigger of a","ep046"
"23862",384,"project than we expected","ep046"
"23863",387,"I do think that Jose seems a little bit","ep046"
"23864",390,"more nervous and he initially did when","ep046"
"23865",393,"he said he wanted a fixer-upper so we've","ep046"
"23866",396,"got this kitchen looking decent they've","ep046"
"23867",399,"done some updates in here what do you","ep046"
"23868",402,"think I mean my my initial thought is","ep046"
"23869",405,"that there's really no counter space in","ep046"
"23870",408,"here there's a little small board I do","ep046"
"23871",411,"like about it is that we can actually","ep046"
"23872",414,"maybe tick down that wall and you have","ep046"
"23873",417,"that open floor plan that I've always","ep046"
"23874",420,"wanted now you want to take down walls","ep046"
"23875",423,"not that big of a deal pretty easy fix","ep046"
"23876",426,"and I want to show you this utility room","ep046"
"23877",429,"you've got a tankless hot water heater","ep046"
"23878",432,"and a new electrical box that's a big","ep046"
"23879",435,"deal and we could definitely make this","ep046"
"23880",438,"into a pantry closet Yeah right now I'm","ep046"
"23881",441,"not really seeing my cereal next to","ep046"
"23882",444,"these machines across the kitchen","ep046"
"23883",447,"there's a laundry room there's some","ep046"
"23884",450,"great space in here this is almost like","ep046"
"23885",453,"another bedroom this is huge I","ep046"
"23886",456,"definitely see potential in here we","ep046"
"23887",459,"could even make this into another","ep046"
"23888",462,"bathroom and you should give us the two","ep046"
"23889",465,"two that we were looking for turning the","ep046"
"23890",468,"laundry room into the bathroom it's just","ep046"
"23891",471,"really scary to me it seems like it's","ep046"
"23892",474,"gonna be a really big project and I have","ep046"
"23893",477,"no idea what to expect so let's take a","ep046"
"23894",480,"look outside I think you're really gonna","ep046"
"23895",483,"like this backyard","ep046"
"23896",486,"it's is what I'm talking about look at","ep046"
"23897",489,"all this space for Jackson Luna they're","ep046"
"23898",492,"gonna love that I could totally see them","ep046"
"23899",495,"having a blast out here back inside they","ep046"
"23900",498,"see the bungalows only bathroom is this","ep046"
"23901",501,"oh my gosh I mean there's no walls yes","ep046"
"23902",504,"but this is the empty canvas I was","ep046"
"23903",507,"talking about we can start from scratch","ep046"
"23904",510,"all I hear are dollar signs and having","ep046"
"23905",513,"to live in a construction zone and we","ep046"
"23906",516,"just wouldn't even have a bathroom for a","ep046"
"23907",519,"couple days or weeks around the corner","ep046"
"23908",522,"from the bathroom they see the first","ep046"
"23909",525,"bedroom kind of the big windows I'm so","ep046"
"23910",528,"much light I mean the floor is just","ep046"
"23911",531,"there's nothing empty canvas there you","ep046"
"23912",534,"go","ep046"
"23913",537,"so guys let's go check out the master","ep046"
"23914",540,"this is kind of small to be a master I","ep046"
"23915",543,"feel like we could just extend our arms","ep046"
"23916",546,"it is a smaller house so the rooms are","ep046"
"23917",549,"gonna be smaller too we can open this","ep046"
"23918",552,"wall up and you'll go right into that","ep046"
"23919",555,"bathroom that's right but then that","ep046"
"23920",558,"takes away wall space and now another","ep046"
"23921",561,"construction project I mean that just is","ep046"
"23922",564,"a project project this is a project","ep046"
"23923",567,"Karen and Jose have all these grands","ep046"
"23924",570,"ideas about what to do that all I hear","ep046"
"23925",573,"it's just more money into renovations","ep046"
"23926",576,"and more projects and more unknowns they","ep046"
"23927",579,"just are dreamers and I'm just trying to","ep046"
"23928",582,"be realistic so tell me what you guys","ep046"
"23929",585,"think of the house well it's just not a","ep046"
"23930",588,"Victorian it's definitely really far","ep046"
"23931",591,"from the style that I was looking for","ep046"
"23932",594,"what is a great location we're a six","ep046"
"23933",597,"block beach but another issue is it's","ep046"
"23934",600,"only one bathroom we were looking for a","ep046"
"23935",603,"two backing place that is huge and it's","ep046"
"23936",606,"also complete rehab but I do want a","ep046"
"23937",609,"fixer-upper but this might be a little","ep046"
"23938",612,"too much since Amanda wants a home with","ep046"
"23939",615,"character Karen has lined one up but","ep046"
"23940",618,"Jose sees a problem you know we're like","ep046"
"23941",621,"30 minutes away from the ocean I'm","ep046"
"23942",624,"thinking maybe 20 you really think it's","ep046"
"23943",627,"30","ep046"
"23944",630,"I know it's 30","ep046"
"23945",633,"like those Jose and Amanda are tired of","ep046"
"23946",636,"cramped apartment living so with a 230","ep046"
"23947",639,"thousand dollar budget they're looking","ep046"
"23948",642,"for a home in Jacksonville Beach with","ep046"
"23949",645,"space to grow into Jose thinks beachside","ep046"
"23950",648,"living is the best but Amanda's not","ep046"
"23951",651,"convinced so far they've seen an 850","ep046"
"23952",654,"square foot beach bungalow six blocks","ep046"
"23953",657,"from the water but it only had one","ep046"
"23954",660,"bathroom and needed massive renovations","ep046"
"23955",663,"so their agent Karen is hoping to move","ep046"
"23956",666,"inland combined with more square footage","ep046"
"23957",669,"will win Amanda over so this is","ep046"
"23958",672,"historical Springfield we're on the","ep046"
"23959",675,"outskirts of downtown I do really love","ep046"
"23960",678,"the neighborhood it's very central it's","ep046"
"23961",681,"a kind of everything in Jacksonville you","ep046"
"23962",684,"know we're like 30 minutes away from the","ep046"
"23963",687,"ocean I think it may be 20 you really","ep046"
"23964",690,"think it's 30","ep046"
"23965",693,"I know it's 30 by the lack of salt in","ep046"
"23966",696,"the air I'm open to the idea of living","ep046"
"23967",699,"this far out from the beach it lets us","ep046"
"23968",702,"explore an area that we really don't","ep046"
"23969",705,"know about Jacksonville so it really","ep046"
"23970",708,"doesn't bother me that's too far any","ep046"
"23971",711,"location is a huge problem I came in","ep046"
"23972",714,"smell of salt in the air and that just","ep046"
"23973",717,"depresses me this is a craftsman it's","ep046"
"23974",720,"not really the Victorian that you were","ep046"
"23975",723,"looking for but we couldn't find that in","ep046"
"23976",726,"your price point this is a three-bedroom","ep046"

"24096",1086,"a huge plus but the one bathroom is a","ep046"
"24097",1089,"big issue we were definitely needing it","ep046"

"24107",1119,"into the dining area the only thing I","ep046"
"24108",1122,"don't like is Ali's defined spaces kind","ep046"

"24115",1143,"the kitchen","ep046"
"24116",1146,"those white cabinets are exactly what I","ep046"
"24117",1149,"was looking for I'm not a huge fan of","ep046"
"24118",1152,"the dark countertops I definitely would","ep046"
"24119",1155,"have wanted something a little bit more","ep046"
"24120",1158,"light and airy this goes into your","ep046"
"24121",1161,"garage Oh Oh Raj who you put all our","ep046"

"24128",1182,"you've got a really good-sized backyard","ep046"
"24129",1185,"out here I think I wanted a little bit","ep046"
"24130",1188,"more of that green lawn and have a","ep046"
"24131",1191,"little bit more grass than what's here","ep046"
"24132",1194,"back inside they see the spare bedroom","ep046"
"24133",1197,"and the only bathroom actually almost","ep046"
"24134",1200,"the same size all right so come on over","ep046"

"24149",1245,"huge garage I know we were done I like","ep046"
"24150",1248,"it the bungalow style now the big con","ep046"
"24151",1251,"for me is how far it is from the beach","ep046"
"24152",1254,"you know it's not that far we're talking","ep046"
"24153",1257,"20 minutes if you have to get in your","ep046"
"24154",1260,"car it's too far I think we just need to","ep046"

"24156",1266,"kind of see what makes sense for us","ep046"

"24162",1284,"most important a beachside location a","ep046"
"24163",1287,"move-in-ready home or extra storage","ep046"
"24164",1290,"space we really need to make a decision","ep046"
"24165",1293,"[Music]","ep046"
"24166",1296,"we really need to make a decision with a","ep046"
"24167",1299,"two hundred and thirty thousand dollar","ep046"
"24168",1302,"budget Jose and Amanda are eager for","ep046"
"24169",1305,"more space in their first home together","ep046"
"24170",1308,"we start with the each bunch of","ep046"
"24171",1311,"locations awesome that's exactly what we","ep046"
"24172",1314,"wanted the only thing is it needs so","ep046"
"24173",1317,"much work and it is already 2:25 the","ep046"
"24174",1320,"bathroom is just completely gutted and","ep046"
"24175",1323,"it's the only bathroom but it's the","ep046"
"24176",1326,"empty campus I mean we can make it our","ep046"
"24177",1329,"own but I do kind of love that it does","ep046"
"24178",1332,"have a little bit of character some","ep046"
"24179",1335,"history to it it's it's really cute we","ep046"
"24180",1338,"have the Craftsman at 250 a little bit","ep046"
"24181",1341,"more inland in Jacksonville it is over a","ep046"
"24182",1344,"budget but then we don't have to spend","ep046"
"24183",1347,"any money on renovating I love just how","ep046"
"24184",1350,"Airy and just big it feels in there but","ep046"
"24185",1353,"when we walked in it was a little bit","ep046"
"24186",1356,"just bland it just really was lacking","ep046"
"24187",1359,"that personality that I was looking for","ep046"
"24188",1362,"we're also a good 35 minute drive on the","ep046"
"24189",1365,"beach with no traffic if you have to","ep046"
"24190",1368,"drive to the beach the 219 renovated","ep046"
"24191",1371,"bungalow yeah I like the bungalow style","ep046"
"24192",1374,"the only thing is it is a 25-minute","ep046"
"24193",1377,"drive from the beach it is but it's also","ep046"
"24194",1380,"almost move-in ready and that garage I","ep046"
"24195",1383,"mean that was I love that garage but one","ep046"
"24196",1386,"thing I did hate it was those define","ep046"
"24197",1389,"spaces if you walk in you have a little","ep046"
"24198",1392,"room you walk five feet in and you have","ep046"
"24199",1395,"another room and one bathroom would be a","ep046"
"24200",1398,"bit of an issue for us so which one will","ep046"
"24201",1401,"they pick","ep046"
"24202",1404,"[Music]","ep046"
"24203",1407,"so it just comes down to what are we","ep046"
"24204",1410,"willing to compromise think we can","ep046"
"24205",1413,"definitely eliminate one off the bat the","ep046"
"24206",1416,"renovated bungalow it's just too","ep046"
"24207",1419,"segmented for us the space is a way too","ep046"
"24208",1422,"defined I don't think that's the right","ep046"
"24209",1425,"house for a green so now we're down to","ep046"
"24210",1428,"Springfield and the beach bungalow I","ep046"
"24211",1431,"think we have a lot of space in","ep046"
"24212",1434,"Springfield opportunities to grow and","ep046"
"24213",1437,"it's move-in ready I think","ep046"
"24214",1440,"beach house is where it's at I mean we","ep046"
"24215",1443,"could change the front room next to the","ep046"
"24216",1446,"kitchen into a bathroom we could tear","ep046"
"24217",1449,"down that wall ice in the kitchen and","ep046"
"24218",1452,"I'll really open it up it will be a big","ep046"
"24219",1455,"project but we can totally take it on I","ep046"
"24220",1458,"do have to say that being six blocks","ep046"
"24221",1461,"from the beach sounds really nice I know","ep046"
"24222",1464,"so that it we're doing we chose the","ep046"
"24223",1467,"beach bungalow primarily because we're","ep046"
"24224",1470,"six blocks from the beach everything","ep046"
"24225",1473,"that we do all of our friends is here on","ep046"
"24226",1476,"the beach it is nice having the beaches","ep046"
"24227",1479,"your backyard and you're gonna be able","ep046"
"24228",1482,"to relax very relaxing the list price of","ep046"
"24229",1485,"this house was 225 and we instead of","ep046"
"24230",1488,"getting it for 218 so we closed on the","ep046"
"24231",1491,"house two weeks ago and we already","ep046"
"24232",1494,"started renovations this is where the","ep046"
"24233",1497,"second bathroom is gonna be the house","ep046"
"24234",1500,"will be ready maybe two to three weeks","ep046"
"24235",1503,"and that's when we move in we put the","ep046"
"24236",1506,"vinyl flooring in so we started over in","ep046"
"24237",1509,"the bedrooms and we just worked all the","ep046"
"24238",1512,"way through the living room we also","ep046"
"24239",1515,"started redoing the master bedroom we","ep046"
"24240",1518,"opened up a hole in this wall and gave","ep046"
"24241",1521,"us access to the bathroom so now we have","ep046"
"24242",1524,"a master bathroom I'm actually doing a","ep046"
"24243",1527,"lot better than I thought with the","ep046"

"24251",1551,"that eventually we're gonna kind of","ep046"
"24252",1554,"outgrow the space and we're probably","ep046"
"24253",1557,"gonna need something a little bit bigger","ep046"
"24254",1560,"but I think for now there is a lot of","ep046"
"24255",1563,"opportunities to make it our own we can","ep046"
"24256",1566,"just customize things and that I'm","ep046"
"24257",1569,"really happy about I really feel like we","ep046"

"24293",111,"barbecue at my house and we ended up so","ep047"
"24294",114,"Brooke moved back to the States","ep047"

"24302",138,"somewhere where we really really love","ep047"
"24303",141,"and because I took her away 15 years ago","ep047"

"24312",168,"Paris is full of life and a lot of","ep047"
"24313",171,"energy there's a lot of movement so many","ep047"
"24314",174,"different people","ep047"
"24315",177,"I think the architecture sort of sets","ep047"
"24316",180,"the stage in the city so you already","ep047"
"24317",183,"have this beautiful backdrop and then to","ep047"
"24318",186,"add all the different types of people","ep047"
"24319",189,"and street artists and musicians you","ep047"
"24320",192,"can't go down a street in Paris and not","ep047"
"24321",195,"sort of feel inspired or re-energized","ep047"
"24322",198,"about life because there's so much going","ep047"
"24323",201,"on and it's so beautiful and let's not","ep047"
"24324",204,"forget the food we're looking for a","ep047"
"24325",207,"2-bedroom apartment and we'd love to be","ep047"
"24326",210,"in the Marais if possible I lived in","ep047"
"24327",213,"Paris many years ago and to me that","ep047"
"24328",216,"place is the most beautiful and","ep047"
"24329",219,"inspiring do you care whether it's old","ep047"
"24330",222,"or new or for me the older the better I","ep047"
"24331",225,"love her Asian charm old details well I","ep047"
"24332",228,"agree with Brooke on the charm I would","ep047"
"24333",231,"love it to have modern appliances and","ep047"
"24334",234,"modern amenities we have two boys they","ep047"
"24335",237,"are rambunctious and very active so I","ep047"
"24336",240,"would love the two-bedroom to be as","ep047"
"24337",243,"large as possible I would love enough","ep047"
"24338",246,"space to have a home office you're","ep047"
"24339",249,"working from home yes I work from home","ep047"

"24342",258,"gonna really try to show them properties","ep047"
"24343",261,"in the Mara but I have one I'm thinking","ep047"
"24344",264,"is even better and that's where Adrian","ep047"
"24345",267,"begins the house hunt on an island in a","ep047"
"24346",270,"mid","ep047"
"24347",273,"of the same distance the Ile de la Cite","ep047"
"24348",276,"a and of course you're not in the Marais","ep047"
"24349",279,"but the Mara is really right there you","ep047"
"24350",282,"can see it from here so you're in the","ep047"
"24351",285,"heart of the city I mean this is where","ep047"
"24352",288,"life began in Paris Wow doesn't get more","ep047"
"24353",291,"historic than this it's a two-bedroom","ep047"
"24354",294,"apartment in this building and it's on","ep047"
"24355",297,"courtyard so you're not gonna hear the","ep047"
"24356",300,"noise of this tree this has got to be","ep047"
"24357",303,"way over budget no it's right on budget","ep047"
"24358",306,"it's $2,600 a month yes okay come on in","ep047"
"24359",309,"those wood beams","ep047"
"24360",312,"that's look old that's 18th century","ep047"
"24361",315,"beings things like this I love I love","ep047"
"24362",318,"chandeliers I love decorative details","ep047"
"24363",321,"and now you've got a nice big dining","ep047"
"24364",324,"space mm-hmm and then you've got a full","ep047"
"24365",327,"kitchen and a fairly big fridge the","ep047"
"24366",330,"kitchen is pretty small don't forget it","ep047"
"24367",333,"kind of makes reverse El in a way","ep047"
"24368",336,"Hey","ep047"
"24369",339,"something about it doesn't mesh with the","ep047"
"24370",342,"rest of the apartment okay so and you","ep047"
"24371",345,"know a pretty good-sized living room","ep047"
"24372",348,"yeah we could fit here we could put the","ep047"
"24373",351,"boys on our laps for me","ep047"
"24374",354,"the French charm the style of kind of","ep047"
"24375",357,"old Paris isn't as important to me as","ep047"
"24376",360,"finding a comfortable apartment because","ep047"
"24377",363,"we have Paris all around us and then one","ep047"
"24378",366,"of the bedrooms is here oh wow oh wow","ep047"
"24379",369,"yeah so here you've got a second bedroom","ep047"
"24380",372,"and I actually think that in this","ep047"
"24381",375,"apartment it would be better to put the","ep047"
"24382",378,"boys in the master bedroom yeah","ep047"
"24383",381,"well the boys have taken out over most","ep047"
"24384",384,"of our lives so to me it's really","ep047"
"24385",387,"one-and-a-half bedrooms because that","ep047"
"24386",390,"second bedroom is sort of an extension","ep047"
"24387",393,"of the living room so this master","ep047"
"24388",396,"bedroom is over here very nice another","ep047"
"24389",399,"chandelier for you so you know this bed","ep047"
"24390",402,"is really twins put together which means","ep047"
"24391",405,"that for the boys it could make sense so","ep047"
"24392",408,"what I haven't seen is a space to work","ep047"
"24393",411,"they think that at the entry table","ep047"
"24394",414,"that's a spot you could put a desk in","ep047"
"24395",417,"also there's the corner where the TV is","ep047"
"24396",420,"in the living room right right I love","ep047"
"24397",423,"the wooden beams I love the chandeliers","ep047"
"24398",426,"this place uses Parisian charm and I","ep047"
"24399",429,"particularly love the master bedroom it","ep047"
"24400",432,"has everything we asked for I still feel","ep047"
"24401",435,"that it's a little tight this seems like","ep047"
"24402",438,"we kind of bouncing off the walls a","ep047"
"24403",441,"little bit I keep going back to the","ep047"
"24404",444,"Marais I would say that this","ep047"
"24405",447,"neighborhood doesn't quite have the same","ep047"
"24406",450,"energy as","ep047"
"24407",453,"if they gave the illu ICT a chance i","ep047"
"24408",456,"think they'd ultimately love it even","ep047"
"24409",459,"more than the moiré really in the heart","ep047"
"24410",462,"of the moiré whoa I love red it's a lot","ep047"
"24411",465,"of red actually I still don't see room","ep047"
"24412",468,"for a desk or even a dining room table","ep047"
"24413",471,"and what's wrong with America it's old","ep047"
"24414",474,"chair it's just","ep047"
"24415",477,"[Music]","ep047"
"24416",480,"guys look this is a magic place Brooke","ep047"
"24417",483,"has longed to return to Paris since","ep047"
"24418",486,"living here 15 years ago I moved here","ep047"
"24419",489,"and I fell in love with the city and now","ep047"
"24420",492,"she's done it this time with a husband","ep047"
"24421",495,"and two young boys it was always just a","ep047"
"24422",498,"dream because it seemed like such a far","ep047"
"24423",501,"off goal these cards are jumping I think","ep047"
"24424",504,"it was our last trip that really planted","ep047"
"24425",507,"a seed for us because Jonas was working","ep047"
"24426",510,"remotely and we finally realized yeah","ep047"
"24427",513,"this could happen I mean I don't speak","ep047"
"24428",516,"French so I was a little bit intimidated","ep047"
"24429",519,"by the idea but because Brooke had lived","ep047"
"24430",522,"here before and because she knows the","ep047"
"24431",525,"language so well I felt comfortable can","ep047"
"24432",528,"I check the biggest challenge may be","ep047"
"24433",531,"quickly agreeing on and nabbing a place","ep047"
"24434",534,"in this fast-moving market a willing to","ep047"
"24435",537,"sacrifice a lot of things to get into a","ep047"
"24436",540,"place sooner for me that's more of a","ep047"
"24437",543,"priority than getting the perfect","ep047"
"24438",546,"environment that puts house one in play","ep047"
"24439",549,"it's on budget and it has everything we","ep047"
"24440",552,"asked for I still feel that it's a","ep047"
"24441",555,"little tight I would say that this","ep047"
"24442",558,"neighborhood doesn't quite have the same","ep047"
"24443",561,"energy as the Marais","ep047"
"24444",564,"Mahe means swamp and Fitz it's maze of","ep047"
"24445",567,"narrow streets Adrien walks them","ep047"
"24446",570,"straight into it for house 2 you're","ep047"
"24447",573,"really in the heart of the Marais and","ep047"
"24448",576,"this is a treasure of a street this is","ep047"
"24449",579,"the Rue du trésor meaning treasure","ep047"
"24450",582,"it's unbelievable isn't it beautiful the","ep047"
"24451",585,"apartment is right here on the first","ep047"
"24452",588,"floor this beautiful building it's two","ep047"
"24453",591,"bedrooms it has a big modern kitchen","ep047"
"24454",594,"with a big refrigerator and best of all","ep047"
"24455",597,"it's right on your budget at $2,600 a","ep047"
"24456",600,"month so I think this street would be","ep047"
"24457",603,"great for the kids because it's there's","ep047"
"24458",606,"no cars exactly perfil decide for them","ep047"
"24459",609,"so let's go out okay I was surprised to","ep047"
"24460",612,"find a cul-de-sac in Paris all right","ep047"
"24461",615,"whoa this I love red that's a lot of red","ep047"
"24462",618,"actually Plus look Jonas look at the","ep047"
"24463",621,"size of that refrigerator I noticed a","ep047"
"24464",624,"dishwasher too nice plus it's a full","ep047"
"24465",627,"oven and a four-burner stove and a","ep047"
"24466",630,"microwave lots of storage this that's","ep047"
"24467",633,"what we need I love this oh there's a","ep047"
"24468",636,"decorative fireplace and I really like","ep047"
"24469",639,"this mirror it makes the room feel more","ep047"
"24470",642,"open plus you've got a door directly","ep047"
"24471",645,"into the living room okay I see I see","ep047"
"24472",648,"okay the other ones a decent size but I","ep047"
"24473",651,"still don't see kind of room for a desk","ep047"
"24474",654,"or even a dining room table I suggest","ep047"
"24475",657,"maybe adding a dining room table in this","ep047"
"24476",660,"corner and over there would be a good","ep047"
"24477",663,"nook for a desk I love this decorative","ep047"
"24478",666,"fireplace again and the mirror yeah well","ep047"
"24479",669,"what's wrong with the mirror looks like","ep047"
"24480",672,"it's a little dirty it's old it's just","ep047"
"24481",675,"old I love the idea of having French","ep047"
"24482",678,"charm but I don't need it and if the","ep047"
"24483",681,"apartment comes modern with clean lines","ep047"
"24484",684,"I'm happy so you see here's the second","ep047"
"24485",687,"bedroom that's just off the kitchen okay","ep047"
"24486",690,"yes it's a good-sized room for the boys","ep047"
"24487",693,"I am still a little concerned about the","ep047"
"24488",696,"bed I really wish we had twin beds maybe","ep047"
"24489",699,"the landlord would be willing to change","ep047"
"24490",702,"it out right now I'm feeling a lot of","ep047"
"24491",705,"pressure to find a place and not only","ep047"
"24492",708,"find a place but find the right place I","ep047"
"24493",711,"think that in terms of decorative","ep047"
"24494",714,"details it's got it all for me","ep047"
"24495",717,"I like the kitchen in general I don't","ep047"
"24496",720,"know how we could have people over for","ep047"
"24497",723,"dinner and I think if I put a desk in","ep047"
"24498",726,"there and we put a dining room in there","ep047"
"24499",729,"I'm just afraid that there's not a lot","ep047"
"24500",732,"of play area for the boys both Brooke","ep047"
"24501",735,"and Jonas are concerned that the living","ep047"
"24502",738,"room is not large enough to handle a","ep047"
"24503",741,"living room a dining room and a desk and","ep047"
"24504",744,"it's missing that furniture so it means","ep047"
"24505",747,"they'd have to add it the next apartment","ep047"
"24506",750,"I show them is considerably larger and","ep047"
"24507",753,"has","ep047"
"24508",756,"a lot more space with a big dining room","ep047"
"24509",759,"table and space for an office two full","ep047"
"24510",762,"bedrooms and a big plus two full","ep047"
"24511",765,"bathrooms","ep047"
"24512",768,"[Laughter]","ep047"
"24513",771,"[Music]","ep047"
"24514",774,"when Brooke met Jonas it eventually","ep047"
"24515",777,"meant that she would have to leave her","ep047"
"24516",780,"beloved Paris move back to the states I","ep047"
"24517",783,"left Paris because Jonas didn't really","ep047"
"24518",786,"have an opportunity to work here USA he","ep047"
"24519",789,"wasn't able to get working papers he","ep047"
"24520",792,"didn't speak French so her love for","ep047"
"24521",795,"Jonas took her away from Paris so I was","ep047"
"24522",798,"hoping that maybe one day I could make","ep047"
"24523",801,"it happen again","ep047"
"24524",804,"but now he's bringing her back out of","ep047"
"24525",807,"his love we just really want an","ep047"
"24526",810,"adventure and it's hard not to have an","ep047"
"24527",813,"adventure in Paris having started their","ep047"
"24528",816,"own company all they need now is to find","ep047"
"24529",819,"a place to live my top priority is space","ep047"
"24530",822,"house one doesn't provide that for Jonas","ep047"
"24531",825,"we could fit here together","ep047"
"24532",828,"but it's right up Brookes alley I love","ep047"
"24533",831,"the wooden beams I love the chandeliers","ep047"
"24534",834,"this place of oozes Parisian charm and I","ep047"
"24535",837,"particularly love the master bedroom I","ep047"
"24536",840,"think Brookes number one priority is","ep047"
"24537",843,"location house 2 hits that on the nose","ep047"
"24538",846,"for Brooke you're really in the heart of","ep047"
"24539",849,"the Marais I think this street would be","ep047"
"24540",852,"great for the kids because it's a","ep047"
"24541",855,"cul-de-sac oldest ass but still has its","ep047"
"24542",858,"space challenges for Jonas I still don't","ep047"
"24543",861,"see room for a desk or even a dining","ep047"
"24544",864,"room table that difference could make","ep047"
"24545",867,"house 3 a topic of hot debate as Adrian","ep047"
"24546",870,"moves away from Center to deliver enough","ep047"
"24547",873,"space for Jonas so right now we're on","ep047"
"24548",876,"Rue de fée Ducal there okay this is the","ep047"
"24549",879,"northern moiré it's a little more","ep047"
"24550",882,"residential because it's not as touristy","ep047"
"24551",885,"and it's in this building right here so","ep047"
"24552",888,"how many bedrooms two bedrooms but it","ep047"
"24553",891,"has two bathrooms in our budget it's a","ep047"
"24554",894,"little over your budget at 2750 per","ep047"
"24555",897,"month","ep047"
"24556",900,"it's not to much over we'll have to see","ep047"
"24557",903,"so come on in opulence that's just good","ep047"
"24558",906,"word for it I mean look at the gold","ep047"
"24559",909,"detail on the fireplace incredible this","ep047"

"24658",1206,"ever wanted to have people over that","ep047"

"24675",1257,"one and a half bedrooms I know you said","ep047"
"24676",1260,"that you had one in mind already I","ep047"
"24677",1263,"thought that the best place for us was","ep047"
"24678",1266,"the northern moiré because it was so","ep047"
"24679",1269,"big the second bedroom for the boys has","ep047"

"24890",498,"looking for the furnishings are little","ep048"
"24891",501,"too traditional and it will require work","ep048"
"24892",504,"and quite a bit of work to get it where","ep048"
"24893",507,"I want it to be it's not very beachy now","ep048"
"24894",510,"but with a little bit of work I think we","ep048"

"24896",516,"really nice is this the only dining","ep048"
"24897",519,"table it is wow man this isn't even big","ep048"

"24901",531,"large kitchen here this is nice cabinets","ep048"
"24902",534,"but I was hoping for something lighter","ep048"
"24903",537,"for the beach house I mean we paint the","ep048"
"24904",540,"cabinet's easily I like the fact that a","ep048"
"24905",543,"stainless steel appliances appliance is","ep048"
"24906",546,"a nice let's take a look at the master","ep048"
"24907",549,"bedroom okay this is a great-sized room","ep048"
"24908",552,"what do you think about the furnishings","ep048"
"24909",555,"looks a little bulky a little too big","ep048"
"24910",558,"for the room and it doesn't look very","ep048"
"24911",561,"beachy but you know you could easily","ep048"
"24912",564,"change out the comforter or maybe some","ep048"
"24913",567,"pillows or make it a lot feature look at","ep048"
"24914",570,"that's a nice big room it's a good","ep048"

"24919",585,"that you'd add context this double","ep048"
"24920",588,"vanity","ep048"
"24921",591,"yeah it's a dual identity at least","ep048"
"24922",594,"you've got the tall cabinets which is","ep048"
"24923",597,"great nice sounds master bath again with","ep048"
"24924",600,"some work it's gonna be great I do like","ep048"
"24925",603,"the fact that there's a nice long","ep048"
"24926",606,"driveway it's good for us and the fact","ep048"
"24927",609,"that renters can park as many cars as","ep048"
"24928",612,"they want but you're not gonna have pool","ep048"
"24929",615,"I think we can make it work all of this","ep048"
"24930",618,"driveway space you probably could cut","ep048"
"24931",621,"off some but it could be done to make","ep048"
"24932",624,"this house work I obviously need to put","ep048"
"24933",627,"a pool in the dust within my budget for","ep048"

"24935",633,"this house back inside they head","ep048"
"24936",636,"upstairs to see the remaining bedroom","ep048"
"24937",639,"spaces this actually used to be two","ep048"
"24938",642,"bedrooms and they actually opened it up","ep048"

"24940",648,"bedroom yeah we know we can switch it","ep048"

"24942",654,"upstairs I have a surprise for y'all oh","ep048"
"24943",657,"look around when I saw the potential in","ep048"
"24944",660,"extra space upstairs to let my","ep048"
"24945",663,"creativity shine I got a little excited","ep048"
"24946",666,"I see insulation I see sawdust and a lot","ep048"
"24947",669,"of work the house had to start from","ep048"
"24948",672,"insulation in sawdust okay if we think","ep048"
"24949",675,"we need more space at least we have an","ep048"
"24950",678,"option yeah yeah there was a challenge","ep048"
"24951",681,"to me because it doesn't have a pool my","ep048"
"24952",684,"family does really need a pool but when","ep048"
"24953",687,"I walked up to the house the curb appeal","ep048"
"24954",690,"was nice it wasn't the Mediterranean","ep048"
"24955",693,"house that I was looking for but it","ep048"
"24956",696,"looked good to me so when I walked in","ep048"
"24957",699,"the door I was really happy and it felt","ep048"
"24958",702,"like home I really liked the idea of","ep048"
"24959",705,"working upstairs and creating our own","ep048"
"24960",708,"space and the price is right but the","ep048"
"24961",711,"location is just not working for me you","ep048"

"24976",756,"even squeeze in a pool but it just","ep048"

"24978",762,"Ksenia so today they're meeting their","ep048"
"24979",765,"agent scoler at a property that should","ep048"

"24982",774,"excited this is not a townhome or a","ep048"

"25019",885,"key to this house since the price point","ep048"

"25050",978,"family they head downstairs and outside","ep048"

"25070",1038,"well that's hard to argue with these","ep048"
"25071",1041,"views I think this could really work I","ep048"
"25072",1044,"guess I'm the only holdout because Tim's","ep048"
"25073",1047,"not sure they found the one they head","ep048"
"25074",1050,"out to see another option so this isn't","ep048"

"25090",1098,"kseniya thinks living right on the water","ep048"
"25091",1101,"is crucial so far they've seen a","ep048"
"25092",1104,"single-family home about a five-minute","ep048"
"25093",1107,"walk from the water it had a low price","ep048"
"25094",1110,"and space to add all the bedrooms he","ep048"
"25095",1113,"wants then their agents colleague showed","ep048"
"25096",1116,"them a four-bedroom penthouse right on","ep048"
"25097",1119,"the beach and right at the top of their","ep048"

"25100",1128,"lined up another option I don't see any","ep048"
"25101",1131,"sand Destin you're about a block from","ep048"
"25102",1134,"the beach you're not far at all here so","ep048"
"25103",1137,"this isn't a Mediterranean house this is","ep048"
"25104",1140,"a beach house I like it so what's the","ep048"
"25105",1143,"price 835,000 we're only missing the","ep048"
"25106",1146,"beach though I tried to find the best","ep048"
"25107",1149,"compromise house for them and I'm still","ep048"

"25122",1194,"is nice what do you think of that think","ep048"
"25123",1197,"I hate this sinking can this thing be","ep048"
"25124",1200,"older than the house","ep048"
"25125",1203,"the light is a little dated but at least","ep048"
"25126",1206,"it's not dark kitchen I think we can get","ep048"
"25127",1209,"away with just putting a new backsplash","ep048"
"25128",1212,"and definitely the things got to go and","ep048"
"25129",1215,"that's something that your dad can do I","ep048"

"25149",1275,"look in on another bedroom upstairs and","ep048"
"25150",1278,"bonus room before making their way to","ep048"
"25151",1281,"the back yard for a surprise","ep048"

"25547",768,"on paper it doesn't tick all the boxes","ep049"
"25548",771,"in reality I didn't care for the doors","ep049"

"25553",786,"never gonna be able to have the view","ep049"

"25557",798,"Randy halfway it's still a little bit","ep049"
"25558",801,"over budget oh come on it's not that","ep049"
"25559",804,"much over budget but I'm not sure about","ep049"
"25560",807,"that table don't care for the barstools","ep049"
"25561",810,"either of course that's the one thing I","ep049"
"25562",813,"really do like what do you think Lisa do","ep049"
"25563",816,"you like it","ep049"
"25564",819,"Susan and Randy are reconnecting in","ep049"
"25565",822,"Belize I would have to give him kudos","ep049"
"25566",825,"for living with me for 37 years","ep049"
"25567",828,"because I'm always causing trouble but","ep049"
"25568",831,"we make a pretty good team because I'll","ep049"
"25569",834,"push him yeah to get out of his comfort","ep049"
"25570",837,"zone and he will reign me back in it is","ep049"
"25571",840,"extremely important that we're able to","ep049"
"25572",843,"take our dogs with us donkey got you","ep049"
"25573",846,"ready to go for you new home they're not","ep049"

"25575",852,"the first time I went down there and","ep049"
"25576",855,"I'll zooming up the beach and one of the","ep049"
"25577",858,"locals looked at me says yo man you","ep049"
"25578",861,"Russian I said I'm not Russian","ep049"
"25579",864,"you looked at me said then what you","ep049"
"25580",867,"rushing for that's great","ep049"
"25581",870,"the main difference for us is he's so","ep049"
"25582",873,"budget conscious and I really don't care","ep049"
"25583",876,"too much about the budget but ambergris","ep049"
"25584",879,"he's tough rental market is giving them","ep049"
"25585",882,"a run for their money","ep049"
"25586",885,"the real estate market on ambergris key","ep049"
"25587",888,"is quite strong but our inventories are","ep049"
"25588",891,"dwindling quickly and I think that Randy","ep049"
"25589",894,"is scared about our ability to find a","ep049"
"25590",897,"unit that's gonna suit them in terms of","ep049"
"25591",900,"the budget and I feel the same way so","ep049"
"25592",903,"this is a three bedroom three and a half","ep049"
"25593",906,"bath","ep049"
"25594",909,"Wow it's a big one the list price of the","ep049"
"25595",912,"property is five hundred and twenty-five","ep049"
"25596",915,"thousand dollars Wow I don't care if","ep049"
"25597",918,"it's a little bit more expensive you're","ep049"
"25598",921,"gonna have to keep working into it that","ep049"
"25599",924,"wasn't part of the plan you know plans","ep049"
"25600",927,"change","ep049"
"25601",930,"house two is easier on Randy's budget","ep049"
"25602",933,"three hundred and seven 5,000 but I","ep049"
"25603",936,"don't like that view it's too closed off","ep049"
"25604",939,"we're never gonna be able to have the","ep049"
"25605",942,"view here that we have at the luxury","ep049"
"25606",945,"property how can you compare the two","ep049"
"25607",948,"money the only conflict I can see is","ep049"
"25608",951,"that Susan will get what she wants and","ep049"
"25609",954,"I'm not sure that that's conflict at all","ep049"
"25610",957,"Josh finally finds a place that could","ep049"
"25611",960,"meet Susan's high standards without","ep049"
"25612",963,"breaking the bank but getting there is","ep049"
"25613",966,"another thing the roads are generally","ep049"
"25614",969,"not great and when traveling in a golf","ep049"
"25615",972,"cart that can be tedious bumpy and not","ep049"
"25616",975,"always fun","ep049"
"25617",978,"their jobs where are you taking us yeah","ep049"
"25618",981,"so the entrance isn't perfect","ep049"
"25619",984,"very nice only ten units on two hundred","ep049"
"25620",987,"feet of beachfront Wow","ep049"
"25621",990,"the unit here is two-bedroom two-bath","ep049"
"25622",993,"and it's right there Wow and it's listed","ep049"
"25623",996,"at four hundred and sixty-five thousand","ep049"
"25624",999,"well it's still a little bit over budget","ep049"
"25625",1002,"oh come on it's not that much over","ep049"
"25626",1005,"budget Wow coming up those stairs every","ep049"
"25627",1008,"time I have to take the dogs out that's","ep049"
"25628",1011,"gonna be something Oh","ep049"
"25629",1014,"grandi look at the view who cares about","ep049"
"25630",1017,"the stupid steps everywhere you look","ep049"
"25631",1020,"windows windows windows but I'm not sure","ep049"
"25632",1023,"about this furniture what do you think","ep049"
"25633",1026,"yeah it's looks a little dated yes","ep049"
"25634",1029,"definitely not your style no I'm not","ep049"
"25635",1032,"sure about that table either that might","ep049"
"25636",1035,"have to be replaced","ep049"
"25637",1038,"I don't care for the barstools either I","ep049"
"25638",1041,"think I might have you remove this I","ep049"
"25639",1044,"don't like this we've never lived in a","ep049"
"25640",1047,"house where Susan hasn't begun","ep049"
"25641",1050,"remodeling almost immediately if we move","ep049"
"25642",1053,"in here we're gonna have to keep it as","ep049"
"25643",1056,"is for quite a while one thing that I","ep049"
"25644",1059,"really wanted to do is to be able to","ep049"
"25645",1062,"walk out on the veranda walk right down","ep049"
"25646",1065,"and be on the beachfront not with the","ep049"
"25647",1068,"pool first the beach is what 15 steps","ep049"
"25648",1071,"away get over it what do you think Lisa","ep049"
"25649",1074,"do you like it","ep049"
"25650",1077,"Lisa seems to like it okay could have a","ep049"
"25651",1080,"dance floor here you know how we like to","ep049"
"25652",1083,"dance okay master Oh straight in here","ep049"
"25653",1086,"like this look at that view can you","ep049"
"25654",1089,"imagine waking up to that every day is","ep049"
"25655",1092,"fantastic and I love the furniture in","ep049"
"25656",1095,"here so that'll save me some money oh my","ep049"
"25657",1098,"gosh the color","ep049"
"25658",1101,"holy mackerel is that bright we might","ep049"
"25659",1104,"want something different with that of","ep049"
"25660",1107,"course you wouldn't like the orange","ep049"
"25661",1110,"paint that's the one thing I really do","ep049"
"25662",1113,"like I know that's his favorite color","ep049"
"25663",1116,"but for a bathroom it's just too much","ep049"
"25664",1119,"well big I think it's a little dark and","ep049"
"25665",1122,"I'm not a big fan of the furniture I","ep049"
"25666",1125,"think we're gonna have to replace that","ep049"
"25667",1128,"let's take a look at the second bathroom","ep049"
"25668",1131,"so it's it's a nice size really wish it","ep049"
"25669",1134,"was ensuite","ep049"
"25670",1137,"yeah I do too but I guess we'll just","ep049"
"25671",1140,"have to buy bathrobes I don't think","ep049"
"25672",1143,"they're optimistic in terms of our","ep049"
"25673",1146,"ability to find a unit that's gonna suit","ep049"
"25674",1149,"them and they really have to make","ep049"
"25675",1152,"sacrifices and that's gonna be cost so I","ep049"
"25676",1155,"like this unit overall I am a little","ep049"
"25677",1158,"concerned about the steps four or five","ep049"
"25678",1161,"times a day with the dogs that's a lot","ep049"
"25679",1164,"the furnishings need to go they're old","ep049"
"25680",1167,"they're outdated already being over","ep049"
"25681",1170,"budget and now thinking about new","ep049"
"25682",1173,"furnishings that could be a deal-breaker","ep049"
"25683",1176,"for me I like it I like it if I don't I","ep049"
"25684",1179,"don't and I'm not gonna be as budget","ep049"
"25685",1182,"conscious so there you go budget man you","ep049"
"25686",1185,"know I love the luxury condo yeah my","ep049"
"25687",1188,"biggest concern is we're gonna be living","ep049"
"25688",1191,"off our savings and it's a little scary","ep049"
"25689",1194,"what","ep049"
"25690",1197,"Randy doesn't want to go over budget","ep049"
"25691",1200,"Susan couldn't care less it's really","ep049"
"25692",1203,"important that we stay within $400,000","ep049"
"25693",1206,"keep in mind that's his budget I don't","ep049"
"25694",1209,"the problem spending more money I never","ep049"
"25695",1212,"have and it would be impossible for us","ep049"
"25696",1215,"to go to Belize without our dogs you","ep049"
"25697",1218,"know they're part of our pack we're part","ep049"
"25698",1221,"of their pack and it just wouldn't","ep049"
"25699",1224,"happen if we couldn't take those dogs","ep049"
"25700",1227,"with us but the amount of available real","ep049"
"25701",1230,"estate on ambergris key is shrinking the","ep049"
"25702",1233,"real estate market on ambergris key is","ep049"
"25703",1236,"quite strong but our inventories are","ep049"
"25704",1239,"dwindling quickly you know I love the","ep049"
"25705",1242,"luxury I mean come on what's not to love","ep049"
"25706",1245,"about that","ep049"
"25707",1248,"I don't know where to look first the","ep049"
"25708",1251,"view the kitchen love it I don't care if","ep049"
"25709",1254,"it's a little bit more expensive my","ep049"
"25710",1257,"biggest concern is the budget we would","ep049"
"25711",1260,"probably spend more time together though","ep049"
"25712",1263,"because we wouldn't be able to go","ep049"
"25713",1266,"anywhere else","ep049"
"25714",1269,"house 2 is under budget three hundred","ep049"
"25715",1272,"and seven five thousand so we do have a","ep049"
"25716",1275,"little bit of money to spend not enough","ep049"
"25717",1278,"though I don't think I don't like that","ep049"
"25718",1281,"view it's too closed off did have three","ep049"
"25719",1284,"swimming pools and one for the dogs","ep049"
"25720",1287,"well that's very true house three is","ep049"
"25721",1290,"closer to budget but still not perfect","ep049"
"25722",1293,"I'm not sure about this furniture what","ep049"
"25723",1296,"do you think definitely not your style","ep049"
"25724",1299,"no that might have to be replaced Randy","ep049"
"25725",1302,"we've never lived in a house where Susan","ep049"
"25726",1305,"hasn't begun remodeling almost","ep049"
"25727",1308,"immediately I am concerned about the","ep049"
"25728",1311,"steps look at the view who cares about","ep049"
"25729",1314,"the stupid steps","ep049"
"25730",1317,"[Music]","ep049"
"25731",1320,"so we tried to eliminate one yeah I","ep049"
"25732",1323,"think we should probably eliminate","ep049"
"25733",1326,"something I need luxury condos beautiful","ep049"
"25734",1329,"but way over button yeah it was a lot","ep049"
"25735",1332,"I'll tell ya and even for me I don't","ep049"
"25736",1335,"want to have to spend all our money","ep049"
"25737",1338,"there and then there's no containment","ep049"
"25738",1341,"for the dogs man I think we need to","ep049"
"25739",1344,"eliminate that one I think we should go","ep049"
"25740",1347,"with the small community for a","ep049"

"25748",1371,"budget right but over the long term","ep049"
"25749",1374,"right that I don't think that's gonna","ep049"
"25750",1377,"make a big difference so what do you","ep049"
"25751",1380,"think of the large complex","ep049"
"25752",1383,"it had this beautiful view but I didn't","ep049"

"25874",264,"work out so I'm definitely gonna have to","ep050"
"25875",267,"find them a compromise property space","ep050"
"25876",270,"for Krystal the garage for Christian and","ep050"
"25877",273,"beyond budget I'm going to see this","ep050"

"25884",294,"nondescript furniture a bit of a","ep050"
"25885",297,"hotchpotch to be honest I'm fine with","ep050"
"25886",300,"the furniture of course you would say","ep050"
"25887",303,"that fetch them away we're not looking","ep050"

"25894",324,"kind of my domain Kristen really likes","ep050"
"25895",327,"the interior of the house I'm a bit","ep050"
"25896",330,"drawn because it doesn't have this","ep050"
"25897",333,"British feeling there is a fridge there","ep050"
"25898",336,"so we have the oven we have the fridge","ep050"

"25905",357,"this is strange what is this Oh now this","ep050"
"25906",360,"is part of the roof structure it makes","ep050"
"25907",363,"the room seem quite small actually cause","ep050"
"25908",366,"it kind of takes away half of the room","ep050"
"25909",369,"that's it I think this is plenty of","ep050"
"25910",372,"space for a bedroom now this is the","ep050"
"25911",375,"second bedroom as you can see it's set","ep050"
"25912",378,"up as an office all we really need it","ep050"
"25913",381,"was an office it's pretty light and","ep050"
"25914",384,"spacious kind of workplace I like that","ep050"
"25915",387,"about it it's a fairly big bathroom it","ep050"
"25916",390,"has a bathtub and it's got some shelf","ep050"
"25917",393,"space here I see which is nice for all","ep050"
"25918",396,"my stuff it's very interesting to learn","ep050"
"25919",399,"more and more about crystal now I","ep050"
"25920",402,"realized she's really looking for","ep050"
"25921",405,"something modern and I wanted something","ep050"
"25922",408,"cozy a bit more old-school so Christian","ep050"
"25923",411,"can you see yourself in here a tinkering","ep050"
"25924",414,"on your classic cars honestly the garage","ep050"
"25925",417,"is a bit small I struggle a bit to see","ep050"
"25926",420,"where put my stuff and how I can make it","ep050"
"25927",423,"a nice workshop Christian you know he","ep050"
"25928",426,"really wanted the garage and now it's a","ep050"
"25929",429,"garage and he's kind of not really happy","ep050"
"25930",432,"about it","ep050"
"25931",435,"so I think he's gonna need a little","ep050"
"25932",438,"a reality check tell me what you think","ep050"
"25933",441,"about the prophecy overall it is modern","ep050"
"25934",444,"for me but at the same time it's not","ep050"
"25935",447,"very spacious the garage is not perfect","ep050"
"25936",450,"it's a bit small in my mind","ep050"
"25937",453,"unfortunately the property didn't","ep050"
"25938",456,"deliver traditional kind of character","ep050"
"25939",459,"and charm I was looking for I really","ep050"
"25940",462,"want to see property which has crystals","ep050"
"25941",465,"thresholds and see whether I can push","ep050"
"25942",468,"the compromise on my side of it I feel a","ep050"
"25943",471,"bit torn between the two of them really","ep050"
"25944",474,"this is about this new issue and they","ep050"
"25945",477,"need us to meld their desires together","ep050"
"25946",480,"really into something that's going to be","ep050"
"25947",483,"achievable now how is this for a garage","ep050"
"25948",486,"Christian I think we don't have to see","ep050"
"25949",489,"another property you're gonna have to","ep050"
"25950",492,"sleep out here when we fight I'm","ep050"
"25951",495,"guessing that's a bet that's the bedroom","ep050"
"25952",498,"moment the house was surprisingly cute","ep050"
"25953",501,"know this I'm a little bit worried about","ep050"
"25954",504,"you two living together in Northampton","ep050"
"25955",507,"England amateur car rally drivers","ep050"
"25956",510,"Bristol and Christian are looking for a","ep050"
"25957",513,"house and they're moving or fast I was","ep050"
"25958",516,"in a car rally and I was driving from","ep050"
"25959",519,"England to Mongolia and along the way I","ep050"
"25960",522,"met Christian and we're a couple for two","ep050"

"25964",534,"of exploring the world I was not a","ep050"
"25965",537,"commitment person I couldn't even commit","ep050"
"25966",540,"to a country I thought it's time to let","ep050"
"25967",543,"you out in the world and I arranged a","ep050"
"25968",546,"little team it's very fancy to have to","ep050"
"25969",549,"do the air kinky now it's just try to","ep050"
"25970",552,"look a bit posh I'm going for it sorry","ep050"
"25971",555,"look I'm definitely not posh is it easy","ep050"
"25972",558,"to tell yes today they're discovering","ep050"
"25973",561,"that the first blush of love doesn't","ep050"
"25974",564,"guarantee they'll agree on everything","ep050"
"25975",567,"when we got to know each other we found","ep050"
"25976",570,"out we're soul mates","ep050"
"25977",573,"pretty quickly but we never had our","ep050"
"25978",576,"domestic life Christian is the opposite","ep050"
"25979",579,"of me whereas I'm kind of spontaneous he","ep050"
"25980",582,"thinks things through and after seeing","ep050"
"25981",585,"only one property","ep050"
"25982",588,"yeah those differences are coming to the","ep050"
"25983",591,"surface oh there we go that's actually a","ep050"
"25984",594,"very modern fit why think sterile I'm","ep050"
"25985",597,"fine with the furniture of course you","ep050"
"25986",600,"would say that catch the boy","ep050"
"25987",603,"there isn't a dishwasher well there is","ep050"
"25988",606,"dishwasher because I brought one","ep050"
"25989",609,"and his name is Christian Oh my biggest","ep050"
"25990",612,"challenge is trying to marry the need","ep050"
"25991",615,"for a nice big garage with a nice space","ep050"
"25992",618,"and two bedrooms they're gonna have to","ep050"
"25993",621,"make some tricky decisions so we're","ep050"
"25994",624,"coming up to our next property now it's","ep050"
"25995",627,"a really nice traditional English","ep050"
"25996",630,"property there we go now how is this for","ep050"
"25997",633,"a garage Christian I think we don't have","ep050"
"25998",636,"to see another property what we've got","ep050"
"25999",639,"here is a 1-bed 1-bath farmhouse just","ep050"

"26008",666,"so come on through","ep050"
"26009",669,"Oh oh my what do you think okay it's","ep050"
"26010",672,"super British this house is older than","ep050"
"26011",675,"my country I guess the house just feels","ep050"
"26012",678,"lovely it's very cozy a lot of woods and","ep050"
"26013",681,"beams and stuff so I really enjoy being","ep050"

"26032",738,"Kristian here on his own he would just","ep050"
"26033",741,"totally overlook the home aspect and","ep050"
"26034",744,"just see he looks at things for","ep050"
"26035",747,"functionality and not necessarily what's","ep050"

"26352",321,"walking into a house I hate seeing","ep051"
"26353",324,"closed off rooms an updated kitchen","ep051"

"26359",342,"crawl on the carpet I don't get that the","ep051"
"26360",345,"children thing will throw a few area","ep051"

"26372",381,"the front porch hey guys how are you","ep051"
"26373",384,"yeah I see you guys critiquing nice","ep051"
"26374",387,"already huh yeah okay no problem I","ep051"
"26375",390,"understand it is their first home it's","ep051"
"26376",393,"the biggest investment they're gonna","ep051"
"26377",396,"make so you want to make sure you make","ep051"
"26378",399,"them happy no matter what it takes","ep051"
"26379",402,"so this is a colonial as you can see I","ep051"
"26380",405,"really like that it's a colonial square","ep051"
"26381",408,"footage about 1700","ep051"
"26382",411,"so that is pretty ample space 3-bedroom","ep051"
"26383",414,"2bath and a price about 329 okay let's","ep051"
"26384",417,"go inside I was more looking for a","ep051"
"26385",420,"split-level house but I guess we'll see","ep051"
"26386",423,"what it has inside I actually like that","ep051"
"26387",426,"because it kind of reminds me of a house","ep051"
"26388",429,"will be just so much as soon as you walk","ep051"
"26389",432,"in I don't love that the stairs are as","ep051"
"26390",435,"soon as you walk in that's kind of a","ep051"
"26391",438,"turn-off for me but it looks like","ep051"
"26392",441,"there's wood floor so that seems like a","ep051"
"26393",444,"plus looks like the floor follows in","ep051"
"26394",447,"here that's nice","ep051"
"26395",450,"this is a weird area though it's almost","ep051"
"26396",453,"like they enclosed the old porch so far","ep051"
"26397",456,"the layout doesn't look as open as I was","ep051"
"26398",459,"hoping it would be so maybe might have","ep051"
"26399",462,"to take some walls down I like the","ep051"
"26400",465,"fireplace though you do every nice is","ep051"
"26401",468,"that fake brick Wow look at this it's","ep051"
"26402",471,"wallpaper really that's really weird","ep051"
"26403",474,"that's weird it's all fake okay let's","ep051"
"26404",477,"follow into the dining room now looks","ep051"
"26405",480,"like looks like some more hardwood","ep051"
"26406",483,"floors here yeah I mean I'm not a big","ep051"
"26407",486,"fan of floors but I actually don't mind","ep051"
"26408",489,"needs to smush they're nice and original","ep051"
"26409",492,"and I like that I was pretty surprised","ep051"
"26410",495,"that he liked the hardwood floor in the","ep051"
"26411",498,"house if we refinish it I think it could","ep051"
"26412",501,"be a good compromise this rooms a little","ep051"
"26413",504,"small for a dining area though I mean if","ep051"
"26414",507,"we put a table in here there's not gonna","ep051"
"26415",510,"be any room to walk around yeah it's","ep051"
"26416",513,"very small and what is that fit oh my","ep051"
"26417",516,"god it's all of carpet it's terrible","ep051"
"26418",519,"look so old even if you want to keep","ep051"
"26419",522,"carpet in here we're gonna have to get","ep051"
"26420",525,"new carpet you have the same this is an","ep051"
"26421",528,"older house but of course is the older","ep051"
"26422",531,"house you got to expect more repairs","ep051"
"26423",534,"maybe some comments on this home that","ep051"
"26424",537,"it's old that's enough space for them","ep051"
"26425",540,"but it is a colonial it isn't patch oh","ep051"
"26426",543,"that's also Plus this home but they have","ep051"

"26430",555,"would never cook anything in there I","ep051"
"26431",558,"think it's so cool maybe we could just","ep051"
"26432",561,"bring this to an antique shop it would","ep051"
"26433",564,"take an act of God to get stuff to cook","ep051"
"26434",567,"on the stove these cabinets are weird","ep051"
"26435",570,"too I don't really like these the window","ep051"

"26441",588,"guys","ep051"
"26442",591,"follow me this is a nice little porch","ep051"
"26443",594,"area I could see us sitting out here","ep051"
"26444",597,"maybe in the morning with some coffee or","ep051"
"26445",600,"something","ep051"
"26446",603,"it's all so peaceful guys if you don't","ep051"
"26447",606,"know if you notice we've seen some","ep051"
"26448",609,"houses in the past where you know it was","ep051"
"26449",612,"very noisy you can see it's really quiet","ep051"
"26450",615,"right now such as a plus back inside","ep051"
"26451",618,"they look in on the main floor bathroom","ep051"
"26452",621,"not quite the full bath I was hoping for","ep051"
"26453",624,"just not really our style where you do","ep051"
"26454",627,"have two full baths which is a huge huge","ep051"
"26455",630,"plus yeah first place you're gonna see","ep051"
"26456",633,"one and a half as a powder room but here","ep051"
"26457",636,"and again it's definitely worth","ep051"
"26458",639,"something workable for you guys yeah","ep051"
"26459",642,"something that can actually work they","ep051"
"26460",645,"head upstairs to see the bedrooms an","ep051"
"26461",648,"additional bathroom Wow","ep051"
"26462",651,"geez holy 80s all needs to be redone I","ep051"
"26463",654,"mean the pink countertop in cabinets to","ep051"

"26465",660,"couldn't pay me to get inside of that","ep051"
"26466",663,"tub I like the carpet","ep051"
"26467",666,"I hate the carpet maybe we could rip","ep051"
"26468",669,"this up and put a nice area rug down","ep051"
"26469",672,"instead no I like the cockpit of course","ep051"
"26470",675,"that hates the carpet just scuse me out","ep051"
"26471",678,"I wouldn't rather replace it or at least","ep051"
"26472",681,"put some hardwood in shall we look at","ep051"
"26473",684,"the closet sure yes let's go","ep051"
"26474",687,"all right doubt is a walk-in and it's","ep051"
"26475",690,"not so there's no master bathroom no","ep051"
"26476",693,"there is not a master bathroom I guess","ep051"
"26477",696,"[Music]","ep051"
"26478",699,"so guys what do you thoughts on this","ep051"
"26479",702,"home I really I really like the backyard","ep051"
"26480",705,"I didn't like that there wasn't any","ep051"
"26481",708,"master bathroom though yeah that's","ep051"
"26482",711,"that's something we definitely wanted","ep051"
"26483",714,"but you do have two floor best which is","ep051"
"26484",717,"a huge huge plus the upside for the","ep051"
"26485",720,"bathroom would be that we don't have to","ep051"
"26486",723,"share the bathroom when we're getting","ep051"
"26487",726,"ready in the morning they both tend to","ep051"
"26488",729,"get ready at the same time for work so","ep051"
"26489",732,"having that extra shower would really be","ep051"
"26490",735,"helpful I really didn't like the kitchen","ep051"
"26491",738,"at all I think it needs to be gutted","ep051"
"26492",741,"completely I really like that of it I","ep051"
"26493",744,"hope we can keep that over I hope not I","ep051"
"26494",747,"love that most of its hardwood floor","ep051"
"26495",750,"that's nice too I was more looking for a","ep051"
"26496",753,"split-level house so since Ray prefers","ep051"
"26497",756,"split-levels Antonio's lined one up but","ep051"
"26498",759,"they'll have to compromise on bathrooms","ep051"
"26499",762,"it's a three bedroom one and a half","ep051"
"26500",765,"[Music]","ep051"
"26501",768,"maybe we'll find a house get that done","ep051"
"26502",771,"and then we can move on to the","ep051"
"26503",774,"engagement party fiancees ray and","ep051"
"26504",777,"Stephanie are keen to leave their","ep051"
"26505",780,"parents homes and begin married life but","ep051"
"26506",783,"first they need to find a house they","ep051"
"26507",786,"know they want to stay near family and","ep051"
"26508",789,"Patchogue but with three hundred and","ep051"
"26509",792,"twenty thousand dollars they still can't","ep051"
"26510",795,"agree on what they want to buy so far","ep051"
"26511",798,"they've seen a 1,700 square foot","ep051"
"26512",801,"colonial with two full baths and a front","ep051"
"26513",804,"porch for Stephanie but the kitchen and","ep051"
"26514",807,"baths were dated and it came with a","ep051"
"26515",810,"price tag over their budget so real","ep051"
"26516",813,"estate agent Antonio is hoping a lower","ep051"
"26517",816,"price point combined with Ray's","ep051"
"26518",819,"preferred split-level style will hit the","ep051"
"26519",822,"mark only issue it's 15 minutes farther","ep051"
"26520",825,"out in Medford this is nice house yeah I","ep051"
"26521",828,"like the color nice piece of property","ep051"
"26522",831,"also but I don't know about the drive","ep051"
"26523",834,"it's gonna take me even longer to get to","ep051"
"26524",837,"work yeah I know this is a little far","ep051"
"26525",840,"from what we wanted okay guys just a","ep051"
"26526",843,"little bit different this is more like a","ep051"
"26527",846,"split-level this is a split-level house","ep051"
"26528",849,"is this plate loud looks like a ranch I","ep051"
"26529",852,"know it doesn't in the back it actually","ep051"
"26530",855,"tips up so you I should have more room","ep051"
"26531",858,"in the back it's a three bedroom one and","ep051"
"26532",861,"a half priced at 289,000 and it's","ep051"
"26533",864,"completely remodeled nothing a price","ep051"
"26534",867,"range so maybe you know the distance","ep051"
"26535",870,"from work won't be that bad I don't","ep051"
"26536",873,"really know that there's anything I","ep051"
"26537",876,"could change my mind about the different","ep051"
"26538",879,"commute it just would add on a lot of","ep051"
"26539",882,"time okay it's nice yeah it's pretty","ep051"
"26540",885,"nice I like the floors","ep051"
"26541",888,"they look like original too and they","ep051"
"26542",891,"would just read you know resurface them","ep051"
"26543",894,"look at your loom looks so big right did","ep051"
"26544",897,"you have such a high cathedral ceiling","ep051"
"26545",900,"yeah it gives you a lot of space looks","ep051"
"26546",903,"and give that impression it's as usual","ep051"
"26547",906,"okay in the kitchen all right I like the","ep051"
"26548",909,"floors a lot yeah it's actually really","ep051"
"26549",912,"nice it's different think you could fit","ep051"
"26550",915,"like a table over there two of the","ep051"
"26551",918,"corner yeah that's why I only it's","ep051"
"26552",921,"another note I don't like is that it you","ep051"
"26553",924,"don't have a dining room oh there is no","ep051"
"26554",927,"dining room","ep051"
"26555",930,"no this is called it basic kitchen","ep051"
"26556",933,"dining room combo usually you put a","ep051"
"26557",936,"dining room table right here and that","ep051"
"26558",939,"would pretty much serve the purpose or","ep051"
"26559",942,"you can do the dining room down there","ep051"
"26560",945,"and your keys downstairs as well vice","ep051"
"26561",948,"versa being that the kitchen is not open","ep051"
"26562",951,"I think it would be kind of hard to be","ep051"
"26563",954,"able to host people and have friends and","ep051"
"26564",957,"family","ep051"
"26565",960,"/ okay come on yeah so what would this","ep051"
"26566",963,"be is this supposed to be a bedroom this","ep051"
"26567",966,"you can make it into a den probably a","ep051"
"26568",969,"living room dining room upstairs it's a","ep051"
"26569",972,"little small for a living room","ep051"
"26570",975,"[Music]","ep051"
"26571",978,"definitely little smokes but this is a","ep051"
"26572",981,"nice window it's very smaller but there","ep051"
"26573",984,"is a bathroom that is nice to have down","ep051"
"26574",987,"here a little small though just you know","ep051"
"26575",990,"a toilet and I think that's all you","ep051"
"26576",993,"really need for a guest but yeah at","ep051"
"26577",996,"least you enough to go upstairs if you","ep051"
"26578",999,"have to go while you're down here so","ep051"
"26579",1002,"this doesn't actually count toward the","ep051"
"26580",1005,"bedrooms of the house no it's his actual","ep051"
"26581",1008,"space is what this says you still have","ep051"
"26582",1011,"three more bedrooms up top and you still","ep051"
"26583",1014,"have another bathroom okay you know I do","ep051"
"26584",1017,"like having a carpet it's I'm not a fan","ep051"
"26585",1020,"of it I really enjoy the carpet I hope","ep051"
"26586",1023,"it's in the bedroom but I'm happy that","ep051"
"26587",1026,"this carpet down here also okay guys","ep051"
"26588",1029,"this take a look outside it's a good","ep051"
"26589",1032,"size property yeah it's actually pretty","ep051"
"26590",1035,"nice yeah it's nice because we have a","ep051"
"26591",1038,"little bit of a side wall instead of","ep051"
"26592",1041,"just a backyard deck out here I mean it","ep051"
"26593",1044,"could use some work yeah it's definitely","ep051"
"26594",1047,"gonna it's gonna have to be redone back","ep051"
"26595",1050,"inside there are two guest bedrooms","ep051"
"26596",1053,"upstairs leading to the master so not","ep051"
"26597",1056,"much bigger no this is not big at all","ep051"
"26598",1059,"this is what I would want my smallest","ep051"
"26599",1062,"bedroom to be let's take a look at the","ep051"
"26600",1065,"bath bathrooms nice yeah this is","ep051"
"26601",1068,"probably the nicest part of the house","ep051"
"26602",1071,"yeah I really like it the tile is like","ep051"
"26603",1074,"really nice in here okay since we wanted","ep051"
"26604",1077,"the ensuite bed maybe we could just put","ep051"
"26605",1080,"a hole yeah you know door that goes","ep051"
"26606",1083,"through it's unfortunate that there is","ep051"
"26607",1086,"no ensuite master bath in the house it's","ep051"
"26608",1089,"something that we've really been looking","ep051"
"26609",1092,"for but I mean if we can cut that wall","ep051"
"26610",1095,"and make an opening there I don't think","ep051"
"26611",1098,"it would be too bad it's a good","ep051"
"26612",1101,"workaround","ep051"
"26613",1104,"[Music]","ep051"
"26614",1107,"what are your thoughts it was nice seein","ep051"
"26615",1110,"a split-level you know we saw the","ep051"
"26616",1113,"colonial and I needed a lot of work this","ep051"
"26617",1116,"is really more turnkey for us the little","ep051"
"26618",1119,"things we had to do is not a big deal","ep051"
"26619",1122,"because of the price point of the house","ep051"
"26620",1125,"so you know it's so affordable for us","ep051"
"26621",1128,"it's definitely not a colonial the","ep051"
"26622",1131,"kitchen we really wouldn't have to spend","ep051"
"26623",1134,"any money on because everything was","ep051"
"26624",1137,"really updated but then you have the","ep051"
"26625",1140,"lack of space for a dining area and","ep051"

"26645",1200,"Patchogue with the two bathrooms they","ep051"
"26646",1203,"want but it was pricey and needed work","ep051"
"26647",1206,"then they looked at a less expensive","ep051"
"26648",1209,"move-in-ready split-level with just one","ep051"
"26649",1212,"and a half baths they liked the big yard","ep051"
"26650",1215,"and main bathroom but the homes location","ep051"

"26712",1401,"having to share it with guests that are","ep051"
"26713",1404,"staying over that's not at least could","ep051"

"26726",1443,"it but we'll throw some area rugs down","ep051"
"26727",1446,"and he'll be fine","ep051"
"26728",1449,"the fact that I haven't seen any carpet","ep051"

"26735",1470,"carpet in the bedrooms only really","ep051"
"26736",1473,"wanted them you know a master bathroom","ep051"
"26737",1476,"ensuite so that's a little small at the","ep051"
"26738",1479,"end of the day let's tell you don't","ep051"
"26739",1482,"think about it it is it's a big","ep051"
"26740",1485,"investment I want to make sure you guys","ep051"

"26743",1494,"offer the dated colonial with two baths","ep051"
"26744",1497,"the split level or the move-in-ready","ep051"
"26745",1500,"smaller colonial definite have a lot to","ep051"
"26746",1503,"think about yeah I think so eager to get","ep051"
"26747",1506,"out of their parents homes and into one","ep051"
"26748",1509,"of their own fiance's ray and Stephanie","ep051"
"26749",1512,"are ready to decide on a house it's","ep051"
"26750",1515,"about time you guys so make a good","ep051"
"26751",1518,"decision","ep051"
"26752",1521,"yeah so make it soon yeah 3:29 what did","ep051"
"26753",1524,"you think about that one I thought it","ep051"
"26754",1527,"was pretty nice size definitely needed a","ep051"
"26755",1530,"lot of work too and it's already over","ep051"
"26756",1533,"budget and there was no open layout","ep051"
"26757",1536,"either yeah it was three bedrooms and","ep051"
"26758",1539,"two baths which is what we wanted in the","ep051"
"26759",1542,"house I did have a lot of hard one I'm","ep051"
"26760",1545,"not a big fan of hardwood there was some","ep051"
"26761",1548,"carpet too so I guess that would be a","ep051"
"26762",1551,"good compromise","ep051"
"26763",1554,"I hated that fireplace yeah I mean it","ep051"
"26764",1557,"wasn't even a fireplace so I don't know","ep051"
"26765",1560,"if we could even call it that what do","ep051"
"26766",1563,"you think about the split 11 4 289 I","ep051"
"26767",1566,"don't love that it's a split-level I","ep051"
"26768",1569,"know you probably like that though yeah","ep051"
"26769",1572,"I did really love the hardwood floors","ep051"
"26770",1575,"though throughout most of the house that","ep051"
"26771",1578,"was great yeah I feel like the kitchen","ep051"
"26772",1581,"was really nice yeah I love the kitchen","ep051"
"26773",1584,"and that master bath upstairs if we","ep051"
"26774",1587,"could just add that door that'd be great","ep051"
"26775",1590,"one thing I really enjoyed about that","ep051"
"26776",1593,"house was the price it was really really","ep051"
"26777",1596,"far under our budget which is really","ep051"
"26778",1599,"great but then the location I'd have to","ep051"
"26779",1602,"switch my route what do you think about","ep051"
"26780",1605,"that farmhouse colonial for three","ep051"
"26781",1608,"seventeen five I like that house had a","ep051"
"26782",1611,"lot of character I think it might be a","ep051"
"26783",1614,"little too small for what I was looking","ep051"
"26784",1617,"for it was pretty much turnkey which is","ep051"
"26785",1620,"nice and the hardwood floors are great","ep051"
"26786",1623,"in there too yeah I know there's no","ep051"
"26787",1626,"carpet but I mean like I do like the","ep051"
"26788",1629,"character that the hardwood floors bring","ep051"
"26789",1632,"so yeah I really like that a lot too","ep051"
"26790",1635,"there's not really","ep051"
"26791",1638,"openly out we're looking for in the","ep051"
"26792",1641,"kitchen either yeah take someone to","ep051"
"26793",1644,"knock that wall down it would cost a lot","ep051"
"26794",1647,"of money to take a wall down and the","ep051"
"26795",1650,"shared driveway that really bothers me","ep051"
"26796",1653,"sharing the driveway with the next-door","ep051"
"26797",1656,"neighbor I can tell you which one I want","ep051"
"26798",1659,"let me guess the phone I was calling you","ep051"
"26799",1662,"yeah I really love that house no I'd","ep051"
"26800",1665,"actually like that house too I think it","ep051"
"26801",1668,"was pretty good for what we need had so","ep051"
"26802",1671,"much charm and character yeah definitely","ep051"
"26803",1674,"and it needed no work no location I'll","ep051"
"26804",1677,"be great too yeah perfect I'd really","ep051"
"26805",1680,"love to put the couch along that wall","ep051"
"26806",1683,"there and there may be a little corner","ep051"
"26807",1686,"unit here with the TV it a beam eyes me","ep051"
"26808",1689,"we chose the farmhouse colonial listed","ep051"
"26809",1692,"317 five we paid 320 which is right at","ep051"
"26810",1695,"the top of our budget we actually","ep051"
"26811",1698,"haven't been living in the house yet","ep051"
"26812",1701,"we're just working on moving our stuff","ep051"
"26813",1704,"in that's close yeah more clothes for","ep051"
"26814",1707,"the bedroom we have a little bit of work","ep051"
"26815",1710,"to do we want to paint I think the dark","ep051"
"26816",1713,"paint with the white paneling and then","ep051"
"26817",1716,"if we do it on the beams up there I","ep051"
"26818",1719,"think it'll look really good","ep051"
"26819",1722,"someone in the near future we want to","ep051"
"26820",1725,"demo a wall in between the kitchen and","ep051"
"26821",1728,"the dining room the other day I spoke","ep051"
"26822",1731,"with the contractor this is actually all","ep051"
"26823",1734,"brick under here are you kidding we","ep051"
"26824",1737,"punched a little hole in it you can","ep051"
"26825",1740,"actually see the brick in there I guess","ep051"
"26826",1743,"it could be cool if we expose the brick","ep051"
"26827",1746,"and then put some high-top chairs here","ep051"
"26828",1749,"and made this like a little eating area","ep051"
"26829",1752,"yeah I think that would be pretty nice","ep051"
"26830",1755,"our family has grown a little bit since","ep051"

"26930",267,"the kitchen has to be updated I don't","ep052"

"26953",336,"ya know I like it's a little bit more","ep052"
"26954",339,"open and I would expect okay","ep052"
"26955",342,"the sinks a little rough though and","ep052"
"26956",345,"where do you even start with a fair","ep052"
"26957",348,"writer for Spanish why that's why we're","ep052"
"26958",351,"here","ep052"
"26959",354,"this view is a little strange","ep052"
"26960",357,"pretty typical of this kind of apartment","ep052"
"26961",360,"block to have this interior space which","ep052"
"26962",363,"is pretty useless really it looks like a","ep052"
"26963",366,"rat's escape hatch we can get this is","ep052"
"26964",369,"the washer/dryer no I'm sorry just a","ep052"
"26965",372,"washer okay the kitchen opens up into","ep052"
"26966",375,"the lounge dining area I love how open","ep052"
"26967",378,"it is and I love the exposed brick and","ep052"
"26968",381,"the ceilings are absolutely gorgeous","ep052"
"26969",384,"yeah this is famous charm what do you","ep052"
"26970",387,"think about the size it's smaller than","ep052"
"26971",390,"what I'm looking for as far as being","ep052"
"26972",393,"able to work out and practice swinging","ep052"
"26973",396,"up and down definitely but I'm just not","ep052"
"26974",399,"sure if it's gonna be wide enough I'm","ep052"
"26975",402,"really worried I'm gonna swing a piece","ep052"
"26976",405,"of metal and take a chunk out of a wall","ep052"
"26977",408,"or knock down a lighting fixture you","ep052"
"26978",411,"have a lovely view of the courtyard","ep052"
"26979",414,"that's where I guess you would hang up","ep052"
"26980",417,"her lunch ah right","ep052"
"26981",420,"that'll be something that we would","ep052"
"26982",423,"definitely have to get used to all right","ep052"
"26983",426,"for me I feel like this is a big space","ep052"
"26984",429,"so this could be holding his bedroom but","ep052"
"26985",432,"I know he does not agree yeah because","ep052"
"26986",435,"she's fixated on location it could be a","ep052"
"26987",438,"dumpster but if it was located in a","ep052"
"26988",441,"really great place I think we might move","ep052"
"26989",444,"into it by the end of the week I will","ep052"
"26990",447,"say the one thing is there's not really","ep052"
"26991",450,"a whole lot of light and only the one","ep052"
"26992",453,"window so you get the same view of the","ep052"
"26993",456,"pipes oh I love this brick wall yeah","ep052"
"26994",459,"this is really pretty hallway and this","ep052"
"26995",462,"is the bathroom okay it's good size oh","ep052"
"26996",465,"we got a tub gotta be good for the baby","ep052"
"26997",468,"and a bidet don't bathe the baby in the","ep052"
"26998",471,"bidet please try not to so this is the","ep052"
"26999",474,"master bedroom","ep052"
"27000",477,"oh it's huge yeah I think this like how","ep052"
"27001",480,"the beams and the brick wall go through","ep052"
"27002",483,"the whole house yeah there's a lot of","ep052"
"27003",486,"character throughout this is the little","ep052"
"27004",489,"Terrace","ep052"
"27005",492,"that's definitely not huge but enough","ep052"
"27006",495,"room just sits well you know I was","ep052"
"27007",498,"really hoping for outside workout space","ep052"
"27008",501,"for me the location is absolutely","ep052"
"27009",504,"amazing","ep052"
"27010",507,"100% hits what I jumped about before we","ep052"
"27011",510,"moved here we can walk to work walk to","ep052"
"27012",513,"the studio the park is down the street","ep052"
"27013",516,"some of the things are a little outdated","ep052"
"27014",519,"the kitchen's a little bit older but","ep052"
"27015",522,"tons of character so it pretty well hits","ep052"
"27016",525,"my must-haves I don't know what about","ep052"
"27017",528,"you with this size living room work or","ep052"
"27018",531,"not the room is still a little bit","ep052"
"27019",534,"smaller I think than what I like Jen","ep052"
"27020",537,"will be in the apartment as much as","ep052"
"27021",540,"holton and I will be so I'm really like","ep052"
"27022",543,"to see a much larger space we'll see I","ep052"
"27023",546,"feel like it might be challenging for","ep052"
"27024",549,"the budget in the next property really","ep052"
"27025",552,"cool outdoor space or go far and","ep052"
"27026",555,"impressing me look at this oh my god is","ep052"
"27027",558,"incredible I'm a only concern is we'd","ep052"
"27028",561,"have to figure out how to baby-proof","ep052"
"27029",564,"that's terrifying","ep052"
"27030",567,"[Music]","ep052"
"27031",570,"Marty loved life in Austin Texas he got","ep052"
"27032",573,"married we had a child there mrs. Holton","ep052"
"27033",576,"ha","ep052"
"27034",579,"but when Jen accepted an offer abroad he","ep052"
"27035",582,"knew it was a risk worth taking","ep052"
"27036",585,"that's something we've always talked","ep052"
"27037",588,"about doing living in another country","ep052"
"27038",591,"and moving to Spain I think it's forging","ep052"
"27039",594,"our relationship into something more","ep052"
"27040",597,"powerful and I don't want to give up on","ep052"
"27041",600,"that opportunity but one of the things","ep052"
"27042",603,"great is that I'll be able to focus more","ep052"
"27043",606,"on sword fighting and fighting in some","ep052"
"27044",609,"tournaments that I might not have been","ep052"
"27045",612,"able to have a chance to a fight in the","ep052"
"27046",615,"United States what about your house did","ep052"
"27047",618,"your fondant no we're still looking","ep052"
"27048",621,"right now so as I think about our new","ep052"
"27049",624,"life in Barcelona for me location isn't","ep052"
"27050",627,"the biggest I'm gonna fight on that one","ep052"
"27051",630,"but he's gonna be staying at home with","ep052"
"27052",633,"me he's so good so finding a big enough","ep052"
"27053",636,"space that begins bring a sword in an","ep052"
"27054",639,"apartment in the middle of Barcelona","ep052"
"27055",642,"that's stressing me out a little bit to","ep052"
"27056",645,"be honest there's no quarrel when it","ep052"
"27057",648,"comes to house ones location how far","ep052"
"27058",651,"does it for my office a 10 minute walk","ep052"
"27059",654,"Oh amazing man how close is it to the","ep052"
"27060",657,"studio 10 minute walk as well but Marty","ep052"
"27061",660,"raises a flag about square footage I","ep052"
"27062",663,"think it's gonna be too small as far as","ep052"
"27063",666,"being able to work out I'm really","ep052"
"27064",669,"worried I'm gonna take a chunk out of a","ep052"
"27065",672,"wall all right so a bit more space maybe","ep052"
"27066",675,"just swing the sword yeah and definitely","ep052"
"27067",678,"hoping for outside workout space with","ep052"
"27068",681,"that budget they have to sacrifice","ep052"
"27069",684,"something so the next one I'm going to","ep052"
"27070",687,"show them some","ep052"
"27071",690,"that maybe doesn't have as much Spanish","ep052"
"27072",693,"character but it has a lot more size","ep052"
"27073",696,"light outside space and the modern","ep052"
"27074",699,"conveniences I love this little","ep052"
"27075",702,"courtyard it's really charming yeah","ep052"
"27076",705,"there's a lot of stuff here so what","ep052"
"27077",708,"actually is this area is there Chandler","ep052"
"27078",711,"but you have Gracia right next door it's","ep052"
"27079",714,"a very quiet little in clave in the","ep052"
"27080",717,"middle of it all yeah it's such a neat","ep052"
"27081",720,"little pocket of the city but not as","ep052"
"27082",723,"much history as the last neighborhood","ep052"
"27083",726,"that we looked at it's still beautiful","ep052"
"27084",729,"though it is actually further for you to","ep052"
"27085",732,"walk to your studio though it's gonna be","ep052"
"27086",735,"about 25 30 minute walk for you okay","ep052"
"27087",738,"that might be a little tough carrying","ep052"
"27088",741,"all the gear and stuff like that okay","ep052"
"27089",744,"and this is the apartment here it has","ep052"
"27090",747,"two bedrooms one and a half bathrooms","ep052"
"27091",750,"and is 1,600 ok so right it kind of the","ep052"
"27092",753,"max we'll definitely have to keep that","ep052"
"27093",756,"in mind we're checking it out here we","ep052"
"27094",759,"are whether in the kitchen oh wow this","ep052"
"27095",762,"is huge look at all the counter space","ep052"
"27096",765,"that's the dishwasher that's a","ep052"
"27097",768,"dishwasher yeah and a bigger fridge much","ep052"
"27098",771,"bigger fridge no that's amazing","ep052"
"27099",774,"I don't think I could ask for a better","ep052"
"27100",777,"kitchen so I'm gonna show you the","ep052"
"27101",780,"washer/dryer what you think yeah you","ep052"
"27102",783,"found it I found one yes one definitely","ep052"
"27103",786,"a bonus having a baby and doing laundry","ep052"
"27104",789,"all the time would make our lives easier","ep052"
"27105",792,"and I won't have to learn how to iron so","ep052"
"27106",795,"this is the living dining area all right","ep052"
"27107",798,"nice nice space","ep052"
"27108",801,"yeah I like this the ceilings I feel","ep052"
"27109",804,"like it may be a bit low what do you","ep052"
"27110",807,"think yeah definitely as far as working","ep052"
"27111",810,"out the terrace might be a possibility","ep052"
"27112",813,"look at this","ep052"
"27113",816,"oh my god Wow incredible this is awesome","ep052"
"27114",819,"a jewel in the crown the Sun hits it","ep052"
"27115",822,"perfectly he's incredible","ep052"
"27116",825,"my only concern is we'd have to figure","ep052"
"27117",828,"out how to baby-proof this right off the","ep052"
"27118",831,"living room it'd be so easy for Holton","ep052"
"27119",834,"to get out here so we'd have to be","ep052"
"27120",837,"really really careful but there might be","ep052"
"27121",840,"enough room out here for me to work out","ep052"
"27122",843,"and that's huge","ep052"
"27123",846,"and one of you to work out - yeah this","ep052"
"27124",849,"was a good find obviously I'm not the","ep052"
"27125",852,"one swinging a sword but I think a","ep052"
"27126",855,"workout space is the most important","ep052"
"27127",858,"thing to him and with that view they'll","ep052"
"27128",861,"be really special for him so this is the","ep052"
"27129",864,"main bathroom it's cozy it's nice","ep052"
"27130",867,"there's no bathtub just shower anything","ep052"
"27131",870,"gonna be okay for the baby it'll be a","ep052"
"27132",873,"little bit more difficult but I don't","ep052"
"27133",876,"think it'd be too bad and the second","ep052"
"27134",879,"bedroom okay this is cool","ep052"
"27135",882,"yeah like this room okay great you see","ep052"

"27216",1125,"the market means the park is amazing","ep052"
"27217",1128,"yeah of course you pay for this","ep052"
"27218",1131,"privileged position in front of the","ep052"
"27219",1134,"playing right across the road well let's","ep052"
"27220",1137,"check it out and","ep052"
"27221",1140,"see oh I'm loving how open the floor","ep052"
"27222",1143,"plan is yeah this is beautiful there's a","ep052"
"27223",1146,"lot of counter space yeah just watch it","ep052"
"27224",1149,"yes check but no washer watch this","ep052"
"27225",1152,"outside frees up space in the kitchen","ep052"
"27226",1155,"that's not huge it's nice and it's open","ep052"
"27227",1158,"plan so you can see you can see","ep052"
"27228",1161,"everything in the apartment yeah that's","ep052"
"27229",1164,"great","ep052"
"27230",1167,"this is the living room with this","ep052"
"27231",1170,"spectacular view party think she was","ep052"
"27232",1173,"talking about the amusement park at the","ep052"
"27233",1176,"doorstep oh wow","ep052"
"27234",1179,"feel the air it's so beautiful oh the","ep052"
"27235",1182,"looking at this now that the windows","ep052"
"27236",1185,"open I think this would give me a heart","ep052"
"27237",1188,"attack this is not child oh you would","ep052"
"27238",1191,"have to find this addition it is a","ep052"
"27239",1194,"beautiful park now so what do you think","ep052"
"27240",1197,"about the rest of the living room I","ep052"
"27241",1200,"think it's definitely wide enough it's","ep052"
"27242",1203,"probably a little bit too short okay for","ep052"
"27243",1206,"swinging could you practice in the park","ep052"
"27244",1209,"actually that's a really good suggestion","ep052"
"27245",1212,"that's not something I really thought","ep052"
"27246",1215,"about but with the space being so closed","ep052"
"27247",1218,"30 seconds and you're there although I","ep052"
"27248",1221,"don't know if he's gonna be loud just","ep052"
"27249",1224,"swing a sword at the park what about the","ep052"
"27250",1227,"furniture there's quite a bit of stuff","ep052"
"27251",1230,"in here","ep052"
"27252",1233,"the big pieces would stay okay it'll be","ep052"
"27253",1236,"this thing everything's negotiable Marty","ep052"
"27254",1239,"so this is the bathroom oh there's a top","ep052"
"27255",1242,"of this one that's cool that's awesome","ep052"
"27256",1245,"this bathroom is huge so this is a","ep052"
"27257",1248,"second bedroom okay so this would be","ep052"
"27258",1251,"Hilton's room I like this this has","ep052"
"27259",1254,"definitely got a lot of room this is the","ep052"
"27260",1257,"master suite","ep052"
"27261",1260,"no master suite oh it's big you're gonna","ep052"
"27262",1263,"like that shower yeah that's awesome","ep052"
"27263",1266,"ed my type of closet this is a sleeping","ep052"
"27264",1269,"area definitely spacious the mornings","ep052"
"27265",1272,"very pretty but it is missing the","ep052"
"27266",1275,"traditional Catalan architecture but","ep052"
"27267",1278,"it's elegant so it's the verdict this","ep052"
"27268",1281,"property blew my mind","ep052"
"27269",1284,"like I was expecting something good","ep052"
"27270",1287,"and came out something amazing it's","ep052"
"27271",1290,"beautiful I mean there's no arguing that","ep052"
"27272",1293,"and the fact that the park is right","ep052"
"27273",1296,"across the street can't be beat for sure","ep052"
"27274",1299,"but it does feel a bit removed from the","ep052"
"27275",1302,"center hustle and bustle of the city and","ep052"
"27276",1305,"it's pretty far from Marty's studio yeah","ep052"
"27277",1308,"that would be difficult I mean the big","ep052"
"27278",1311,"thing for me is it's over budget","ep052"
"27279",1314,"but I really like it and I am gonna be","ep052"
"27280",1317,"home a lot a lot of time with Holton's","ep052"
"27281",1320,"in a lot of time they don't need to","ep052"
"27282",1323,"practice as well everything has a price","ep052"
"27283",1326,"including the ante house you know we","ep052"
"27284",1329,"give a new family we are figuring out","ep052"
"27285",1332,"all of our expenses so I do want to","ep052"
"27286",1335,"tried carefully the part of your one oh","ep052"
"27287",1338,"my god","ep052"
"27288",1341,"there were helmets oh no we're gonna be","ep052"
"27289",1344,"that couple no you're going to be that","ep052"
"27290",1347,"spouse yeah this is manju a castle the","ep052"
"27291",1350,"year after they built it they had to use","ep052"
"27292",1353,"it in a battle oh wow yeah","ep052"
"27293",1356,"Jan and Marty are packing up the entire","ep052"
"27294",1359,"family for a life-changing move from","ep052"
"27295",1362,"Austin Texas to Barcelona Spain it's a","ep052"
"27296",1365,"pretty incredible field what do you","ep052"
"27297",1368,"think the three apartments were oh my","ep052"
"27298",1371,"gosh I have no idea","ep052"
"27299",1374,"for Marty the move means transitioning","ep052"
"27300",1377,"to full-time dad and sword wielding","ep052"
"27301",1380,"martial artist I practice historical","ep052"
"27302",1383,"European martial arts","ep052"
"27303",1386,"what's swords yes any weapons you can","ep052"
"27304",1389,"think of that at night would use I know","ep052"
"27305",1392,"the apartments are gonna be much smaller","ep052"
"27306",1395,"in Barcelona I don't","ep052"
"27307",1398,"know how hard it's gonna be to find a","ep052"
"27308",1401,"living room that's big enough for him to","ep052"
"27309",1404,"practice sword fighting so how do we","ep052"
"27310",1407,"make this decision house one brings the","ep052"
"27311",1410,"ideal location a 10-minute walk to Jen's","ep052"
"27312",1413,"job and Marty's workouts to do but it","ep052"
"27313",1416,"doesn't get them the square footage","ep052"
"27314",1419,"they're looking for swaying up and down","ep052"
"27315",1422,"definitely but I'm just not sure if it's","ep052"
"27316",1425,"gonna be wide enough I'm really worried","ep052"
"27317",1428,"I'm gonna swing a piece of metal and","ep052"
"27318",1431,"take a chunk out of a wall house 2 we","ep052"
"27319",1434,"give Marty practice space on a","ep052"
"27320",1437,"sun-drenched year pretty amazing this is","ep052"
"27321",1440,"a good fun and while it also delivers on","ep052"
"27322",1443,"amenities it misses the Spanish charm","ep052"
"27323",1446,"Jenn's after and with that neighborhood","ep052"
"27324",1449,"still communit for work but there's no","ep052"
"27325",1452,"park nearby that's a big negative house","ep052"
"27326",1455,"3d gets them the park for Bolton but a","ep052"
"27327",1458,"longer commute for Jim and it's even","ep052"
"27328",1461,"farther from the studio probably a","ep052"
"27329",1464,"little bit too short for swinging could","ep052"
"27330",1467,"you find these in the bog actually","ep052"
"27331",1470,"that's a really good suggestion","ep052"
"27332",1473,"while Marty waits on an answer from the","ep052"
"27333",1476,"parks department ahead of Finance weighs","ep052"
"27334",1479,"in it's over budget it's a little above","ep052"
"27335",1482,"budget I fell in love with them","ep052"
"27336",1485,"[Music]","ep052"
"27337",1488,"I love the 1-minute Park but I don't","ep052"
"27338",1491,"think it had a single must have to be","ep052"
"27339",1494,"honest yeah I wish those weren't valid","ep052"
"27340",1497,"points so I could push it more but I","ep052"
"27341",1500,"agree the decision gets tougher for me","ep052"
"27342",1503,"you know locations so so important I","ep052"
"27343",1506,"mean the one in the Bohr neighborhood","ep052"
"27344",1509,"that was my favorite location we could","ep052"
"27345",1512,"walk everywhere it was so unique I think","ep052"
"27346",1515,"that's maybe what's drawing me I know","ep052"
"27347",1518,"we're going for the Catalan experience","ep052"
"27348",1521,"but the apartment with the terrace that","ep052"
"27349",1524,"was pretty cool too that view is amazing","ep052"
"27350",1527,"but there's no bathtub and while the","ep052"
"27351",1530,"section of town was beautiful there was","ep052"
"27352",1533,"no big park around so it comes down to","ep052"
"27353",1536,"holding a bit and it's a longer walk to","ep052"
"27354",1539,"the studio and I think in the end time","ep052"
"27355",1542,"is a commodity for me especially with","ep052"
"27356",1545,"dealing with holding at home all day","ep052"
"27357",1548,"long and stuff like that so I think we","ep052"
"27358",1551,"know which one I think it's got to be","ep052"
"27359",1554,"the whole town you will never get an","ep052"
"27360",1557,"experience like this no","ep052"

"27365",1572,"awesome enlarged so we're making it feel","ep052"

"27367",1578,"old-world feel to a company that","ep052"
"27368",1581,"sword-swinging so I really enjoy it hone","ep052"
"27369",1584,"the skills with the spoon has gotten so","ep052"
"27370",1587,"much better","ep052"
"27371",1590,"we've been doing a lot of work on it","ep052"

"27377",1608,"won't be too long moving to Barcelona","ep052"

"27676",888,"important to Eva but fourth bedroom is","ep053"

"27718",1014,"gorgeous well it's not a pool but it's","ep053"
"27719",1017,"better than a pool for hungry I think we","ep053"
"27720",1020,"can convince her over the pool because","ep053"
"27721",1023,"the house has a sauna which I think she","ep053"
"27722",1026,"will find a lot more useful and in","ep053"
"27723",1029,"hungry than a pool so we have four","ep053"
"27724",1032,"bedrooms upstairs let's see first the","ep053"
"27725",1035,"master bedroom okay my first impression","ep053"
"27726",1038,"is actually it's too small it's a nice","ep053"
"27727",1041,"view of the yard","ep053"
"27728",1044,"that's great","ep053"
"27729",1047,"okay things a bit bigger yeah yes it's","ep053"

"27735",1065,"under budget it is they do you never","ep053"
"27736",1068,"know well I am blown away by the","ep053"
"27737",1071,"property I think it's beautiful","ep053"
"27738",1074,"the only negative really is the size of","ep053"
"27739",1077,"the master bedroom it's move-in ready","ep053"
"27740",1080,"and the location is lovely yes now tell","ep053"
"27741",1083,"me are there any schools nearby yes of","ep053"
"27742",1086,"course there are international schools","ep053"
"27743",1089,"around however it is about 30 minutes","ep053"
"27744",1092,"drive I think that's a bit far the","ep053"
"27745",1095,"biggest issues with the property it's","ep053"
"27746",1098,"far from the city and it's far from the","ep053"
"27747",1101,"school and to have to drive the kids in","ep053"
"27748",1104,"every day that's two hours out of our","ep053"
"27749",1107,"day I could see that being a problem can","ep053"
"27750",1110,"even make a convincing case for the","ep053"
"27751",1113,"house with the pool such a great feature","ep053"
"27752",1116,"to be close to everything in the","ep053"
"27753",1119,"downtown core to have a pool to have","ep053"
"27754",1122,"students it's only got three bedrooms so","ep053"
"27755",1125,"I can see that one working","ep053"
"27756",1128,"so what do you think of living here guys","ep053"
"27757",1131,"Eva and Alphonse have left France to","ep053"
"27758",1134,"return to their roots in Hungary and","ep053"
"27759",1137,"expand their family business it's gonna","ep053"
"27760",1140,"be a tough decision it will be a very","ep053"
"27761",1143,"tough decision they'll need a place big","ep053"
"27762",1146,"enough for their family and their","ep053"
"27763",1149,"students and space cost money so","ep053"
"27764",1152,"budget-conscious","ep053"
"27765",1155,"Alphonse is not thrilled about Eva's","ep053"
"27766",1158,"expensive request for a pool a pool","ep053"
"27767",1161,"house a house with a pool okay what's","ep053"
"27768",1164,"the positive the pool I'm so used to","ep053"
"27769",1167,"having a pool after five years in","ep053"
"27770",1170,"southern France I don't know if I'm","ep053"
"27771",1173,"willing to give it up it is quite a bit","ep053"
"27772",1176,"over budget the house is nice I like the","ep053"
"27773",1179,"outside a lot the problem is that it's","ep053"
"27774",1182,"only got three bedrooms a pool is","ep053"
"27775",1185,"important to Eva but I think she would","ep053"
"27776",1188,"agree with me that a fourth bedroom is","ep053"
"27777",1191,"more important than a pool what about","ep053"
"27778",1194,"the balcony house I quite like that","ep053"
"27779",1197,"house it's big it's got five bedrooms so","ep053"
"27780",1200,"from the business point of view it's","ep053"
"27781",1203,"fantastic it's very modern it is","ep053"
"27782",1206,"it's a really big help it's so beautiful","ep053"
"27783",1209,"I really love it but it doesn't have a","ep053"
"27784",1212,"pool and it's also very modern it's it's","ep053"
"27785",1215,"enormous","ep053"
"27786",1218,"I don't know if I'd want 3,000","ep053"
"27787",1221,"square-foot house but has no pool and","ep053"
"27788",1224,"it's over budget what about the","ep053"
"27789",1227,"Mediterranean style house it is under","ep053"
"27790",1230,"budget under budget enough to build a","ep053"
"27791",1233,"pool perhaps yes greens pretty big","ep053"
"27792",1236,"that's definitely enough place for a","ep053"
"27793",1239,"pool it is under budget it could be a","ep053"
"27794",1242,"possibility we could make it happen but","ep053"
"27795",1245,"for the moment we have a sauna which is","ep053"
"27796",1248,"much more suitable for the climate in","ep053"
"27797",1251,"Hungary and what about the bedrooms","ep053"
"27798",1254,"upstairs to our good sized and to","ep053"
"27799",1257,"Burgess okay sighs my first impression","ep053"
"27800",1260,"is that it's small you're right","ep053"
"27801",1263,"are the other ones bigger perhaps no","ep053"
"27802",1266,"they are similar size so they're all","ep053"
"27803",1269,"small bedrooms yes the master bedroom is","ep053"
"27804",1272,"a bit small she's right but I think it's","ep053"
"27805",1275,"a small sacrifice we have to make for","ep053"

"28167",930,"that big of a deal one bathroom per","ep054"
"28168",933,"floor is the norm and the fact that we","ep054"

"28177",960,"and just being close to them you can't","ep054"

"28185",984,"for me and the mountain view is a huge","ep054"
"28186",987,"selling point for me as well Luke is","ep054"
"28187",990,"obsessed with the mountains maybe we","ep054"
"28188",993,"just need to take a little retreat for","ep054"

"28193",1008,"not very close to the town center so","ep054"
"28194",1011,"that is a drawback for me and then not","ep054"
"28195",1014,"having two ensuite that's the drawback","ep054"
"28196",1017,"as well okay Erin does not want to hear","ep054"
"28197",1020,"the truth most of the time and I have to","ep054"

"28203",1038,"place we should be and need to be this","ep054"
"28204",1041,"is probably what we were thinking about","ep054"

"28207",1050,"clinical charmhouse so this is perfect I","ep054"
"28208",1053,"can see us living here one setback is","ep054"

"28210",1059,"hmm the lush foothills of the Dolomites","ep054"

"28221",1092,"bathrooms for their home to work but","ep054"
"28222",1095,"they don't agree on much else I want","ep054"
"28223",1098,"that Alpine Bavarian kind of feel I grew","ep054"
"28224",1101,"up in the country being secluded and I","ep054"
"28225",1104,"want to be in the hustle and bustle of","ep054"
"28226",1107,"everyday Italian life Aaron loves house","ep054"

"28232",1125,"think we'll fit let's try it why not","ep054"
"28233",1128,"what's the worst that could happen right","ep054"
"28234",1131,"but husband Luke would trade the city","ep054"
"28235",1134,"for a mountain yeah check this out and","ep054"
"28236",1137,"is willing to ditch Aaron's desired","ep054"
"28237",1140,"Italian style you just have to accept","ep054"
"28238",1143,"the fact that this is a place we should","ep054"
"28239",1146,"be and need to be awesome","ep054"

"28244",1161,"you do still have the mountain views","ep054"

"28268",1233,"dollars a month over budget","ep054"

"28491",171,"call some some form of investment yeah","ep055"
"28492",174,"we could maybe catch a ball game","ep055"
"28493",177,"grab some hot dogs so I grew up around","ep055"
"28494",180,"the Chicago suburbs about 30 miles","ep055"
"28495",183,"outside of the city it was awesome","ep055"
"28496",186,"living close to Chicago so it was a good","ep055"
"28497",189,"way to grow up I just love having a lake","ep055"
"28498",192,"so close it's almost like an ocean and I","ep055"
"28499",195,"love the beach as I'm from the west","ep055"
"28500",198,"coast and I'm used to the Sun but even","ep055"
"28501",201,"though they love the Windy City they're","ep055"
"28502",204,"over being right in the thick of it we","ep055"
"28503",207,"currently live right in the heart of","ep055"
"28504",210,"downtown in the Streeterville","ep055"
"28505",213,"neighborhood","ep055"
"28506",216,"right on the Mac mile we're a little","ep055"
"28507",219,"tired of the congestion we're looking","ep055"
"28508",222,"forward to hopefully living somewhere","ep055"
"28509",225,"where there is more of a neighborhood","ep055"
"28510",228,"feel yeah we're looking for more of a a","ep055"
"28511",231,"charming Chicago kind of location and","ep055"
"28512",234,"they both like the quaintness of the","ep055"
"28513",237,"city's north side so that's where they","ep055"
"28514",240,"choose to focus their search","ep055"
"28515",243,"so anything about this neighborhood I","ep055"
"28516",246,"think it's pretty awesome I love the","ep055"
"28517",249,"trees on the street yeah I don't feel","ep055"
"28518",252,"like I'm stepping on a tourist so that's","ep055"
"28519",255,"nice","ep055"
"28520",258,"so my ideal style of home would be to","ep055"
"28521",261,"find a very modern multi-unit building","ep055"
"28522",264,"something that has more of an industrial","ep055"
"28523",267,"feel to it or more of a contemporary","ep055"
"28524",270,"feel overall I tend to disagree I like","ep055"
"28525",273,"something a little bit more homey so I'm","ep055"
"28526",276,"more into like a bungalow style home","ep055"
"28527",279,"here in Chicago I mean if it's not a","ep055"
"28528",282,"single-family bungalow style at least a","ep055"

"28593",477,"island is gonna be big enough it looks","ep055"
"28594",480,"like the counter space is a little bit","ep055"
"28595",483,"limited but it definitely would be","ep055"
"28596",486,"workable it's just not as functional as","ep055"
"28597",489,"I was looking for I don't love this","ep055"
"28598",492,"backsplash at all it's something I could","ep055"
"28599",495,"consider doing fixing myself or fixing","ep055"

"28601",501,"higher than our budget so I don't know","ep055"

"28603",507,"ups see it is nice that there's that","ep055"
"28604",510,"desk space over there but I think it'd","ep055"
"28605",513,"be a little limited hopefully there's an","ep055"
"28606",516,"office space that we can find we do have","ep055"
"28607",519,"just two bedrooms here so yeah you might","ep055"
"28608",522,"have to sacrifice but this will come in","ep055"
"28609",525,"here we'll see right this way this is","ep055"
"28610",528,"the spare bedroom this room definitely","ep055"
"28611",531,"is not both big enough for an office and","ep055"
"28612",534,"a bedroom unfortunately I don't think","ep055"
"28613",537,"just having a desk is going to fulfill","ep055"
"28614",540,"our needs it would be nice to have a","ep055"
"28615",543,"designated office space they make their","ep055"
"28616",546,"way down the hall and peek in on a guest","ep055"

"28624",570,"in your arms our bathroom it's exactly","ep055"
"28625",573,"what we were looking for I'm not sure","ep055"

"28632",594,"need to get done it's just unnecessary","ep055"
"28633",597,"stress that I don't think we need to add","ep055"

"28694",780,"all for 475 oh okay","ep055"
"28695",783,"senator price range it's on the upper","ep055"
"28696",786,"end of our price range but yeah it's","ep055"
"28697",789,"definitely within our price range that's","ep055"
"28698",792,"nice it's a ton of space the bay window","ep055"
"28699",795,"is beautiful let me show you the dining","ep055"
"28700",798,"room okay nice big space yeah it's","ep055"
"28701",801,"really large","ep055"
"28702",804,"yeah it's a nice space but I wish","ep055"
"28703",807,"everything was open I wish it was open","ep055"
"28704",810,"to the kitchen I wish this wall was gone","ep055"
"28705",813,"and would open up to the living room","ep055"
"28706",816,"might be something we could take down","ep055"
"28707",819,"low then we're out of our budget","ep055"
"28708",822,"if Frey keeps looking for these projects","ep055"
"28709",825,"to find in every house that we look at","ep055"
"28710",828,"then it's going to be difficult for us","ep055"
"28711",831,"to be able to find a place within budget","ep055"
"28712",834,"I love the Big Island","ep055"
"28713",837,"how much counter space actually there's","ep055"
"28714",840,"a ton of prep space in this kitchen","ep055"
"28715",843,"that being said I don't love the","ep055"
"28716",846,"countertops um so we definitely need new","ep055"
"28717",849,"countertops and flooring the cabinets","ep055"
"28718",852,"are great though and the appliances are","ep055"
"28719",855,"all stainless steel you have a gas stove","ep055"
"28720",858,"over here yeah that's awesome I love","ep055"
"28721",861,"that I love the functionality of this","ep055"
"28722",864,"kitchen it'd be perfect if it was","ep055"
"28723",867,"updated but I just don't think in the","ep055"
"28724",870,"budget we'd be able to do the updates","ep055"
"28725",873,"that we'd want to do well these are","ep055"
"28726",876,"minor things you could do in time right","ep055"
"28727",879,"I mean we don't have to do that all","ep055"
"28728",882,"right away but maybe these are the","ep055"
"28729",885,"things we do right away and we save the","ep055"
"28730",888,"other projects for later","ep055"
"28731",891,"what is that that's actually a hot tub","ep055"
"28732",894,"built-in oh that's awesome","ep055"
"28733",897,"but it's kind of in the middle of the","ep055"
"28734",900,"deck which I don't love yeah awkward","ep055"
"28735",903,"spacing but I mean the hot tubs are hot","ep055"
"28736",906,"them so it's a space it's a perfect","ep055"
"28737",909,"space for entertaining your brain so it","ep055"
"28738",912,"must go right back there the charm that","ep055"
"28739",915,"Rey is looking for in Chicago is not the","ep055"
"28740",918,"easiest in their budget so there are","ep055"
"28741",921,"definitely a lot of compromises about","ep055"
"28742",924,"this house the Train is pretty much in","ep055"
"28743",927,"the backyard of this home so if we were","ep055"
"28744",930,"to buy this home we'd have to know that","ep055"
"28745",933,"we're gonna be hearing that train so it","ep055"
"28746",936,"just might be something we'd have to get","ep055"
"28747",939,"used to they head back inside and","ep055"
"28748",942,"upstairs to look in on a guest room bath","ep055"
"28749",945,"and a potential office yeah it's a nice","ep055"
"28750",948,"space for working and there's plenty of","ep055"
"28751",951,"light to come in yeah down the hall is","ep055"
"28752",954,"the master suite","ep055"
"28753",957,"I love these vaulted ceilings a ton of","ep055"
"28754",960,"closet space it's a lot of mirror action","ep055"
"28755",963,"goes on as well we could probably","ep055"
"28756",966,"decrease that a little bit so you could","ep055"
"28757",969,"change those out and then you have an","ep055"
"28758",972,"ensuite bathroom okay Wow a big bathtub","ep055"
"28759",975,"and a lot of brown tile and there's only","ep055"
"28760",978,"in one sink","ep055"
"28761",981,"I'd rather have more counter space than","ep055"
"28762",984,"this giant bathtub I do think this would","ep055"
"28763",987,"be a big project with all this tile yeah","ep055"
"28764",990,"sounds a lot of big projects in this","ep055"
"28765",993,"house I loved that it's a little bit of","ep055"
"28766",996,"an older home and has a lot of charm","ep055"
"28767",999,"ailments they window the stairs the","ep055"
"28768",1002,"hardwoods like there's so much charm in","ep055"
"28769",1005,"it there's a ton of space we love the","ep055"
"28770",1008,"square footage there's a lot of","ep055"
"28771",1011,"retaining and I love that there's for me","ep055"
"28772",1014,"just the right amount of project so I","ep055"
"28773",1017,"could customize the bathroom did have","ep055"
"28774",1020,"that great back deck I was hoping for a","ep055"
"28775",1023,"little more privacy on the outdoor space","ep055"
"28776",1026,"but really pretty great for something in","ep055"
"28777",1029,"the city but I'd love to see someplace","ep055"
"28778",1032,"didn't have quite so many projects okay","ep055"
"28779",1035,"we can do that so they head out to see","ep055"
"28780",1038,"another option well that's pretty great","ep055"
"28781",1041,"it's a brand-new construction thank you","ep055"
"28782",1044,"very much first-time buyers ray and Neil","ep055"
"28783",1047,"are on the hunt for a place in Chicago","ep055"
"28784",1050,"that has the ability to entertain","ep055"
"28785",1053,"outdoors working with a four hundred and","ep055"
"28786",1056,"seventy five thousand dollar max budget","ep055"
"28787",1059,"so far they've seen a condo penthouse","ep055"
"28788",1062,"with a modern vibe for Neil and a","ep055"
"28789",1065,"rooftop deck they loved but it was over","ep055"
"28790",1068,"budget at $500,000 then they saw a","ep055"
"28791",1071,"single-family Craftsman style home","ep055"
"28792",1074,"priced within budget at four hundred and","ep055"
"28793",1077,"seventy five thousand dollars it too had","ep055"
"28794",1080,"a large deck but a train line runs","ep055"
"28795",1083,"through the backyard and while ray loved","ep055"
"28796",1086,"his old charm Neil thought all the","ep055"
"28797",1089,"needed projects would break the bank so","ep055"
"28798",1092,"today their agent is showing them a","ep055"
"28799",1095,"model home in the Bridgeport","ep055"
"28800",1098,"neighborhood 15 minutes south of the","ep055"
"28801",1101,"city not the north side like they prefer","ep055"
"28802",1104,"the neighborhoods a little bit less","ep055"
"28803",1107,"charming than what both of us are","ep055"
"28804",1110,"looking for it's not that much of a","ep055"
"28805",1113,"neighborhood actual feel it might be an","ep055"
"28806",1116,"up-and-coming part town which is maybe","ep055"
"28807",1119,"but we don't go out around here at all","ep055"
"28808",1122,"that's true so we'd have to commute for","ep055"
"28809",1125,"that yeah well that's pretty great it's","ep055"
"28810",1128,"a brand-new construction I love the","ep055"
"28811",1131,"brick exterior yeah I don't know about","ep055"
"28812",1134,"all the multi colors with the brick but","ep055"
"28813",1137,"[Music]","ep055"
"28814",1140,"oh there's some interesting floors","ep055"
"28815",1143,"they're yellow so for bad","ep055"
"28816",1146,"three-and-a-half bath townhome and we're","ep055"
"28817",1149,"looking at the model home today which is","ep055"
"28818",1152,"for sale as is with all of the upgrades","ep055"
"28819",1155,"at 4:52 oh that's great sir I mean are","ep055"
"28820",1158,"all them like finished do we have to get","ep055"
"28821",1161,"the same with upgrades or is that","ep055"
"28822",1164,"customized for this unit there are some","ep055"
"28823",1167,"customizable options if we went for a","ep055"
"28824",1170,"different unit really we don't have to","ep055"
"28825",1173,"have this tile okay right off the bat","ep055"
"28826",1176,"you have a bedroom on the first floor","ep055"
"28827",1179,"all right small but it would work for an","ep055"
"28828",1182,"office space definitely this is perfect","ep055"
"28829",1185,"office space","ep055"
"28830",1188,"I love these industrial accidents","ep055"
"28831",1191,"something not crazy about this it's","ep055"
"28832",1194,"really interesting how they're trying to","ep055"
"28833",1197,"combine the industrial look with the I","ep055"
"28834",1200,"don't know and check out your kitchen I","ep055"
"28835",1203,"can't stop looking at the LED this is","ep055"
"28836",1206,"exactly like the kind of kitchen that","ep055"
"28837",1209,"I'm looking for maybe - the LED lights","ep055"
"28838",1212,"big open island which is perfect my","ep055"
"28839",1215,"cabinets are just what we're looking for","ep055"
"28840",1218,"there's stainless steel appliances guest","ep055"
"28841",1221,"Oh everything's brand-new we don't have","ep055"
"28842",1224,"to do any work to it and then notice -","ep055"
"28843",1227,"you have your space for a formal dining","ep055"
"28844",1230,"all right it's your isolated dining room","ep055"
"28845",1233,"big dining space could fit a bigger","ep055"
"28846",1236,"table in here yeah that's true and then","ep055"
"28847",1239,"notice you have a little outdoor space","ep055"
"28848",1242,"off the kitchen here kind of a smaller","ep055"
"28849",1245,"space the only outdoor space this is the","ep055"
"28850",1248,"only outdoor space a little","ep055"
"28851",1251,"disappointing back inside they make","ep055"
"28852",1254,"their way to the third floor they look","ep055"
"28853",1257,"in on two guest rooms and again","ep055"
"28854",1260,"before heading to the master suite I","ep055"
"28855",1263,"like these floors up here that the wood","ep055"
"28856",1266,"runs throughout the whole top of what it","ep055"
"28857",1269,"would look like if you did the hardwood","ep055"
"28858",1272,"option okay all right so it's pretty big","ep055"
"28859",1275,"yeah it's definitely a great size and","ep055"
"28860",1278,"then you have your ensuite bath okay","ep055"
"28861",1281,"okay I'm not so sure about this vanity","ep055"
"28862",1284,"it's only a single sink it'd be ideal to","ep055"
"28863",1287,"have a double sink but honestly the","ep055"
"28864",1290,"aesthetics of all these features I","ep055"
"28865",1293,"really like them","ep055"
"28866",1296,"yeah but the aesthetics don't make up","ep055"
"28867",1299,"for the fact that there's not two things","ep055"
"28868",1302,"yeah I mean maybe we wouldn't notice it","ep055"
"28869",1305,"as much if we have something they still","ep055"
"28870",1308,"look at I don't know I love the fact","ep055"
"28871",1311,"that it's modern it's brand spankin new","ep055"
"28872",1314,"way too modern for me personally there's","ep055"
"28873",1317,"not really any character or anything","ep055"
"28874",1320,"charming about this place there's some","ep055"
"28875",1323,"definitely some odd features to this","ep055"
"28876",1326,"place that don't have the charm that I'm","ep055"
"28877",1329,"looking for but the best part about this","ep055"
"28878",1332,"place is potentially we could swap out","ep055"
"28879",1335,"some of those aesthetic details that you","ep055"
"28880",1338,"don't like and we wouldn't have to deal","ep055"
"28881",1341,"with a major renovation so that's a","ep055"
"28882",1344,"major positive yeah it did lack the","ep055"
"28883",1347,"outdoor space all that we were looking","ep055"
"28884",1350,"for sure I did like the kitchen though","ep055"
"28885",1353,"the white cabinets were great I loved","ep055"
"28886",1356,"the island and the wood floors upstairs","ep055"
"28887",1359,"too we're also a nice feature that maybe","ep055"
"28888",1362,"we could run those throughout the entire","ep055"
"28889",1365,"unit yeah okay I think this is going to","ep055"
"28890",1368,"be a really tough decision for both of","ep055"
"28891",1371,"us but yeah pull it over a little bit","ep055"
"28892",1374,"and what they'll need to mull over is","ep055"
"28893",1377,"what's most important a large outdoor","ep055"
"28894",1380,"deck for entertaining being in their","ep055"
"28895",1383,"preferred part of town or staying under","ep055"
"28896",1386,"budget even with some renovations I","ep055"
"28897",1389,"think I know it's way","ep055"
"28898",1392,"[Music]","ep055"
"28899",1395,"and in some systems yeah it thinks","ep055"
"28900",1398,"that's it this Chicago couple is getting","ep055"
"28901",1401,"ready to buy their first home they've","ep055"
"28902",1404,"seen their options and now it's time to","ep055"
"28903",1407,"decide so what did you think about the","ep055"
"28904",1410,"penthouse condo it was exactly the kind","ep055"
"28905",1413,"of modern style that I was looking for","ep055"
"28906",1416,"it was the modern style you were looking","ep055"
"28907",1419,"for that rooftop was incredibly top was","ep055"
"28908",1422,"incredible however on the inside of the","ep055"
"28909",1425,"house there really was no charm and we","ep055"
"28910",1428,"would need to do some updating and the","ep055"
"28911",1431,"problem with that place that it was","ep055"
"28912",1434,"already wailed and it was only two","ep055"
"28913",1437,"bedrooms so you wouldn't get that office","ep055"
"28914",1440,"that you were looking for well what did","ep055"
"28915",1443,"you think about the single-family","ep055"
"28916",1446,"craftsman","ep055"
"28917",1449,"I loved the single-family Craftsman time","ep055"
"28918",1452,"I was looking for it but it's just so","ep055"
"28919",1455,"many renovations the 475 doesn't even","ep055"
"28920",1458,"adequately measure our budget because","ep055"
"28921",1461,"we'd be tacking on so many projects but","ep055"
"28922",1464,"it did have great bones the perfect size","ep055"
"28923",1467,"with the three bedrooms sure we would","ep055"
"28924",1470,"have space for an actual office that","ep055"
"28925",1473,"didn't have a really nice large outdoor","ep055"
"28926",1476,"space but there's also a train to","ep055"
"28927",1479,"contend with what did you think about","ep055"
"28928",1482,"the ultra-modern townhome it's","ep055"
"28929",1485,"definitely more your safe I love the","ep055"
"28930",1488,"fact that it was a new build it was at","ep055"
"28931",1491,"the bottom end of our budget at 450","ep055"
"28932",1494,"degree and that was with all the","ep055"
"28933",1497,"upgrades already one of the really cool","ep055"
"28934",1500,"things about that place was everything","ep055"
"28935",1503,"was customizable but you still can't add","ep055"
"28936",1506,"that charm to that new of a home and I","ep055"
"28937",1509,"don't think there's much they can do","ep055"
"28938",1512,"about that and it was no outdoor space","ep055"
"28939",1515,"but it was massive I have four bedrooms","ep055"
"28940",1518,"there was plenty of space for guest","ep055"
"28941",1521,"rooms and we would have an isolated","ep055"
"28942",1524,"space for that office I think I know","ep055"
"28943",1527,"which way I'm leaning","ep055"
"28944",1530,"[Music]","ep055"
"28945",1533,"so condo penthouse yeah as much as I","ep055"
"28946",1536,"love the single-family craftsman it","ep055"
"28947",1539,"would be a lot of work so I think I'm in","ep055"
"28948",1542,"for the condo penthouse - I just loved","ep055"
"28949",1545,"the outdoor space and it had that small","ep055"
"28950",1548,"desk so if you wanted to use that as an","ep055"
"28951",1551,"office that would be an option let's","ep055"
"28952",1554,"give Amy a call all right left side a","ep055"
"28953",1557,"little bit higher yeah there you go","ep055"
"28954",1560,"it's very exciting being first-time","ep055"
"28955",1563,"homebuyers we learned a lot about the","ep055"
"28956",1566,"process they both had to make some","ep055"
"28957",1569,"compromises let me chose this home you","ep055"
"28958",1572,"know the home was over budget but with","ep055"
"28959",1575,"the help of Amy we were able to get the","ep055"
"28960",1578,"price down to four hundred and ninety","ep055"
"28961",1581,"one thousand dollars I think that you","ep055"
"28962",1584,"know in the long run it's good equity so","ep055"
"28963",1587,"I feel like we were eventually","ep055"
"28964",1590,"comfortable settling at that price even","ep055"
"28965",1593,"though it was a little over budget I","ep055"
"28966",1596,"think the fact that we just loved how","ep055"
"28967",1599,"charming the neighborhood was kind of","ep055"
"28968",1602,"sold us to really great feeling being in","ep055"
"28969",1605,"the neighborhood and I'm excited to","ep055"
"28970",1608,"settle in down here where is haven't you","ep055"
"28971",1611,"seen Karate Kid we decided to take on a","ep055"
"28972",1614,"few projects so one bathroom right now","ep055"
"28973",1617,"is completely torn up the master we're","ep055"
"28974",1620,"gonna do new mirrors and new lighting","ep055"
"28975",1623,"and probably do a shiplap accent wall","ep055"
"28976",1626,"behind the vanity initially I wanted","ep055"
"28977",1629,"something that was relatively turnkey","ep055"
"28978",1632,"ray wanted something that had a little","ep055"
"28979",1635,"bit of projects to work with so this","ep055"
"28980",1638,"place was a pretty good compromise it's","ep055"
"28981",1641,"totally ready to live in and by the time","ep055"

"29253",753,"more for an upgraded colonial so far","ep056"
"29254",756,"they've seen a Dutch colonial perfect","ep056"
"29255",759,"for Carolyn it was below budget but it","ep056"

"29487",1455,"something I really don't think we can","ep056"
"29488",1458,"handle but since none of the homes have","ep056"

"29490",1464,"Robbie and Carolyn's needs won't be easy","ep056"

"29496",1482,"price range","ep056"
"29497",1485,"they're ready to make a decision what","ep056"
"29498",1488,"did you think about the Dutch colonial","ep056"
"29499",1491,"that was what 365 yeah I mean it's","ep056"
"29500",1494,"definitely the best price it has a nice","ep056"
"29501",1497,"basement it gave us that extra space","ep056"
"29502",1500,"that we needed yeah it has a lot of","ep056"
"29503",1503,"storage which I think you know is also","ep056"
"29504",1506,"something that we're looking for true","ep056"
"29505",1509,"and had the great backyard yeah but it","ep056"
"29506",1512,"was three bedrooms and one of them was","ep056"
"29507",1515,"downstairs but you know I don't like","ep056"
"29508",1518,"that kitchen was very closed off the","ep056"
"29509",1521,"whole house was pretty small I mean I","ep056"
"29510",1524,"loved this under budget yeah it was the","ep056"
"29511",1527,"tiny side and it didn't have an office","ep056"
"29512",1530,"for Robbie but their second option","ep056"
"29513",1533,"listed for four hundred and ten thousand","ep056"
"29514",1536,"dollars had plenty of space for his","ep056"
"29515",1539,"office house is huge I mean there was a","ep056"
"29516",1542,"lot of room all four bedrooms on one","ep056"
"29517",1545,"floor it had the whole upstairs section","ep056"
"29518",1548,"the third floor I mean is right across","ep056"
"29519",1551,"the street from that park and had that","ep056"
"29520",1554,"beautiful front porch you know was a","ep056"
"29521",1557,"little over budget but I loved the","ep056"
"29522",1560,"character you just don't find houses","ep056"
"29523",1563,"like that with that great trim and the","ep056"
"29524",1566,"woodwork in front all the wallpaper","ep056"
"29525",1569,"Robbie we can't do that and the basement","ep056"
"29526",1572,"was awful the basement was creepy","ep056"
"29527",1575,"that kitchen was bad and heavy no","ep056"
"29528",1578,"open-concept but I'm sure I can make","ep056"
"29529",1581,"some updates and make that a little bit","ep056"
"29530",1584,"more homey over time and then the tutor","ep056"
"29531",1587,"that was 420 I mean it was the highest","ep056"
"29532",1590,"on the budget end which concern me but","ep056"
"29533",1593,"we can move in right away but that pace","ep056"
"29534",1596,"was so nice it really did so much space","ep056"
"29535",1599,"and I had all the bedrooms on the same","ep056"
"29536",1602,"floor you know I think a head under the","ep056"
"29537",1605,"open concept which I like and it had a","ep056"
"29538",1608,"really nice office for me but there was","ep056"

"29542",1620,"house with that great trim in the","ep056"
"29543",1623,"woodwork just needs a little bit of work","ep056"
"29544",1626,"it's not it's more than a little I think","ep056"
"29545",1629,"it'd be nice to move into an updated","ep056"

"29605",12,"then and Christine are done with DC","ep057"
"29606",15,"I just need to get used to driving on","ep057"
"29607",18,"the left-hand side of the road we are","ep057"
"29608",21,"newlyweds and we wanted to get out of","ep057"
"29609",24,"the rat race in Washington DC Ben was","ep057"
"29610",27,"born down and","ep057"
"29611",30,"and it's been his dream to return home","ep057"
"29612",33,"it's always been in my blood to come","ep057"
"29613",36,"back to Sydney","ep057"
"29614",39,"but for Christine uprooting everything","ep057"
"29615",42,"isn't so easy it's hard to think about","ep057"
"29616",45,"leaving the stability of hind Creek the","ep057"
"29617",48,"unknown so with no jobs one dog and two","ep057"
"29618",51,"suitcases the pressure is on it's kind","ep057"
"29619",54,"of generic for me the location is great","ep057"
"29620",57,"it's terrible","ep057"
"29621",60,"I know Christine really loves that view","ep057"
"29622",63,"but she's definitely gonna have to give","ep057"
"29623",66,"me a lot of love it","ep057"
"29624",69,"[Laughter]","ep057"
"29625",72,"[Music]","ep057"
"29626",75,"so this is a little bit different than","ep057"
"29627",78,"Washington DC","ep057"
"29628",81,"just a little certainly more people","ep057"
"29629",84,"barefoot and in bathing suits here Ben","ep057"
"29630",87,"and I met about two years ago and when","ep057"
"29631",90,"we met each other we were both very","ep057"
"29632",93,"focused on our careers I was an","ep057"
"29633",96,"accountant and Ben was in sales","ep057"
"29634",99,"shortly after meeting I think we both","ep057"
"29635",102,"had a priority shift I have a really","ep057"
"29636",105,"good feel about it here our relationship","ep057"
"29637",108,"and our quality of life moved right to","ep057"
"29638",111,"the top of the list I gladly take this","ep057"
"29639",114,"over the Beltway in DC any day Hey we","ep057"
"29640",117,"decided to get rid of all of our","ep057"
"29641",120,"possessions and we made our move to","ep057"
"29642",123,"Australia the one other thing we did","ep057"
"29643",126,"bring besides some clothes was our dog","ep057"
"29644",129,"Tallulah Tallulah it's a little daunting","ep057"
"29645",132,"making the move to a country you've","ep057"
"29646",135,"never been to before","ep057"
"29647",138,"[Music]","ep057"
"29648",141,"we've been married for only six months","ep057"
"29649",144,"and yet we've taken this huge turn in","ep057"
"29650",147,"our lives so one of my biggest fears","ep057"
"29651",150,"moving Christine across the world to","ep057"
"29652",153,"Australia is that she would regret it I","ep057"
"29653",156,"so hope that she loves the drastic","ep057"
"29654",159,"change in lifestyle just 25 miles north","ep057"
"29655",162,"of bustling Sydney Avalon Beach is a","ep057"
"29656",165,"laid-back suburb that offers surfing","ep057"
"29657",168,"nature and a dose of tranquillity when a","ep057"
"29658",171,"lot of folks come to Sydney they tend to","ep057"
"29659",174,"do the downtown area but if you've just","ep057"
"29660",177,"come about an hour and a half north you","ep057"
"29661",180,"hit this peninsula which is just","ep057"
"29662",183,"gorgeous we fell in love with the","ep057"
"29663",186,"attitude up here the beautiful beaches","ep057"
"29664",189,"and the amazing Heights and bushwalking","ep057"
"29665",192,"that you can do in this area the market","ep057"
"29666",195,"in Avalon is very competitive","ep057"
"29667",198,"we have people moving across the world","ep057"
"29668",201,"through to the northern beaches and","ep057"
"29669",204,"there's not that many houses that comes","ep057"
"29670",207,"up for rent so you really need to grab","ep057"
"29671",210,"it if you find money like so what are","ep057"
"29672",213,"you guys looking for ideally we're","ep057"
"29673",216,"looking for at least two bedrooms and","ep057"
"29674",219,"one full bath yeah I would love to be in","ep057"
"29675",222,"close proximity to the beach absolutely","ep057"
"29676",225,"we're in Australia love to wake up in","ep057"
"29677",228,"the morning be able to take a run go for","ep057"
"29678",231,"a swim I would also love to be close to","ep057"
"29679",234,"the action maybe downtown Avalon with","ep057"
"29680",237,"all it has going on and I'm looking for","ep057"
"29681",240,"something that's unique has a lot of","ep057"
"29682",243,"character and something with the view of","ep057"
"29683",246,"the water it would be great also we have","ep057"
"29684",249,"a dog so we need to find a place that's","ep057"
"29685",252,"dog friendly so what sort of budget do","ep057"
"29686",255,"you look at our budget is mm all right","ep057"
"29687",258,"she wants a lot of character and he","ep057"
"29688",261,"wants to be close to downtown Avalon and","ep057"
"29689",264,"they also want a nice view and to be","ep057"
"29690",267,"close to the beach so my strategy is to","ep057"
"29691",270,"show them a townhouse first which is","ep057"
"29692",273,"under budget it's also the most","ep057"
"29693",276,"practical property it's pretty much","ep057"
"29694",279,"everything they're looking for","ep057"
"29695",282,"excessively that's not a view taking it","ep057"
"29696",285,"to this fine guys because it's really","ep057"
"29697",288,"good value you have three bedrooms one","ep057"
"29698",291,"bathroom and fenced off backyard which","ep057"
"29699",294,"is perfect for a Tallulah yes great and","ep057"
"29700",297,"how close to the beaches you're about","ep057"
"29701",300,"the three minute walk to the beach five","ep057"
"29702",303,"six minute walk to downtown Avalon Wow","ep057"
"29703",306,"and it's $1,800 a month so it's under","ep057"
"29704",309,"budget one day yes wonderful","ep057"
"29705",312,"so here's the living room","ep057"
"29706",315,"lots of natural light but the floor plan","ep057"
"29707",318,"is a little bit closed off I wish it was","ep057"
"29708",321,"more of an open layout I like it though","ep057"
"29709",324,"it's a nice-sized room yeah and the","ep057"
"29710",327,"ceilings seem really tall too which is","ep057"
"29711",330,"good for us since were tall people","ep057"
"29712",333,"because you're so it's off freakishly","ep057"
"29713",336,"I'm learning things about Christine","ep057"
"29714",339,"every day","ep057"
"29715",342,"first bedroom it's on the smaller side","ep057"
"29716",345,"but it's perfect for guests are these","ep057"
"29717",348,"ceilings hiding the food bin yeah we","ep057"
"29718",351,"have a separate toilet and bathroom then","ep057"
"29719",354,"you have a shower and a bathtub yep","ep057"
"29720",357,"really nice like that come into your","ep057"
"29721",360,"master here","ep057"
"29722",363,"it's pretty big but it is missing a","ep057"
"29723",366,"little bit of character and you don't","ep057"
"29724",369,"have much of a view","ep057"
"29725",372,"I think views are nice but for me it's","ep057"
"29726",375,"always what they say location location","ep057"
"29727",378,"location","ep057"
"29728",381,"I think being walking distance to places","ep057"
"29729",384,"is a huge advantage here's the kitchen","ep057"
"29730",387,"it's really big but a little bit","ep057"
"29731",390,"outdated","ep057"
"29732",393,"and I would like it to be open with the","ep057"
"29733",396,"living space as well because we like to","ep057"
"29734",399,"cook a lot and also you know we're","ep057"
"29735",402,"relaxing there it'd be nice to all be","ep057"
"29736",405,"together that's why we're really good to","ep057"
"29737",408,"go out to the backyard from the kitchen","ep057"
"29738",411,"okay yeah let's check that out let's","ep057"
"29739",414,"have a look I love that it's fenced in","ep057"
"29740",417,"Tolu is gonna love this from a","ep057"
"29741",420,"practicality standpoint hit the nail on","ep057"
"29742",423,"the head I mean for two unemployed","ep057"
"29743",426,"people that just moved to Australia it","ep057"
"29744",429,"makes a lot of sense because it's under","ep057"
"29745",432,"budget I love the location close to the","ep057"
"29746",435,"beach and close to downtown Avalon well","ep057"
"29747",438,"seems pretty generic and it's missing a","ep057"
"29748",441,"view it had no wow factor no character","ep057"
"29749",444,"and honestly I kind of don't remember it","ep057"
"29750",447,"but this outdoor space is gonna be tough","ep057"
"29751",450,"to pass on yeah","ep057"
"29752",453,"it's a huge shock to the system right","ep057"
"29753",456,"moving thirteen thousand miles from home","ep057"
"29754",459,"so really hoping that EDA can find a","ep057"
"29755",462,"place that makes Christine really happy","ep057"
"29756",465,"and all the while trying to keep my wish","ep057"
"29757",468,"of being close to the beaches close to","ep057"
"29758",471,"downtown in mind wow this feels amazing","ep057"
"29759",474,"could stare at this all day this Dean is","ep057"
"29760",477,"smitten our legs will definitely get in","ep057"
"29761",480,"shape but we might need to build a slide","ep057"
"29762",483,"bed and then maybe fighting an uphill","ep057"
"29763",486,"battle having to bring Tallulah up every","ep057"
"29764",489,"time she needs a log who do you think","ep057"
"29765",492,"that's gonna rely on me I think that","ep057"
"29766",495,"this million dollar view more than makes","ep057"
"29767",498,"up for it there's no better way to see","ep057"
"29768",501,"the Northern Beaches then by seaplane","ep057"
"29769",504,"newlyweds ban and Christine are moving","ep057"
"29770",507,"to Australia to slow down and start a","ep057"
"29771",510,"life together","ep057"
"29772",513,"well yes originally from Sydney man is","ep057"
"29773",516,"dreamed of returning to his childhood","ep057"
"29774",519,"home I'm your pilot but for Christine","ep057"
"29775",522,"change is harder it's a little daunting","ep057"
"29776",525,"making the move from a country you've","ep057"
"29777",528,"lived your whole life into a country","ep057"
"29778",531,"you've never been to before","ep057"
"29779",534,"[Music]","ep057"
"29780",537,"we're only a few months into this thing","ep057"
"29781",540,"they call marriage and so there's","ep057"
"29782",543,"certainly some apprehension there's some","ep057"
"29783",546,"nervousness particularly for my wife","ep057"
"29784",549,"leaving the stability of our jobs and","ep057"
"29785",552,"the incomes that we had was difficult","ep057"
"29786",555,"we're going from very rigorous demanding","ep057"
"29787",558,"rewarding jobs to unemployment and being","ep057"
"29788",561,"on a budget","ep057"
"29789",564,"house 1 is affordable and more it's","ep057"
"29790",567,"$1,800 a month so it's under budget Wow","ep057"
"29791",570,"and your about the treatment off to the","ep057"
"29792",573,"beach","ep057"
"29793",576,"five six minute walk to downtown Avalon","ep057"
"29794",579,"me location is important that's one of","ep057"
"29795",582,"the reasons we moved to Australia is to","ep057"
"29796",585,"take advantage of the beautiful beaches","ep057"
"29797",588,"here in Sydney area it's definitely very","ep057"
"29798",591,"practical and the ceilings seem really","ep057"
"29799",594,"tall too which is good for us since","ep057"
"29800",597,"we're tall people because you're so tall","ep057"
"29801",600,"okay are these ceilings high enough you","ep057"
"29802",603,"big yeah but it still comes up short you","ep057"
"29803",606,"don't have much of a view it does look a","ep057"
"29804",609,"little dated and it's kind of generic","ep057"
"29805",612,"it's gonna take a little work to","ep057"
"29806",615,"convince Christine that this is the most","ep057"
"29807",618,"practical choice I mean for two","ep057"
"29808",621,"unemployed people that just moved to","ep057"
"29809",624,"Australia it makes a lot of sense old me","ep057"
"29810",627,"obviously I want to keep her happy she's","ep057"
"29811",630,"helping me live out my dream I hope this","ep057"
"29812",633,"next house EDA takes us to has","ep057"
"29813",636,"everything on our wish list I just need","ep057"
"29814",639,"to get used to driving on the left-hand","ep057"
"29815",642,"side of the road my strategy is to show","ep057"
"29816",645,"them a cute house what a beautiful gift","ep057"
"29817",648,"but it's not really that dog friendly so","ep057"
"29818",651,"they'll have to compromise on a few","ep057"
"29819",654,"things","ep057"
"29820",657,"check out this view guys well this view","ep057"
"29821",660,"is amazing","ep057"
"29822",663,"absolutely love it well done eat it yes","ep057"
"29823",666,"we have a two bedrooms open plan living","ep057"
"29824",669,"and you have an outdoor area Wow and","ep057"
"29825",672,"what's the proximity of the beach in","ep057"
"29826",675,"downtown Avalon you're a 20-minute walk","ep057"
"29827",678,"from downtown Avalon and about a","ep057"
"29828",681,"15-minute walk from the beach definitely","ep057"
"29829",684,"a bit further than I was hoping is this","ep057"
"29830",687,"house dog-friendly","ep057"
"29831",690,"and you can definitely have a dog here","ep057"
"29832",693,"but it might not be the most practical","ep057"
"29833",696,"house for a dog and is this the only","ep057"
"29834",699,"access to the house it is the only","ep057"
"29835",702,"access our legs will definitely get in","ep057"
"29836",705,"shape but we might need to build a slide","ep057"
"29837",708,"babe what is the price on this one so","ep057"
"29838",711,"it's slightly over budget at 2,200 Suns","ep057"
"29839",714,"good","ep057"
"29840",717,"Wow this is stunning love the open","ep057"
"29841",720,"layout it's exactly what we were looking","ep057"
"29842",723,"for I love that the deck connects to the","ep057"
"29843",726,"living room and you could have one big","ep057"
"29844",729,"open-air living space and there's even a","ep057"
"29845",732,"fireplace","ep057"
"29846",735,"it's really great we also have a really","ep057"
"29847",738,"good loft area that's supposed to be the","ep057"
"29848",741,"master bedroom no it's not the master","ep057"
"29849",744,"bedroom but it'd be great for guests","ep057"
"29850",747,"staying over extra storage or you know","ep057"
"29851",750,"kids running around nice I really like","ep057"
"29852",753,"that option and I think that the spiral","ep057"
"29853",756,"staircase adds a lot of character to the","ep057"
"29854",759,"home I don't know if I see mom and dad","ep057"
"29855",762,"or little kids running up and down it'd","ep057"
"29856",765,"be a nice rec room or movie room or","ep057"
"29857",768,"shipping yeah every boss rented left","ep057"
"29858",771,"here I like the bathroom the great color","ep057"
"29859",774,"paint and really cool subway tiles tub","ep057"
"29860",777,"is huge plus agreed it's really nice","ep057"

"29862",783,"bedroom","ep057"
"29863",786,"okay it's a bit tight isn't it yeah it","ep057"
"29864",789,"is a little tight well it tastes a bit","ep057"
"29865",792,"on the smaller side but you do have the","ep057"
"29866",795,"double built-in wardrobe yeah this is","ep057"
"29867",798,"really nice and it'll definitely fit","ep057"
"29868",801,"everything we brought with us see every","ep057"

"29942",1023,"to the beaches","ep057"
"29943",1026,"I think the northern beaches are hidden","ep057"
"29944",1029,"gem of Sydney you're about three minute","ep057"
"29945",1032,"walk to the beach Wow","ep057"
"29946",1035,"I love the idea of waking up in the","ep057"
"29947",1038,"morning going for a run down to the","ep057"
"29948",1041,"beach and having a swim but I think it's","ep057"
"29949",1044,"gonna take a little work to convince","ep057"
"29950",1047,"Christine this is the right choice for","ep057"
"29951",1050,"us the most practical choice you don't","ep057"
"29952",1053,"have much of a view a little bit","ep057"
"29953",1056,"terrible and seems pretty generic house","ep057"

"29957",1068,"beaches and downtown Avalon the main","ep057"
"29958",1071,"downside of that house is that it's not","ep057"
"29959",1074,"very dog-friendly every time we walked a","ep057"
"29960",1077,"little half to walk her up those stairs","ep057"
"29961",1080,"definitely a big negative the next house","ep057"
"29962",1083,"is in a fantastic location","ep057"
"29963",1086,"it's got heaps of charm really nice","ep057"
"29964",1089,"backyard and it's fenced in so it's good","ep057"

"29978",1131,"no well it is slightly over budget which","ep057"
"29979",1134,"is it it's 2,200 okay but let's have a","ep057"

"29990",1167,"bedroom","ep057"
"29991",1170,"I like the pendant lights but this room","ep057"
"29992",1173,"seems a little bit smaller than the","ep057"
"29993",1176,"other bedroom we saw","ep057"
"29994",1179,"it is slightly smaller we can always","ep057"
"29995",1182,"switch it up and use the other one","ep057"
"29996",1185,"that's the master bedroom okay yeah the","ep057"
"29997",1188,"pressure of keeping my new wife happy is","ep057"
"29998",1191,"certainly mounting I love how close it","ep057"
"29999",1194,"is to the beach and downtown Avalon but","ep057"
"30000",1197,"it really doesn't have a view so maybe","ep057"
"30001",1200,"not the ideal choice for Christine you","ep057"
"30002",1203,"have the bathroom","ep057"
"30003",1206,"Diderot air oh great I like that there's","ep057"

"30013",1236,"yeah I love these windows what are these","ep057"
"30014",1239,"called the louvers they're really common","ep057"
"30015",1242,"in Australian homes because you get that","ep057"
"30016",1245,"natural air flow just hope the mozzies","ep057"
"30017",1248,"don't come after you I know do you guys","ep057"
"30018",1251,"want to check out the after area","ep057"
"30019",1254,"absolutely look at this pool the pool is","ep057"
"30020",1257,"amazing he's swimming and grilling at","ep057"
"30021",1260,"the same time no it's like a vacation","ep057"
"30022",1263,"home I really really love the backyard","ep057"
"30023",1266,"it's great love it Ben's eyes lit up","ep057"
"30024",1269,"when he saw that pool so I feel like","ep057"
"30025",1272,"there's gonna be a little tension as we","ep057"
"30026",1275,"try to figure out which home is for us","ep057"
"30027",1278,"because I think we both have the first","ep057"
"30028",1281,"choice and they don't think it's the","ep057"
"30029",1284,"same house I love the open layout and","ep057"
"30030",1287,"it's very unique there's a lot of","ep057"
"30031",1290,"character in this home which I think we","ep057"
"30032",1293,"really like and I love that it's dog","ep057"
"30033",1296,"friendly for me the location is great I","ep057"
"30034",1299,"mean a few minutes to the beach and a","ep057"
"30035",1302,"few minutes to downtown Avalon with the","ep057"
"30036",1305,"pubs and restaurants I love that","ep057"
"30037",1308,"I think the thing we're giving up there","ep057"
"30038",1311,"is any views of the water though it's","ep057"
"30039",1314,"just a smaller view of water the pool","ep057"
"30040",1317,"yeah","ep057"
"30041",1320,"what really consider a view of water I","ep057"
"30042",1323,"think it's stressful try and decide on","ep057"
"30043",1326,"where we're gonna pick a home I really","ep057"
"30044",1329,"want the right location Kristine is","ep057"
"30045",1332,"pushing more for a view and one of us is","ep057"
"30046",1335,"certainly gonna have to compromise that","ep057"
"30047",1338,"house was exactly what I was envisioning","ep057"
"30048",1341,"when I knew we were looking for a home","ep057"
"30049",1344,"up here probably not the most practical","ep057"
"30050",1347,"house I don't know if I can give up that","ep057"
"30051",1350,"view base when Ben and Christine found","ep057"
"30052",1353,"each other","ep057"
"30053",1356,"they also found a new sense of purpose","ep057"
"30054",1359,"we've kind of left a lot of friends and","ep057"
"30055",1362,"family we had some very good careers","ep057"
"30056",1365,"which has been really hard to do but we","ep057"
"30057",1368,"wanted to focus on ourselves the","ep057"
"30058",1371,"adventurous pair is looking to find a","ep057"
"30059",1374,"rental that has it all central location","ep057"
"30060",1377,"great views and a place their dog","ep057"
"30061",1380,"Tallulah can bury your bones so amazing","ep057"
"30062",1383,"but there's trouble in paradise","ep057"
"30063",1386,"Christine wants a view and on their","ep057"
"30064",1389,"budget that means giving up Ben's","ep057"
"30065",1392,"beachside dream","ep057"
"30066",1395,"what do you think the townhouse was","ep057"
"30067",1398,"definitely the most practical option","ep057"
"30068",1401,"1,800 per month I love the location so","ep057"
"30069",1404,"close to the beach and Tallulah is gonna","ep057"
"30070",1407,"love this backyard this would be here","ep057"
"30071",1410,"top two ain't that thing but it lacked","ep057"
"30072",1413,"the view or any character seems pretty","ep057"
"30073",1416,"generic I really like the view house","ep057"
"30074",1419,"I loved that as soon as you walk in the","ep057"
"30075",1422,"front door you see a very experience of","ep057"
"30076",1425,"view of the bay could stare at this all","ep057"
"30077",1428,"day they had tons of character the only","ep057"
"30078",1431,"thing is it's not very dog-friendly is","ep057"
"30079",1434,"this the only access to the house it is","ep057"
"30080",1437,"the only access we might need to build a","ep057"
"30081",1440,"slide the pool house unbelievable with","ep057"
"30082",1443,"the pool swimming and grilling at the","ep057"
"30083",1446,"same time a ton of character they love","ep057"
"30084",1449,"all the cool light fixtures and fans and","ep057"
"30085",1452,"the location is perfect but there were","ep057"
"30086",1455,"no views in the water","ep057"
"30087",1458,"[Music]","ep057"
"30088",1461,"I think the townhouse has to go it was","ep057"
"30089",1464,"under budget but I think it lacked any","ep057"
"30090",1467,"wow factor and no view and no view so","ep057"
"30091",1470,"that leaves us with a pool house and the","ep057"
"30092",1473,"view house I know you really love that","ep057"
"30093",1476,"view house I do love the view house","ep057"
"30094",1479,"I loved that as soon as you walk in the","ep057"
"30095",1482,"front door you see a very experience of","ep057"
"30096",1485,"view of the bay that house was exactly","ep057"
"30097",1488,"what I was envisioning when I knew we","ep057"
"30098",1491,"were looking for a home up here it's","ep057"
"30099",1494,"kind of a beach bungalow and I feel like","ep057"
"30100",1497,"we'd be really happy in that","ep057"
"30101",1500,"indoor/outdoor living space probably not","ep057"
"30102",1503,"the most practical house because of the","ep057"
"30103",1506,"fact it's not great for Tallulah and I","ep057"
"30104",1509,"don't think it's her number one choice","ep057"
"30105",1512,"no outdoor space really for her in the","ep057"
"30106",1515,"location I mean we're a much further","ep057"
"30107",1518,"distance from the beach and all the","ep057"
"30108",1521,"shops and restaurants and pubs the pool","ep057"
"30109",1524,"house has the location that I absolutely","ep057"
"30110",1527,"wanted moving to Australia and I thought","ep057"
"30111",1530,"the pool was a huge added bonus I think","ep057"
"30112",1533,"bottom line is one of us is gonna have","ep057"
"30113",1536,"to compromise view versus location yep","ep057"
"30114",1539,"but I want you to be happy I want you to","ep057"
"30115",1542,"be happy","ep057"
"30116",1545,"seeing your face as we walk down that","ep057"
"30117",1548,"massive staircase at the view house that","ep057"
"30118",1551,"view is amazing the open layout it's","ep057"
"30119",1554,"unique I knew that's the kind of","ep057"
"30120",1557,"character you were looking for I think","ep057"
"30121",1560,"we should go with the view house okay","ep057"
"30122",1563,"it's a sign in so excited we're both","ep057"
"30123",1566,"really happy with our decision to leave","ep057"
"30124",1569,"the rat race with relocates Australia","ep057"
"30125",1572,"we've absolutely been loving it the beef","ep057"
"30126",1575,"here 2054 a grill this thing's really","ep057"
"30127",1578,"good we call it a barbecue it's a big","ep057"
"30128",1581,"sigh relief for me that Christine so","ep057"
"30129",1584,"happy you realize that Australian miles","ep057"
"30130",1587,"are born when barbecuing in their DNA","ep057"
"30131",1590,"then where'd you born that's right we","ep057"
"30132",1593,"made the choice of the view home one of","ep057"
"30133",1596,"us had to compromise come on me and so","ep057"
"30134",1599,"happy I did it's an amazing home it's","ep057"
"30135",1602,"bright its airy and I love the deck who","ep057"
"30136",1605,"cares if it's a little impractical","ep057"
"30137",1608,"enjoying a cup of coffee or tea look at","ep057"
"30138",1611,"this view I know it's amazing this house","ep057"
"30139",1614,"definitely wasn't the most practical","ep057"
"30140",1617,"choice come and it's not the most dog","ep057"
"30141",1620,"friendly either but we've made it work","ep057"
"30142",1623,"because we spent a lot of time at the","ep057"
"30143",1626,"dog beaches the dog parks and I think","ep057"
"30144",1629,"everyone's happy with the overall","ep057"
"30145",1632,"situation I really think it's fulfilling","ep057"
"30146",1635,"a circle of life where my parents had me","ep057"
"30147",1638,"here in Australia and now back here with","ep057"

"30376",690,"price is really good it's a fairly small","ep058"
"30377",693,"kitchen but I think it's average France","ep058"
"30378",696,"I didn't see where it needed any","ep058"
"30379",699,"renovation I like that","ep058"
"30380",702,"well it's a good-sized room oh I love","ep058"
"30381",705,"the beam look at that big that's","ep058"

"30386",720,"probably believe we could do mm-hmm","ep058"
"30387",723,"and it connects quickly with a dining","ep058"
"30388",726,"room okay okay","ep058"
"30389",729,"well it's a good-sized room it's kind of","ep058"
"30390",732,"an odd floorplan I don't know how old is","ep058"
"30391",735,"this house but I would say maybe around","ep058"
"30392",738,"1600 s so the layouts at that time you","ep058"
"30393",741,"know we're much different okay let's go","ep058"
"30394",744,"upstairs to the bedroom well carefully","ep058"

"30396",750,"could use a little renovation yes here's","ep058"
"30397",753,"the first bedroom","ep058"
"30398",756,"oh very small very small from a rental","ep058"
"30399",759,"perspective you know when we're not here","ep058"
"30400",762,"but this would be well received I think","ep058"
"30401",765,"it's still decent size plus you have","ep058"
"30402",768,"three bedrooms okay I don't think this","ep058"
"30403",771,"house would be a concern I think","ep058"
"30404",774,"anything that's less expensive for you","ep058"
"30405",777,"you're willing to move in that direction","ep058"
"30406",780,"I might compromise that dog Oh hon so","ep058"

"30422",828,"there's things I don't care about it the","ep058"
"30423",831,"configuration upstairs is very odd the","ep058"
"30424",834,"price is right with money left over for","ep058"
"30425",837,"renovations I like that it does shock me","ep058"
"30426",840,"a little bit that he's open to it","ep058"
"30427",843,"however I think he looks at the selling","ep058"
"30428",846,"price and then he just kind of thinks we","ep058"

"30815",543,"literally a cave shower and I just think","ep059"
"30816",546,"we would have to rearrange this because","ep059"
"30817",549,"there's maybe potential but this is","ep059"

"30828",582,"negotiate this in no doubt okay the","ep059"
"30829",585,"trundle bed option that we found was","ep059"
"30830",588,"awesome that puts us in a position where","ep059"
"30831",591,"we can market this home as a vacation","ep059"
"30832",594,"rental that can sleep nine potentially","ep059"
"30833",597,"10 people annual revenue I think it's","ep059"

"30835",603,"range Paul is definitely the financial","ep059"
"30836",606,"planner of our family but for me I","ep059"

"30839",615,"okay this one's a little bit bigger it's","ep059"

"30850",648,"location is perfect you know from a","ep059"
"30851",651,"vacation rental standpoint this is the","ep059"
"30852",654,"direction we want to go","ep059"
"30853",657,"I think the cottage look of it is super","ep059"
"30854",660,"cute but it's definitely a fixer-upper","ep059"
"30855",663,"and that's not what I wanted I think","ep059"
"30856",666,"what I want to see next I definitely","ep059"
"30857",669,"want to see the Pacific Lodge okay","ep059"
"30858",672,"but getting to Pauls Pacific Lodge is a","ep059"
"30859",675,"bit of a trek we are completely isolated","ep059"
"30860",678,"on our own but I like that there's no","ep059"
"30861",681,"other houses around no other people so","ep059"
"30862",684,"that's nice","ep059"
"30863",687,"[Music]","ep059"
"30864",690,"this is a great area surrounded with all","ep059"

"30866",696,"market for a vacation slash rental cabin","ep059"
"30867",699,"in the small mountain resort town of","ep059"
"30868",702,"Shaver Lake California however making","ep059"
"30869",705,"sure the home appeals to renters is more","ep059"
"30870",708,"of a priority for Paul than it is for","ep059"
"30871",711,"Amanda I am very much more family minded","ep059"
"30872",714,"when I'm thinking of this place and I","ep059"
"30873",717,"know Paul is thinking let's make some","ep059"
"30874",720,"money working with a budget of $400,000","ep059"
"30875",723,"they've seen a cozy cottage perfect for","ep059"
"30876",726,"Amanda but it needed a lot of work and","ep059"
"30877",729,"Paul prefers more of a Pacific Lodge","ep059"
"30878",732,"style look at this view that's beautiful","ep059"
"30879",735,"I'm showing you this house today - Paul","ep059"

"30882",744,"we're 10 to 12 minutes away from the","ep059"
"30883",747,"village maybe 15 18 minutes away from","ep059"
"30884",750,"the lake it did take a long time to get","ep059"
"30885",753,"up here you can't even see a house","ep059"
"30886",756,"we are completely isolated on our own","ep059"
"30887",759,"but I like that there's no other houses","ep059"
"30888",762,"around no other people so that's nice hi","ep059"

"30896",786,"half you're gonna find the inside very","ep059"

"30899",795,"divided into it's listed at $379,000","ep059"
"30900",798,"enter revenue maybe 15 to 25 30 thousand","ep059"

"30907",819,"great job with this what do you think","ep059"
"30908",822,"about the openness I think it's great","ep059"
"30909",825,"there's a lot of room we could have the","ep059"
"30910",828,"whole family here I could see us doing","ep059"

"30924",870,"really nice job of complementing","ep059"
"30925",873,"high-end appliances what still a rustic","ep059"
"30926",876,"feel and then wood-burning stove does","ep059"

"30932",894,"the bedrooms back in the opposite corner","ep059"
"30933",897,"okay it's small I mean I like what they","ep059"
"30934",900,"did with the furniture here is this","ep059"

"30938",912,"like that they head upstairs to look at","ep059"
"30939",915,"the loft this is a Donna massive loft","ep059"
"30940",918,"that concerns me","ep059"
"30941",921,"honestly I feel like this is a","ep059"
"30942",924,"deal-breaker this is just","ep059"
"30943",927,"yeah the fabric separating yeah I love","ep059"
"30944",930,"the idea that we're sleeping six people","ep059"
"30945",933,"up here but I mean do you want to sleep","ep059"
"30946",936,"this close to everybody all right a","ep059"
"30947",939,"little tiny bath I think it's simple it","ep059"
"30948",942,"does the job but there is no shower and","ep059"
"30949",945,"there's no bath to have a half bath","ep059"
"30950",948,"upstairs where you're sleeping six","ep059"
"30951",951,"people that's just a equation for","ep059"
"30952",954,"disaster there's your walk-in closet no","ep059"
"30953",957,"that's a closet","ep059"
"30954",960,"this is awesome oh my gosh","ep059"
"30955",963,"so what do you think of a house you have","ep059"
"30956",966,"the pine vaulted ceilings it is the","ep059"
"30957",969,"definition of a Pacific lodge it's not","ep059"
"30958",972,"my cottage but I love the charm of it I","ep059"
"30959",975,"love the character it's move-in-ready","ep059"
"30960",978,"but the big things you know that really","ep059"
"30961",981,"concern me is the distance how far took","ep059"
"30962",984,"us get out here the whole loft situation","ep059"
"30963",987,"really cool idea but not as a bedroom so","ep059"
"30964",990,"is there something else that you can","ep059"
"30965",993,"show us it's maybe closer to town that's","ep059"
"30966",996,"more aligned with features of a rental I","ep059"
"30967",999,"think so location and size aren't an","ep059"
"30968",1002,"issue with this next house but it too","ep059"
"30969",1005,"has its issues I don't like the gray","ep059"
"30970",1008,"yeah it's kind of bland new parents Paul","ep059"
"30971",1011,"and Amanda are searching the small","ep059"
"30972",1014,"mountain resort town of Shaver Lake","ep059"
"30973",1017,"California for a vacation cabin that","ep059"
"30974",1020,"they can rent out when they're not using","ep059"
"30975",1023,"it but in their $400,000 price range","ep059"
"30976",1026,"they're having trouble finding a place","ep059"
"30977",1029,"that balances her wish for a","ep059"
"30978",1032,"family-friendly cozy cottage and his","ep059"
"30979",1035,"desire for a Pacific Lodge style home","ep059"
"30980",1038,"that he thinks will get the best rental","ep059"
"30981",1041,"rate","ep059"
"30982",1044,"so far they've seen a cottage that was","ep059"
"30983",1047,"within walking distance of the village","ep059"
"30984",1050,"and lake but it needed work and was too","ep059"
"30985",1053,"close to the neighbors for Amanda","ep059"
"30986",1056,"then they saw Pacific lodge with amazing","ep059"
"30987",1059,"views but it was isolated and the","ep059"
"30988",1062,"bedroom layout wasn't ideal","ep059"
"30989",1065,"[Music]","ep059"
"30990",1068,"- beautiful day so now their real-estate","ep059"
"30991",1071,"agents lined up a place he hopes will be","ep059"
"30992",1074,"a good compromise just a 5-minute drive","ep059"
"30993",1077,"to the village and ten minutes to the","ep059"
"30994",1080,"lake this home isn't too remote and has","ep059"
"30995",1083,"been completely updated very traditional","ep059"
"30996",1086,"no it's not the Pacific lodge that I","ep059"
"30997",1089,"like not my cottage either but it's","ep059"
"30998",1092,"still cute well it was built in 1992","ep059"
"30999",1095,"it's got three bedrooms and three","ep059"
"31000",1098,"bathrooms it also has a little upstairs","ep059"
"31001",1101,"loft and bonus it's got two car garage","ep059"
"31002",1104,"oh nice with easy access so give me the","ep059"
"31003",1107,"other side of the equation the catch","ep059"
"31004",1110,"yes 449 is it asposed okay and the","ep059"
"31005",1113,"furniture and decor is not included I","ep059"
"31006",1116,"don't like the gray yeah it's kind of","ep059"
"31007",1119,"bland I like this deck out here oh wow","ep059"
"31008",1122,"this is beautiful this is the Pacific","ep059"
"31009",1125,"Lodge I was looking for I love that they","ep059"
"31010",1128,"painted this white but then it's nice","ep059"
"31011",1131,"that they left some of it exposed so","ep059"
"31012",1134,"this is a little a little tricky I'm","ep059"
"31013",1137,"thinking about Christian with these","ep059"
"31014",1140,"stairs just dangerous to me I just think","ep059"
"31015",1143,"about the kids running up and down the","ep059"
"31016",1146,"stairs following up and down the stairs","ep059"
"31017",1149,"oh wow this is beautiful this is it I","ep059"
"31018",1152,"love the wood I love the stone oh and","ep059"
"31019",1155,"this deck wraps all the way around","ep059"
"31020",1158,"that's awesome gosh the price tag does","ep059"
"31021",1161,"it's making more sense now","ep059"
"31022",1164,"this is really nice this kitchen is","ep059"
"31023",1167,"beautiful look at how modern everything","ep059"

"31027",1179,"kitchen I want something clean and want","ep059"

"31029",1185,"does it this is perfect","ep059"
"31030",1188,"this is open-concept how far out does","ep059"
"31031",1191,"this property go only another 50 or 60","ep059"
"31032",1194,"feet","ep059"
"31033",1197,"that's enough space for a fire pit we've","ep059"
"31034",1200,"got that open land though that is","ep059"
"31035",1203,"amazing you see how you just avoided the","ep059"
"31036",1206,"fire pit altogether is there a hot tub","ep059"
"31037",1209,"no all right this is a win they take a","ep059"

"31430",810,"tight-knit community it feels just like","ep060"
"31431",813,"home where I grew up","ep060"
"31432",816,"it's two bedrooms with an office a","ep060"
"31433",819,"little under 1,600 square feet and it's","ep060"
"31434",822,"listed at 240 which is way under budget","ep060"
"31435",825,"for you yeah that actually is really","ep060"
"31436",828,"affordable it's pretty small","ep060"
"31437",831,"yeah but been a really tall ceiling and","ep060"
"31438",834,"I really like the windows I mean this is","ep060"
"31439",837,"more light than our rental I like the","ep060"
"31440",840,"openness to the kitchen and see everyone","ep060"
"31441",843,"through yeah you know there is a dining","ep060"
"31442",846,"room right through here okay","ep060"
"31443",849,"this is the dining room ooh it'd be","ep060"
"31444",852,"difficult to get a table in here yeah","ep060"
"31445",855,"then we better have like a really tiny","ep060"
"31446",858,"table yeah I like how modern the","ep060"
"31447",861,"countertops are it's no texturing smooth","ep060"

"31452",876,"about this house is how updated it is I","ep060"
"31453",879,"didn't realize I could find such a","ep060"
"31454",882,"modern looking house in this town this","ep060"
"31455",885,"is the guest room oh it's pretty small","ep060"
"31456",888,"Wow you could fit maybe one guest in","ep060"
"31457",891,"like a single bed we have a lot of","ep060"
"31458",894,"people come and stay for multiple days","ep060"
"31459",897,"so we need a little bigger area to","ep060"
"31460",900,"entertain","ep060"
"31461",903,"this is the only bathroom on the main","ep060"
"31462",906,"floor so it would serve as the master","ep060"
"31463",909,"bathroom really I mean you're having the","ep060"
"31464",912,"guest share space with a master I don't","ep060"
"31465",915,"really like that I really want a master","ep060"
"31466",918,"bathroom let's go take a look at the","ep060"
"31467",921,"master bedroom then it's alright size I","ep060"
"31468",924,"do like the windows in three windows","ep060"
"31469",927,"south-facing that gives a lot of light","ep060"
"31470",930,"in here that's true for this bedroom","ep060"
"31471",933,"that is like the best view I've seen so","ep060"
"31472",936,"far okay well let's go outside and check","ep060"
"31473",939,"out the backyard Wow look at this big","ep060"
"31474",942,"backyard like a big the trees are yeah","ep060"
"31475",945,"and actually I mean it's sort of blocks","ep060"
"31476",948,"off the houses for the neighbors I know","ep060"
"31477",951,"it's to give us some privacy yeah but it","ep060"
"31478",954,"still is pretty small I mean it's kind","ep060"
"31479",957,"of limiting I'm concerned about the yard","ep060"
"31480",960,"isn't quite large enough for the animals","ep060"
"31481",963,"that I want to have chickens and pigs","ep060"
"31482",966,"need enough space for the animals as","ep060"
"31483",969,"well as enough space to keep your","ep060"
"31484",972,"neighbors happy to back inside they head","ep060"
"31485",975,"down to the basement so let's go into","ep060"
"31486",978,"the bedroom first these two small be a","ep060"
"31487",981,"bedroom but it can work for my office","ep060"
"31488",984,"yeah so straight across the hall is","ep060"
"31489",987,"another bathroom that is some bright","ep060"
"31490",990,"flooring oh yeah like I'm in a bowling","ep060"
"31491",993,"alley","ep060"
"31492",996,"but hey I mean it's bigger than the","ep060"
"31493",999,"master bathroom upstairs but there is a","ep060"
"31494",1002,"laundry room back around the corner oh","ep060"
"31495",1005,"yeah yeah I like it it's a little bigger","ep060"
"31496",1008,"than a living room this would be the","ep060"
"31497",1011,"room that we can hang out in so we can","ep060"
"31498",1014,"host the guests upstairs but then we","ep060"
"31499",1017,"could put like a couch and TV down here","ep060"
"31500",1020,"and relax you know yeah media down here","ep060"
"31501",1023,"makes sense","ep060"
"31502",1026,"the price is fantastic on that price is","ep060"
"31503",1029,"so nice it was modern there's not much","ep060"
"31504",1032,"renovation that would go into it","ep060"
"31505",1035,"everything here is really updated modern","ep060"
"31506",1038,"I really like I feel like you like the","ep060"
"31507",1041,"kitchen right yeah I mean that's big","ep060"
"31508",1044,"enough for you and that was a big deal","ep060"
"31509",1047,"but I feel like the house is kind of","ep060"
"31510",1050,"small and right on top of the neighbors","ep060"
"31511",1053,"like we're definitely living in the city","ep060"
"31512",1056,"yeah but I find like the yard and the","ep060"
"31513",1059,"house to be super manageable I mean that","ep060"
"31514",1062,"also restricts what animals we can have","ep060"
"31515",1065,"here you know just two chickens in the","ep060"
"31516",1068,"gardens gonna be pretty small yeah","ep060"
"31517",1071,"actually it's big in a small the fact","ep060"
"31518",1074,"that there's no master bathroom sort of","ep060"
"31519",1077,"a disappointment so now an is lined up a","ep060"
"31520",1080,"place with more land and a master","ep060"
"31521",1083,"bathroom but can Jamie get past the","ep060"
"31522",1086,"style not a big fan of the wooden","ep060"
"31523",1089,"exterior","ep060"
"31524",1092,"[Music]","ep060"
"31525",1095,"Ryan and Jamie have up to 400 grand to","ep060"

"31533",1119,"country for him and a cottage in town","ep060"
"31534",1122,"for her but neither place was a perfect","ep060"
"31535",1125,"fit so today their broker Anne has lined","ep060"
"31536",1128,"up a home a mile outside of Winthrop","ep060"
"31537",1131,"she thinks could be the perfect","ep060"
"31538",1134,"compromise it's sitting on a piece of","ep060"
"31539",1137,"property it's a little bit under 4 acres","ep060"
"31540",1140,"there's plenty of outbuildings on this","ep060"
"31541",1143,"property","ep060"
"31542",1146,"they'll make having livestock and","ep060"
"31543",1149,"growing plants really easy Wow what up","ep060"

"31547",1161,"it's a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath","ep060"
"31548",1164,"it's a little over 1,600 square feet and","ep060"
"31549",1167,"the price is at $400,000 that's right at","ep060"
"31550",1170,"the top of our budget","ep060"
"31551",1173,"yeah it's pretty expensive there's a lot","ep060"
"31552",1176,"of outbuildings on this property and","ep060"
"31553",1179,"they're worth a lot of money so that","ep060"
"31554",1182,"really has to be taken into","ep060"
"31555",1185,"consideration when you're looking at the","ep060"
"31556",1188,"price tag of $400,000 like that you can","ep060"
"31557",1191,"see the river straight from the entryway","ep060"

"31562",1206,"kitchen is really too small and pretty","ep060"
"31563",1209,"outdated I think that would be one of","ep060"
"31564",1212,"the first things we'd have to work on if","ep060"
"31565",1215,"we wanted to participate Wow look at the","ep060"
"31566",1218,"river yeah Wow and there's an outdoor","ep060"

"31571",1233,"it you know an older couple lived here","ep060"
"31572",1236,"so this is really easy to disassemble","ep060"
"31573",1239,"ooh I don't like the wood paneling yeah","ep060"
"31574",1242,"it is sort of a cosmetic nightmare huh","ep060"
"31575",1245,"you know you can paint paneling and that","ep060"
"31576",1248,"would completely tone this down and","ep060"
"31577",1251,"really brighten this room up it would","ep060"
"31578",1254,"need a lot of updating yeah","ep060"
"31579",1257,"still more wood paneling in here Oh a","ep060"
"31580",1260,"lighter wood paneling really good I","ep060"

"31584",1272,"too so I think the room is bigger than","ep060"
"31585",1275,"it appears you know actually this isn't","ep060"
"31586",1278,"the master bedroom there's another","ep060"
"31587",1281,"master bedroom upstairs","ep060"
"31588",1284,"this would be more like the guest room","ep060"
"31589",1287,"their own separate bathrooms oh the home","ep060"
"31590",1290,"actually has really good bones but as","ep060"
"31591",1293,"far as cosmetically there's still so","ep060"
"31592",1296,"much of a facelift to do and I don't","ep060"
"31593",1299,"know if we have the finances to do that","ep060"

"32554",1083,"extra bedroom with probably no way on me","ep062"
"32555",1086,"over time and the commuting as well this","ep062"

"32563",1110,"and location closer to central London","ep062"
"32564",1113,"that's fantastic just my biggest worry","ep062"
"32565",1116,"is being second bedroom being so small","ep062"
"32566",1119,"Elsa you know it's the commute for me to","ep062"
"32567",1122,"go to work in the morning and come home","ep062"
"32568",1125,"so you know might be you know that's why","ep062"

"32570",1131,"there really I like I really like it","ep062"
"32571",1134,"quirky loft space and Chandler's cross a","ep062"

"32592",1197,"about 30 minutes to the hospital it's a","ep062"
"32593",1200,"bit of a drive from your work yeah and","ep062"
"32594",1203,"twice as far from the history and","ep062"
"32595",1206,"architecture of central London yeah the","ep062"

"32598",1215,"and places that we're just really","ep062"

"32601",1224,"perfect place for doing some well I told","ep062"
"32602",1227,"open it was and having it be in the","ep062"
"32603",1230,"country I think it'd be really nice for","ep062"
"32604",1233,"the kids to enjoy the nature but I think","ep062"
"32605",1236,"remote to it I don't know if we wanted","ep062"
"32606",1239,"that kind of lifestyle house 2 is close","ep062"
"32607",1242,"to Chad's work in Uxbridge","ep062"
"32608",1245,"excellent that's really good and in fact","ep062"

"32622",1287,"like and midway between Huck's bridge","ep062"
"32623",1290,"and central London it is charming from","ep062"
"32624",1293,"the outside nice family neighborhood but","ep062"
"32625",1296,"living space is a problem a bit small","ep062"
"32626",1299,"for two kids though and we would need","ep062"
"32627",1302,"another bed","ep062"
"32628",1305,"[Music]","ep062"

"32630",1311,"30 minutes drive to work maybe longer","ep062"
"32631",1314,"depending on traffic probably my least","ep062"
"32632",1317,"favorite of the three day we saw yeah","ep062"
"32633",1320,"having the second bedroom being really","ep062"
"32634",1323,"small I I do wonder but how we make that","ep062"
"32635",1326,"work","ep062"
"32636",1329,"I think we should probably take that one","ep062"
"32637",1332,"off our list agreed what do you think","ep062"
"32638",1335,"about that blue house well I liked how","ep062"

"32640",1341,"that we looked at that was his own house","ep062"
"32641",1344,"too far away from what we need to be","ep062"
"32642",1347,"close to do you think about the one","ep062"
"32643",1350,"close to my work though I just really","ep062"
"32644",1353,"worry about the budget because it is","ep062"
"32645",1356,"over budget I love how it's just less","ep062"

"32650",1371,"there it was good with the budget yeah","ep062"
"32651",1374,"but yeah there are a lot of drawbacks to","ep062"
"32652",1377,"like one bedroom that's there if you can","ep062"
"32653",1380,"call it that we'd have to establish a","ep062"
"32654",1383,"place for ourselves to sleep downstairs","ep062"
"32655",1386,"a kitchen I don't think is workable you","ep062"
"32656",1389,"know in this current state we'd have to","ep062"
"32657",1392,"invest in that I think that even though","ep062"
"32658",1395,"we'd be saving money with the rent be","ep062"
"32659",1398,"paying a lot more in other ways too yes","ep062"

"32824",378,"the master bedroom yeah this is huge","ep063"
"32825",381,"that's cool the neighbors though you can","ep063"
"32826",384,"see right to them this doesn't look like","ep063"
"32827",387,"my ideal location I don't really see any","ep063"
"32828",390,"space to lay out and relax this Togo","ep063"
"32829",393,"take a look at the living room yes and","ep063"
"32830",396,"the light comes in right here because","ep063"
"32831",399,"this is so I really like that","ep063"
"32832",402,"Kendra let's try to see if we can find a","ep063"
"32833",405,"room for you as well","ep063"
"32834",408,"okay there's space for a nice small","ep063"
"32835",411,"class in here should be able to fit","ep063"
"32836",414,"eight nine people in here or something","ep063"
"32837",417,"Mikal is pretty excited about this","ep063"
"32838",420,"apartment but I would really love a","ep063"
"32839",423,"little more space for me to do yoga and","ep063"
"32840",426,"where we're both happy definitely small","ep063"
"32841",429,"squeezin I mean that's what you get when","ep063"
"32842",432,"you're downtown I really want Kendra to","ep063"
"32843",435,"feel at home here but I think that she's","ep063"
"32844",438,"gonna have to get used to the city","ep063"
"32845",441,"because it's definitely different than","ep063"
"32846",444,"it is in California here we have the","ep063"
"32847",447,"courtyard where you will be able to get","ep063"
"32848",450,"outside a little bit it's green it's","ep063"
"32849",453,"beautiful to look at but it's not really","ep063"
"32850",456,"maybe a space we would hang out in I","ep063"
"32851",459,"mean the stillness and benches over","ep063"
"32852",462,"there","ep063"
"32853",465,"second ouais in the city anything that's","ep063"
"32854",468,"pretty I really like that it's a big","ep063"
"32855",471,"spacious apartment and I really like","ep063"
"32856",474,"that it gets a lot of natural light","ep063"
"32857",477,"there's room to teach yoga in and feel","ep063"
"32858",480,"like that it's under budget I'm happy","ep063"
"32859",483,"there's a balcony but it is pretty small","ep063"
"32860",486,"but the location it's pretty much what I","ep063"
"32861",489,"had in mind","ep063"
"32862",492,"yeah but it's not really in nature it's","ep063"
"32863",495,"very much in the city I think it kind of","ep063"
"32864",498,"blows my mind","ep063"
"32865",501,"[Music]","ep063"
"32866",504,"Patrick gets Kendra closer to nature you","ep063"
"32867",507,"feel a little bit more out of the city","ep063"
"32868",510,"being here but mikkel isn't giving up on","ep063"
"32869",513,"city living just yet","ep063"
"32870",516,"you our city won't really do that trick","ep063"
"32871",519,"for me it's okay oh who suits Kendra","ep063"
"32872",522,"nice lifestyle because it's really","ep063"
"32873",525,"active there's a lot of outdoor activity","ep063"
"32874",528,"there's a lot of nice for us so it kind","ep063"
"32875",531,"of just sums up the way that we like to","ep063"
"32876",534,"live Kendra and Mikkel are upgrading","ep063"
"32877",537,"their long-distance status to full-time","ep063"
"32878",540,"cohabitants in Mickle's native Denmark","ep063"
"32879",543,"Kendra moving to California is obviously","ep063"
"32880",546,"quite the challenge because she has to","ep063"
"32881",549,"create a business and life here and I","ep063"
"32882",552,"think that it's gonna be difficult for","ep063"
"32883",555,"some paths yes I he has a life set up","ep063"
"32884",558,"for him already","ep063"
"32885",561,"he has his school program he has his","ep063"
"32886",564,"life pretty much planned and for me","ep063"
"32887",567,"everything's brand new having access to","ep063"
"32888",570,"nature being close to nature that's","ep063"
"32889",573,"really important to me because it would","ep063"
"32890",576,"be really nice teaching yoga in a home","ep063"
"32891",579,"that we can relax him and also I just","ep063"
"32892",582,"need to get out of city life sometimes","ep063"
"32893",585,"they both know they're stubborn so it's","ep063"
"32894",588,"no surprise heads are already butting","ep063"
"32895",591,"over house 1 this apartment is in the","ep063"
"32896",594,"very heart of all who's that it's","ep063"
"32897",597,"perfect there's a lot of people it's a","ep063"
"32898",600,"little noisy I mean that's what you get","ep063"
"32899",603,"when you're downtown it's a big spacious","ep063"
"32900",606,"apartment and I really like that it gets","ep063"
"32901",609,"a lot of natural life but I would like a","ep063"
"32902",612,"place where we're both happy I really","ep063"
"32903",615,"like that there's room to teach yoga and","ep063"
"32904",618,"and that's under budget but it's not","ep063"
"32905",621,"really in nature I think it kind of","ep063"
"32906",624,"blows my mind","ep063"
"32907",627,"[Music]","ep063"
"32908",630,"Patrick knows Kendra would rather Center","ep063"
"32909",633,"her yoga business in a calm natural","ep063"
"32910",636,"setting","ep063"
"32911",639,"so he's picked a property that will","ep063"
"32912",642,"summon the right mood even if that means","ep063"
"32913",645,"missing on location for mikkel this","ep063"
"32914",648,"apartment is the nature apartment so","ep063"
"32915",651,"that's definitely gonna be something for","ep063"
"32916",654,"you yeah I like the street there are a","ep063"
"32917",657,"lot of trees here it's beautiful and","ep063"
"32918",660,"pretty quiet and you're right next to","ep063"
"32919",663,"the water and the park that's perfect","ep063"
"32920",666,"this is further out than I actually want","ep063"
"32921",669,"it to be but hopefully you'll still","ep063"
"32922",672,"consider this it's a two-bedroom","ep063"
"32923",675,"one-bathroom but it's a little bit over","ep063"
"32924",678,"your budget it's $1400 a month hmm we'll","ep063"
"32925",681,"have to really see if it's worth it all","ep063"
"32926",684,"right guys come on in","ep063"
"32927",687,"[Music]","ep063"
"32928",690,"just come on in here you have the","ep063"

"32931",699,"like the lighting that's super nice","ep063"
"32932",702,"maybe we would need a little less stuff","ep063"
"32933",705,"in here maybe plenty of room for me to","ep063"
"32934",708,"have some people over and teach them","ep063"
"32935",711,"yeah I really like this view and you","ep063"
"32936",714,"feel a little bit more out of the city","ep063"
"32937",717,"being here you are sensitive yes I like","ep063"
"32938",720,"that I think it's maybe was putting a","ep063"
"32939",723,"lot of pressure on me to be close to the","ep063"
"32940",726,"center of the city but I want to feel a","ep063"
"32941",729,"sense of comfort into the apartment oh","ep063"
"32942",732,"this is nice master bedroom it's not","ep063"
"32943",735,"that picture what is it look at how big","ep063"
"32944",738,"the bed is yeah well that's not a really","ep063"
"32945",741,"space for you yeah all right yeah you","ep063"
"32946",744,"like the bedroom","ep063"
"32947",747,"yeah you not so much I guess well let me","ep063"
"32948",750,"take you to see the kitchen then yeah","ep063"
"32949",753,"pretty sure you both got like that","ep063"
"32950",756,"this is nice yeah good big spacious","ep063"
"32951",759,"kitchen I like that lots of light coming","ep063"
"32952",762,"in those 10 it's like an indoor outdoor","ep063"
"32953",765,"space kind of that's really great","ep063"
"32954",768,"yeah it also has a small bedroom","ep063"
"32955",771,"actually oh wow","ep063"
"32956",774,"it is small it's quite cramped yeah yeah","ep063"
"32957",777,"maybe we could get a fold-out couch","ep063"
"32958",780,"I think if Kendra had it her way we'll","ep063"
"32959",783,"be living in a tree house in the park","ep063"
"32960",786,"somewhere but won't really do that trait","ep063"
"32961",789,"for me it's okay yes wow this is great","ep063"
"32962",792,"this is amazing it's such a big balcony","ep063"
"32963",795,"could have six people out here barbecue","ep063"
"32964",798,"look at that courtyard it's amazing how","ep063"
"32965",801,"much grass I can teach a small yoga","ep063"
"32966",804,"class outside in the summer that's cool","ep063"
"32967",807,"that's perfect","ep063"
"32968",810,"I really like that it's near the two","ep063"
"32969",813,"parks and it's quiet and calm over here","ep063"
"32970",816,"it's a really nice neighborhood I think","ep063"
"32971",819,"I absolutely love the balcony and I love","ep063"
"32972",822,"the courtyard I enjoy the balcony so","ep063"
"32973",825,"much and I love the kitchen like I like","ep063"
"32974",828,"that there's so much light coming in but","ep063"
"32975",831,"it's not downtown and it's not that big","ep063"
"32976",834,"I think we could make the small room","ep063"
"32977",837,"work but budget we also have fun yeah","ep063"
"32978",840,"that's right Patrick thinks he has a way","ep063"
"32979",843,"to end the standoff it's very close to a","ep063"
"32980",846,"lot of green area and very close to the","ep063"
"32981",849,"city as well","ep063"
"32982",852,"yeah this is nice hmm that's gonna be a","ep063"
"32983",855,"challenge how do you like this peach","ep063"
"32984",858,"it's beautiful the waters fearful Kendra","ep063"
"32985",861,"and Mickle's six thousand mile long","ep063"
"32986",864,"distance relationship stood the test of","ep063"
"32987",867,"time it's not like in California with","ep063"
"32988",870,"waves but now they're ready to settle","ep063"
"32989",873,"down under the same roof and build a","ep063"
"32990",876,"life together in his native Denmark","ep063"
"32991",879,"Kendra is very dear to me obviously","ep063"
"32992",882,"that's the reason we dated even though","ep063"
"32993",885,"we live so far away from each other","ep063"
"32994",888,"wanna race nope I've been together with","ep063"
"32995",891,"Mikkel for about two and a half years","ep063"
"32996",894,"and I do think this is a big turning","ep063"
"32997",897,"point in our relationship little theory","ep063"
"32998",900,"this is our chance to see how our","ep063"
"32999",903,"relationship is going to develop and","ep063"
"33000",906,"grow we can put our feet in at the water","ep063"
"33001",909,"come on and what it's like to be","ep063"
"33002",912,"together more than just every two months","ep063"
"33003",915,"Nicole ISM Oh it'll be a brand new","ep063"
"33004",918,"dynamic for us and we're excited to see","ep063"
"33005",921,"what happens","ep063"
"33006",924,"yeah Kendra and I agree on a lot of","ep063"
"33007",927,"stuff but there's also obviously some","ep063"
"33008",930,"things where we have a different opinion","ep063"
"33009",933,"I really like this view and you feel a","ep063"
"33010",936,"little bit more out of the city being","ep063"
"33011",939,"here you are seven city we try to","ep063"
"33012",942,"communicate as much as possible be","ep063"
"33013",945,"plenty of room for me to do practice or","ep063"
"33014",948,"have some people over and teach them but","ep063"
"33015",951,"if we disagree or we don't see eye to","ep063"
"33016",954,"eye on something our communication can","ep063"
"33017",957,"sometimes get lost a little bit it's not","ep063"
"33018",960,"downtown and it's not that big I think","ep063"
"33019",963,"we could make the small room work but","ep063"
"33020",966,"budget we also have that yeah that's","ep063"
"33021",969,"right it seems like the biggest problem","ep063"
"33022",972,"is where they want to live","ep063"
"33023",975,"Eero rice patrick hopes a place that","ep063"
"33024",978,"blends affordability with a natural","ep063"
"33025",981,"backdrop for Kendra's yoga business will","ep063"
"33026",984,"finally seal the deal","ep063"
"33027",987,"so this next apartment is the Riverside","ep063"
"33028",990,"apartment I think is something that you","ep063"
"33029",993,"both gonna enjoy it's like three minutes","ep063"
"33030",996,"walk from downtown and it's actually","ep063"
"33031",999,"right behind a technical garden as well","ep063"
"33032",1002,"it's a tupid one bathroom so the","ep063"
"33033",1005,"location seems perfect but I'm a little","ep063"
"33034",1008,"concerned about the price well that's","ep063"
"33035",1011,"actually the good thing about it it's","ep063"
"33036",1014,"right on your budget","ep063"
"33037",1017,"that's something you can that sounds","ep063"
"33038",1020,"really good mm-hmm yeah okay guys come","ep063"
"33039",1023,"on in this is so nice and then we","ep063"
"33040",1026,"actually have the bathroom right here oh","ep063"
"33041",1029,"wow second bedroom is quite small yeah","ep063"
"33042",1032,"but let's wait and see what else we see","ep063"
"33043",1035,"I'm a little concerned with space I feel","ep063"
"33044",1038,"like we could be a little bit on top of","ep063"
"33045",1041,"each other here and I think it's","ep063"
"33046",1044,"important for us to both have room to","ep063"
"33047",1047,"breathe oh this is cute yeah it's cozy","ep063"
"33048",1050,"mm-hmm hmm there's not that much light","ep063"
"33049",1053,"coming in but we'll get the Morning Sun","ep063"
"33050",1056,"when it comes up here and then you'll","ep063"
"33051",1059,"get the afternoon in the latest on out","ep063"
"33052",1062,"on the river sighs with the darkness and","ep063"
"33053",1065,"the coldness in the winter that's gonna","ep063"
"33054",1068,"be a challenge yeah nice yeah the","ep063"
"33055",1071,"kitchen and living room combined hmm but","ep063"
"33056",1074,"I think it's pretty cozy this space I","ep063"
"33057",1077,"really do wish we had two separate","ep063"
"33058",1080,"spaces for hanging out and then doing","ep063"
"33059",1083,"yoga yeah","ep063"
"33060",1086,"[Music]","ep063"
"33061",1089,"mmm this is perfect this is nice and","ep063"
"33062",1092,"vacant yeah it's big it has a beautiful","ep063"
"33063",1095,"view look at that green space it's","ep063"
"33064",1098,"fantastic it's a cool hangout spot but I","ep063"
"33065",1101,"get the feeling that this apartment","ep063"
"33066",1104,"might not be as big as you guys has","ep063"
"33067",1107,"hoped yeah there isn't actually a","ep063"
"33068",1110,"separate space for yoga and the light","ep063"
"33069",1113,"it's not as open as we could have hoped","ep063"
"33070",1116,"for but I think the location is perfect","ep063"
"33071",1119,"I think the location is something you","ep063"
"33072",1122,"can't criticize it and I'm really happy","ep063"
"33073",1125,"that it's right on budget so I think it","ep063"
"33074",1128,"could still possibly work","ep063"
"33075",1131,"I think the downtown is a good fit for","ep063"
"33076",1134,"our lifestyle but being my nature would","ep063"
"33077",1137,"make me really happy","ep063"
"33078",1140,"mmm","ep063"
"33079",1143,"oh yeah it's nice yeah Kendra and Mikkel","ep063"
"33080",1146,"are ditching long distance and going","ep063"
"33081",1149,"full-time in his native Denmark I want","ep063"
"33082",1152,"our new apartment to look like this","ep063"
"33083",1155,"oh yeah but they're hitting a wall when","ep063"
"33084",1158,"it comes to where in Aarhus the next","ep063"
"33085",1161,"chapter of their relationship should","ep063"
"33086",1164,"start the probably needs to start","ep063"
"33087",1167,"talking about what we saw today yeah","ep063"
"33088",1170,"that's right Mikkel wants to be in the","ep063"
"33089",1173,"heart of the action but kandra's hoping","ep063"
"33090",1176,"to teach yoga and the atmosphere here in","ep063"
"33091",1179,"the city centre is anything but Zen","ep063"
"33092",1182,"there's a lot of people I mean that's","ep063"
"33093",1185,"what you get when you're downtown it was","ep063"
"33094",1188,"nicely located it was big and bright I","ep063"
"33095",1191,"really like that it's $1,200 per month","ep063"
"33096",1194,"under budget that's perfect","ep063"
"33097",1197,"but the balconies a little small and","ep063"
"33098",1200,"it's not surrounded by a lot of nature","ep063"
"33099",1203,"the natural setting of house 2 would be","ep063"
"33100",1206,"better for Kendra's business but there's","ep063"
"33101",1209,"a problem it's surrounded by trees and","ep063"
"33102",1212,"parks and that courtyard is amazing at","ep063"
"33103",1215,"$1,400 per month it was over budget and","ep063"
"33104",1218,"it was not that Vickie and I didn't","ep063"
"33105",1221,"really like the area feel a little bit","ep063"
"33106",1224,"more out of the city being here you are","ep063"
"33107",1227,"I would say yes","ep063"
"33108",1230,"I like that house threes location","ep063"
"33109",1233,"bridges the divide or so it seems","ep063"
"33110",1236,"I like the compromise it has a nice big","ep063"
"33111",1239,"balcony with green area yeah a river the","ep063"
"33112",1242,"grass that was so great it wasn't that","ep063"
"33113",1245,"bright though no and it wasn't that big","ep063"
"33114",1248,"no there isn't","ep063"
"33115",1251,"actually a separate space for yoga and","ep063"
"33116",1254,"the light that's not as openness with","ep063"

"33250",204,"charm I'm almost the complete opposite I","ep064"
"33251",207,"like the modern curb appeal simple is","ep064"
"33252",210,"better","ep064"
"33253",213,"moving ready I don't want to lift a","ep064"
"33254",216,"finger","ep064"
"33255",219,"a little open to just maybe like little","ep064"

"33258",228,"really tired of eating on the couch so I","ep064"
"33259",231,"need a dining room with chairs so if","ep064"
"33260",234,"that's not in the place then it's gonna","ep064"
"33261",237,"be a no-go she also wants an","ep064"
"33262",240,"open-concept kitchen Jamal this is so","ep064"
"33263",243,"frustrating","ep064"
"33264",246,"we don't need a big kitchen but we","ep064"
"33265",249,"definitely need more space than we have","ep064"
"33266",252,"now in the kitchen and sorry I love a","ep064"
"33267",255,"bigger bathroom","ep064"
"33268",258,"we're always on top of each other","ep064"
"33269",261,"Sabrina also wants a nice laundry room","ep064"
"33270",264,"but it might be a bigger need for Jamil","ep064"
"33271",267,"you know yeah I'm the one that does the","ep064"
"33272",270,"laundry in that so you know we don't","ep064"
"33273",273,"have a washer and dryer in the place so","ep064"
"33274",276,"he said that's fine I'll do the laundry","ep064"
"33275",279,"and so that says task now is to do the","ep064"
"33276",282,"laundry that's why they're focusing","ep064"
"33277",285,"their search on one of their favorite","ep064"
"33278",288,"neighborhoods near their current place","ep064"
"33279",291,"ready for some prenatal yoga stretching","ep064"
"33280",294,"we're looking in Montclair for a house","ep064"
"33281",297,"because it's really close to Manhattan","ep064"
"33282",300,"is a quick train ride away there's also","ep064"
"33283",303,"a lot of shops and restaurants and we","ep064"
"33284",306,"love to stay in a walkable area perfect","ep064"
"33285",309,"for our lifestyle right now really feel","ep064"
"33286",312,"that support from each other","ep064"
"33287",315,"I'm looking forward to space the most in","ep064"
"33288",318,"this next place I don't mind you know","ep064"
"33289",321,"first being so close I love you however","ep064"
"33290",324,"we do need you know to be able to","ep064"
"33291",327,"breathe that would be probably enough","ep064"
"33292",330,"for me so this is a decent neighborhood","ep064"
"33293",333,"first up a standalone house for Sabrina","ep064"
"33294",336,"that's walking distance to downtown I","ep064"
"33295",339,"think that this house is over a hundred","ep064"
"33296",342,"years old it looks that way not too fine","ep064"
"33297",345,"about the curb appeal but hopefully it's","ep064"
"33298",348,"nice inside hi everybody","ep064"
"33299",351,"how are you good so we have a","ep064"
"33300",354,"three-bedroom two-bath vintage cottage","ep064"
"33301",357,"about 1,300 square feet listed at 399","ep064"
"33302",360,"well that's that's at the top of our","ep064"
"33303",363,"price range so I know that but it needs","ep064"
"33304",366,"nothing that's kind of pushing it but it","ep064"
"33305",369,"is a standalone yeah I'll keep an open","ep064"
"33306",372,"mind I know that Sabrina really likes","ep064"
"33307",375,"the idea of a vintage home that has","ep064"
"33308",378,"character and I understand that Jamila","ep064"
"33309",381,"not so much however I wanted to give him","ep064"
"33310",384,"the idea of what it was like to live in","ep064"
"33311",387,"an old house especially a bright one","ep064"
"33312",390,"like this nice little sunroof yeah I","ep064"
"33313",393,"actually like this so somewhere we can","ep064"
"33314",396,"hang out and feel like you're outside","ep064"
"33315",399,"you can see our neighbors oh yeah so","ep064"
"33316",402,"here's my living room","ep064"
"33317",405,"wow it's a little tight I was looking","ep064"
"33318",408,"for the open concept and at this point I","ep064"
"33319",411,"don't know where the kitchen is so you","ep064"
"33320",414,"could take down this wall and that","ep064"
"33321",417,"sounds like your renovation so so let's","ep064"
"33322",420,"look at the kitchen it's very cute okay","ep064"
"33323",423,"the kitchen is updated it's definitely","ep064"
"33324",426,"more functional than the one we have now","ep064"
"33325",429,"all right we have to do the test can we","ep064"
"33326",432,"open a refrigerator and then a stove at","ep064"
"33327",435,"the same time the oven yeah and you know","ep064"
"33328",438,"when you're cooking you can always put","ep064"
"33329",441,"things on this counter yeah there's the","ep064"
"33330",444,"open-concept you needed that's this this","ep064"
"33331",447,"is it that's it not exactly what I was","ep064"
"33332",450,"looking for but it will do it's a","ep064"
"33333",453,"standalone house I've always dreamed of","ep064"
"33334",456,"having at least","ep064"
"33335",459,"dining room table and I don't think we","ep064"
"33336",462,"could fit that in here","ep064"
"33337",465,"it may be an issue they head downstairs","ep064"
"33338",468,"to check out the basement I can barely","ep064"
"33339",471,"get down","ep064"
"33340",474,"I didn't you remember limbo we are su","ep064"
"33341",477,"duck I feel like I'm like seven feet","ep064"

"33348",498,"share something with other people as","ep064"
"33349",501,"long as I don't hit my head on","ep064"
"33350",504,"everything down here so they head","ep064"
"33351",507,"upstairs to see the bedrooms the first","ep064"
"33352",510,"bedroom is the master oh it's a little","ep064"
"33353",513,"tiny what size bed is this ah this is a","ep064"
"33354",516,"queen it's a decent size but it's still","ep064"
"33355",519,"smaller than what we have fun let's look","ep064"
"33356",522,"at that room too","ep064"
"33357",525,"it would be perfect for a nursery yes I","ep064"
"33358",528,"would agree with it the third bedroom is","ep064"
"33359",531,"right next door okay","ep064"
"33360",534,"a little bigger we can knock this wall","ep064"
"33361",537,"out and make this our master bedroom and","ep064"
"33362",540,"make the other room the nurse absolutely","ep064"
"33363",543,"or we can not do any renovations and","ep064"
"33364",546,"it's the same way next they see the","ep064"
"33365",549,"upstairs bathroom actually yeah yeah I","ep064"
"33366",552,"like it yeah so do I I definitely like","ep064"
"33367",555,"the style of the house I would say it","ep064"
"33368",558,"definitely has character the character","ep064"
"33369",561,"doesn't give the home the functionality","ep064"
"33370",564,"that we want this house isn't really my","ep064"
"33371",567,"style that like more of the modern and","ep064"
"33372",570,"contemporary look I really like the yard","ep064"
"33373",573,"at least I can have somewhere where I","ep064"
"33374",576,"can garden it's a lot of work right and","ep064"
"33375",579,"we are already talking about doing more","ep064"
"33376",582,"renovations and it's at the top of our","ep064"
"33377",585,"budget so if it were move-in-ready and","ep064"
"33378",588,"we didn't have to do anything maybe I","ep064"
"33379",591,"maybe I think about I think that this","ep064"
"33380",594,"home might","ep064"
"33381",597,"provide for what we both want but he","ep064"
"33382",600,"just doesn't see it yet I'm I'm more so","ep064"
"33383",603,"interested in and maybe seeing a condo","ep064"

"33418",708,"no street noise we're not on a Main","ep064"
"33419",711,"Street so this is really good a big plus","ep064"
"33420",714,"is the terrace this provides exactly","ep064"
"33421",717,"what I was looking for in terms of just","ep064"
"33422",720,"some alone time in the outdoors","ep064"
"33423",723,"back inside they see the dining area I","ep064"
"33424",726,"think that our soon-to-be dining table","ep064"
"33425",729,"could be right here I'll sleep fit one","ep064"
"33426",732,"right yeah they passed through to see","ep064"
"33427",735,"the kitchen she's a little small at","ep064"
"33428",738,"least that's upgraded though can open up","ep064"
"33429",741,"the you're also looking out over this","ep064"
"33430",744,"open space right the kitchen is the same","ep064"
"33431",747,"size as the one we have now the","ep064"
"33432",750,"difference is we can open up the oven","ep064"
"33433",753,"and the refrigerator at the same time","ep064"
"33434",756,"which is not asking much but it's","ep064"
"33435",759,"definitely an upgrade for us","ep064"
"33436",762,"my coffee maker and then open the window","ep064"
"33437",765,"I'm sitting out exactly I love the","ep064"
"33438",768,"granite countertops and I love the color","ep064"
"33439",771,"I think it just all it kind of comes","ep064"
"33440",774,"together another big plus is the modern","ep064"
"33441",777,"finishes within the unit that was on my","ep064"
"33442",780,"wish list I'm really happy to see that","ep064"
"33443",783,"when I walk in so I'm seeing a lot of","ep064"
"33444",786,"storage in here and I am hoping I am","ep064"
"33445",789,"going to see a washer and dryer not in","ep064"
"33446",792,"that one so let me explain there is a","ep064"
"33447",795,"laundry room in the building but not in","ep064"
"33448",798,"the units okay you could do a pick up","ep064"
"33449",801,"and deliver we compromise somewhere I","ep064"
"33450",804,"really think you're gonna like the","ep064"
"33451",807,"master tall ceilings moldings are","ep064"
"33452",810,"beautiful okay a little bigger than our","ep064"
"33453",813,"place now oh yeah","ep064"
"33454",816,"they check out the second bedroom oh","ep064"
"33455",819,"this would be a good baby room in the","ep064"
"33456",822,"bathroom okay a little tight in here yes","ep064"
"33457",825,"this is really I think it's smaller","ep064"
"33458",828,"that's yes let's pretend that the","ep064"
"33459",831,"mirrors over there actually I'm doing my","ep064"
"33460",834,"makeup yeah no this is just maybe if you","ep064"
"33461",837,"just pushed this wall out I know there's","ep064"
"33462",840,"some storage on the other side and maybe","ep064"
"33463",843,"could just knock it out it's an option","ep064"
"33464",846,"absolutely not if we're gonna move","ep064"
"33465",849,"forward with this this is our bathroom","ep064"
"33466",852,"the condo also has a rooftop deck Wow","ep064"
"33467",855,"look at the view yes it is nice over","ep064"
"33468",858,"here this is 12 miles to New York City","ep064"
"33469",861,"this is not something you can get if you","ep064"
"33470",864,"were living in a little house someplace","ep064"
"33471",867,"I guess I could see myself out here in","ep064"
"33472",870,"the mornings definitely yoga up here","ep064"
"33473",873,"[Music]","ep064"
"33474",876,"so what do you guys think about this","ep064"
"33475",879,"unit we love the price","ep064"
"33476",882,"you love 3:30 we love the natural light","ep064"
"33477",885,"and we also love the layout yeah and the","ep064"
"33478",888,"location and the location it's walkable","ep064"
"33479",891,"the shops are right at our fingertips","ep064"
"33480",894,"but there is no washer and dryer there's","ep064"
"33481",897,"no watch'n Drive the bathroom's really","ep064"
"33482",900,"tight this is a hard sell for us","ep064"
"33483",903,"so their agent Roberta has lined up a","ep064"
"33484",906,"bigger place but it's more Sabrina style","ep064"
"33485",909,"than jamel's I love the cape cod-style","ep064"
"33486",912,"yeah I mean not my preferred but we'll","ep064"
"33487",915,"see","ep064"
"33488",918,"[Music]","ep064"
"33489",921,"expectant parents Sabrina and Jamil are","ep064"
"33490",924,"looking to put down roots and Montclair","ep064"
"33491",927,"New Jersey with a budget of $400,000","ep064"
"33492",930,"they've seen a 100 year old home that's","ep064"
"33493",933,"Sabrina light but it needed some work","ep064"
"33494",936,"then they saw a condo that Jamila","ep064"
"33495",939,"preferred but they both felt that it","ep064"
"33496",942,"might be a little small for their","ep064"
"33497",945,"growing family today they're a mile","ep064"
"33498",948,"outside their target area in Bloomfield","ep064"
"33499",951,"to see another single-family home this","ep064"
"33500",954,"is a three-bedroom one-bath Cape Cod","ep064"
"33501",957,"priced at 349 that's a really good price","ep064"
"33502",960,"it is and I love the Cape cod-style yeah","ep064"
"33503",963,"I mean not my preferred choice but the","ep064"
"33504",966,"price is good so I could be I could be","ep064"
"33505",969,"convinced I think that Jamila and","ep064"
"33506",972,"Sabrina would really enjoy this house","ep064"
"33507",975,"once her baby came because there's a","ep064"
"33508",978,"little more space it has some options","ep064"
"33509",981,"for growth oh this is nice Wow little","ep064"
"33510",984,"fireplace is level this is really nice","ep064"
"33511",987,"okay I guess it does have a little charm","ep064"
"33512",990,"yeah there is a sunroom right here too","ep064"
"33513",993,"which is very very bright okay and then","ep064"
"33514",996,"we can even use it in the wintertime as","ep064"
"33515",999,"well especially with a little run","ep064"
"33516",1002,"running running around yeah yeah we can","ep064"
"33517",1005,"definitely fit like a nice table in here","ep064"
"33518",1008,"and the best thing is that it opens up","ep064"
"33519",1011,"to the kitchen area so it gives us a lot","ep064"
"33520",1014,"of space to not be so closed off from","ep064"
"33521",1017,"our guests if they're here yeah I really","ep064"
"33522",1020,"like the way it flows yeah and I like","ep064"
"33523",1023,"that the kitchen is updated ready yeah","ep064"
"33524",1026,"one two three","ep064"
"33525",1029,"off the kitchen is a deck so not only do","ep064"
"33526",1032,"you have a yard you have a deck yeah we","ep064"
"33527",1035,"can add an addition may put some stairs","ep064"
"33528",1038,"down here and just open up to the rest","ep064"
"33529",1041,"of the yard space it's a really big","ep064"
"33530",1044,"space I would normally fight that but","ep064"
"33531",1047,"you know the price points really good so","ep064"
"33532",1050,"we may be able to have some wiggle room","ep064"
"33533",1053,"wait so are you saying you're actually","ep064"
"33534",1056,"open to some renovations the right","ep064"
"33535",1059,"situation may be I think this house","ep064"
"33536",1062,"doesn't need much convincing for Jamila","ep064"
"33537",1065,"I think he can see himself in this home","ep064"
"33538",1068,"a little bit","ep064"
"33539",1071,"[Music]","ep064"
"33540",1074,"yeah we can both fit in here I like the","ep064"
"33541",1077,"finishes they really took a job with Deb","ep064"
"33542",1080,"Nate's in here they see a bedroom","ep064"
"33543",1083,"downstairs and head to the second floor","ep064"
"33544",1086,"with us to consider the master bedroom","ep064"
"33545",1089,"you can make it into the master we can","ep064"
"33546",1092,"even have us a little nook right there","ep064"
"33547",1095,"there's some in there say it's great","ep064"
"33548",1098,"space","ep064"
"33549",1101,"okay and then there's a little law I can","ep064"
"33550",1104,"hide in here across the hall is a","ep064"
"33551",1107,"possible nursery Wow yeah it's actually","ep064"
"33552",1110,"really perfect for a nursery Oliver yeah","ep064"
"33553",1113,"yeah I love this house it has that","ep064"
"33554",1116,"little Cape Cod feel to it put a few","ep064"
"33555",1119,"pillows over there is perfect they check","ep064"
"33556",1122,"out the unfinished basement a lot of","ep064"
"33557",1125,"space down here for sure it just needs","ep064"
"33558",1128,"some work","ep064"
"33559",1131,"sure yeah is that a toilet over there","ep064"
"33560",1134,"yes you could make a full bathroom here","ep064"
"33561",1137,"if you wished there is a laundry hook up","ep064"
"33562",1140,"down here as well okay okay so there's a","ep064"
"33563",1143,"hook up at least so is this a","ep064"
"33564",1146,"consideration yeah definitely I think","ep064"
"33565",1149,"this is definitely in a running it's not","ep064"
"33566",1152,"really a fixer-upper I really like the","ep064"
"33567",1155,"open kitchen concept the move-in","ep064"
"33568",1158,"readiness of this place is a huge plus","ep064"
"33569",1161,"for me I'm not really happy about the","ep064"
"33570",1164,"the yard where I put the new baby coming","ep064"
"33571",1167,"along that's not something that I would","ep064"
"33572",1170,"really want to take off it has three","ep064"
"33573",1173,"bedrooms not too fond of the curb appeal","ep064"
"33574",1176,"it's just wasn't my style but at this","ep064"
"33575",1179,"price point is a really attractive only","ep064"
"33576",1182,"a mile away from the Montclair area I","ep064"
"33577",1185,"mean I guess that's not too bad","ep064"
"33578",1188,"since none of the options meet all their","ep064"
"33579",1191,"needs they'll have to decide between","ep064"
"33580",1194,"price walkability and in-unit laundry so","ep064"
"33581",1197,"what are we designing","ep064"
"33582",1200,"soon-to-be parents Sabrina and Jamil are","ep064"
"33583",1203,"looking to find the perfect first home","ep064"
"33584",1206,"for their baby with a budget of $400,000","ep064"
"33585",1209,"they've seen several single-family homes","ep064"
"33586",1212,"and condos in and around Montclair New","ep064"
"33587",1215,"Jersey now it's time to decide so the","ep064"
"33588",1218,"first one that we need to talk about is","ep064"
"33589",1221,"the vintage home for 399 I love the fact","ep064"
"33590",1224,"that it's a standalone home but if the","ep064"
"33591",1227,"bedrooms are really really tiny yeah and","ep064"
"33592",1230,"I could barely walk down the basement","ep064"
"33593",1233,"without hitting my head and I'm not even","ep064"
"33594",1236,"that tall but it did have the full-sized","ep064"
"33595",1239,"washer and dryer at the top of our","ep064"
"33596",1242,"budget at 399 and we have the remedy","ep064"
"33597",1245,"okay let's take a look at the next house","ep064"
"33598",1248,"the condo for 3:30 the price point was","ep064"
"33599",1251,"nice I really like the flow of the condo","ep064"
"33600",1254,"it's finished","ep064"
"33601",1257,"there was no maintenance I think you're","ep064"
"33602",1260,"really trying to sell me on this home","ep064"
"33603",1263,"because you know it's a condo I have to","ep064"
"33604",1266,"admit the location is perfect it's","ep064"
"33605",1269,"literally downtown and the big plus was","ep064"
"33606",1272,"that there was a terrorist no washer and","ep064"
"33607",1275,"dryer I don't like communal laundry","ep064"
"33608",1278,"spaces but I do all the laundry let's","ep064"
"33609",1281,"look at the Cape Cod for 349 another","ep064"
"33610",1284,"standalone house Joey","ep064"
"33611",1287,"surprisingly I actually liked this place","ep064"
"33612",1290,"he didn't like the yard and the deck but","ep064"
"33613",1293,"I actually like the inside of that place","ep064"
"33614",1296,"it was practically done it had three","ep064"
"33615",1299,"bedrooms and there was the washer and","ep064"
"33616",1302,"dryer hookup but it's really not in our","ep064"
"33617",1305,"desired location yeah it definitely","ep064"
"33618",1308,"would have to drive to downtown to the","ep064"
"33619",1311,"restaurants and the shops so that's","ep064"
"33620",1314,"something to think about","ep064"
"33621",1317,"so what are we deciding","ep064"
"33622",1320,"[Music]","ep064"
"33623",1323,"the more than I think about it I have to","ep064"
"33624",1326,"agree with you a little bit on the condo","ep064"
"33625",1329,"there is really no renovations to be","ep064"
"33626",1332,"done it's not a fixer-upper I think we","ep064"
"33627",1335,"can work with it that would give us an","ep064"
"33628",1338,"opportunity to just focus on the baby so","ep064"
"33629",1341,"I think we should go with the condo I","ep064"
"33630",1344,"agree we should definitely talk to","ep064"
"33631",1347,"Roberta before you change your mind yeah","ep064"
"33632",1350,"[Music]","ep064"
"33633",1353,"absolutely so we chose the condo the","ep064"
"33634",1356,"house was listed at 3:30 we actually","ep064"
"33635",1359,"paid 335 for it because there were","ep064"
"33636",1362,"multiple offers right but they still got","ep064"
"33637",1365,"it for way under their original $400,000","ep064"
"33638",1368,"budget another reason why we chose this","ep064"
"33639",1371,"place because it was important for us to","ep064"
"33640",1374,"be somewhere that's active now one block","ep064"
"33641",1377,"away from the downtown area we could","ep064"
"33642",1380,"literally grab a stroller and head","ep064"
"33643",1383,"downtown this is what exactly what I was","ep064"
"33644",1386,"asking for I think we made the best","ep064"
"33645",1389,"financial decision in terms of","ep064"
"33646",1392,"maintaining our lifestyle I'm really","ep064"
"33647",1395,"excited for the for our baby to come I'm","ep064"
"33648",1398,"excited for more adventures more travel","ep064"
"33649",1401,"I keep traveling that's the pain what's","ep064"
"33650",1404,"the baby in you with the baby coming we","ep064"
"33651",1407,"really wanted to just be able to focus","ep064"
"33652",1410,"on our child rather than the maintenance","ep064"
"33653",1413,"of the house all right","ep064"
"33654",1416,"last year's chair finally got your","ep064"
"33655",1419,"dining room table yes bingo but they do","ep064"

"33930",771,"types of flooring","ep065"

"33945",816,"that's a change","ep065"
"33946",819,"yeah they check out the family room and","ep065"

"34384",651,"their broker has shown them a high-rise","ep066"
"34385",654,"with a view for mark that was vintage","ep066"
"34386",657,"inside for Ally but the kitchen was","ep066"
"34387",660,"short on storage and Mark wants a more","ep066"
"34388",663,"modern interior so now their broker has","ep066"
"34389",666,"lined up a renovated walk-up in Lincoln","ep066"
"34390",669,"Park it's one of the most desirable","ep066"
"34391",672,"neighborhoods in Chicago this she is he","ep066"

"34402",705,"gonna get any leak views but it's a","ep066"
"34403",708,"15-minute walk from it okay","ep066"
"34404",711,"this units a great compromise for them","ep066"
"34405",714,"because even though it has the vintage","ep066"
"34406",717,"look that she was looking for inside its","ep066"
"34407",720,"remodeled and it doesn't feel like","ep066"
"34408",723,"vintage it's nice it's kind of a room I","ep066"
"34409",726,"like the crown molding adds a lot of","ep066"
"34410",729,"nice character to it that's a perfect","ep066"
"34411",732,"Christmas tree window right there","ep066"
"34412",735,"dele don't knock in the corner I'd say","ep066"

"34414",741,"that's true","ep066"
"34415",744,"it's not exactly a great view I know","ep066"
"34416",747,"Ally doesn't mind looking at some trees","ep066"
"34417",750,"for our view but I like to look at water","ep066"

"34423",768,"this microwave oh no yeah but since it's","ep066"
"34424",771,"over budget","ep066"

"34597",1290,"most to do it's not turnkey but it's got","ep066"
"34598",1293,"great Christmas tree windows it has a","ep066"
"34599",1296,"vintage charm on the outside especially","ep066"
"34600",1299,"and inside I think it looks really","ep066"
"34601",1302,"pretty","ep066"
"34602",1305,"there's no views it's not much to look","ep066"
"34603",1308,"at let's go to the modern Wow how about","ep066"

"34612",1335,"entertaining it's open to the living","ep066"
"34613",1338,"room there were a lot of cabinets there","ep066"
"34614",1341,"was hidden trash that was a really nice","ep066"
"34615",1344,"kitchen and I think that third bedroom","ep066"
"34616",1347,"would be perfect for the cat all right","ep066"

"34643",1428,"to convince mark to take on a couple of","ep066"
"34644",1431,"projects before we moved in because I","ep066"
"34645",1434,"thought it would be easier when there","ep066"
"34646",1437,"was no furniture in the place so we've","ep066"
"34647",1440,"been able to install floors in the","ep066"
"34648",1443,"bedrooms and the backsplash in the","ep066"
"34649",1446,"kitchen it makes a big difference I like","ep066"
"34650",1449,"it","ep066"
"34651",1452,"the trash can is really tiny but I was","ep066"

"34661",1482,"family are here to see the new home and","ep066"

"34692",48,"with closet small but functional only","ep067"
"34693",51,"looks a little like an airplane bathroom","ep067"
"34694",54,"and as far as getting a usable outdoor","ep067"
"34695",57,"space close to downtown dirt the glass","ep067"
"34696",60,"dispenses terrible on the verge of being","ep067"
"34697",63,"a deal breaker","ep067"
"34698",66,"[Music]","ep067"
"34699",69,"[Applause]","ep067"

"34708",96,"conveniently was flying as a passenger","ep067"
"34709",99,"in my exit row and after talking the","ep067"
"34710",102,"entire flight he said hey let's grab","ep067"

"34717",123,"what better place for two flight","ep067"
"34718",126,"attendants to get married than a museum","ep067"
"34719",129,"full of airplanes yeah I think we'll","ep067"
"34720",132,"disagree on the comfort Philadelphia is","ep067"
"34721",135,"a great city because it's got the hustle","ep067"
"34722",138,"and bustle but still kind of that small","ep067"
"34723",141,"city charm it is really a melting pot of","ep067"
"34724",144,"different cultures and activities but","ep067"
"34725",147,"you know you still run into people that","ep067"
"34726",150,"you know on the street so it's kind of","ep067"
"34727",153,"the best of both worlds history the food","ep067"
"34728",156,"it's an amazing city they just need to","ep067"
"34729",159,"get out of their rental and into a home","ep067"
"34730",162,"of their own currently we live in","ep067"
"34731",165,"Rittenhouse Square which is a great","ep067"
"34732",168,"neighborhood that has lots of","ep067"
"34733",171,"restaurants shopping so I think we","ep067"
"34734",174,"focused our search on downtown South","ep067"
"34735",177,"Philly we wanted to have pretty easy","ep067"
"34736",180,"access to the city I'd rather have a","ep067"
"34737",183,"brick home I agree like that would be","ep067"
"34738",186,"nice the style house that I'm looking","ep067"
"34739",189,"for is loft feel open floor plan exposed","ep067"
"34740",192,"brick exposed duct working very","ep067"
"34741",195,"modern-looking rich on the other hand","ep067"
"34742",198,"prefers the classic style of a cape","ep067"
"34743",201,"cause I grew up in Boston so that New","ep067"
"34744",204,"England charm is something that I really","ep067"
"34745",207,"am looking for in a house so I'm","ep067"
"34746",210,"definitely looking more first a house","ep067"
"34747",213,"that I can call home since I grew up in","ep067"
"34748",216,"an apartment","ep067"
"34749",219,"but given the location of central Philly","ep067"
"34750",222,"where they'd like to stay they know a","ep067"
"34751",225,"row house may be a more realistic option","ep067"
"34752",228,"a churchman row house would be nice","ep067"
"34753",231,"something with little details and","ep067"
"34754",234,"architecture something you know where we","ep067"
"34755",237,"can just walk into the main level maybe","ep067"
"34756",240,"a couple of steps with Andrew and I both","ep067"
"34757",243,"traveling for work you know we're always","ep067"
"34758",246,"taught suitcases and luggage","ep067"
"34759",249,"carrying things in and out of the house","ep067"
"34760",252,"second bedroom is an absolute must we","ep067"
"34761",255,"are looking for two bedrooms two","ep067"
"34762",258,"bathrooms the second bath is","ep067"
"34763",261,"super-important to me our only bathroom","ep067"
"34764",264,"in our apartment is in our bedroom which","ep067"
"34765",267,"is upstairs so the entire house has to","ep067"
"34766",270,"stay clean for people to use the","ep067"
"34767",273,"bathroom","ep067"
"34768",276,"so having guests over is not something","ep067"
"34769",279,"we do on the regular because I don't","ep067"
"34770",282,"want to clean the whole house before it","ep067"
"34771",285,"I really hope that Regina can find","ep067"
"34772",288,"something fast in our price range that","ep067"
"34773",291,"works we have a budget of about two","ep067"
"34774",294,"hundred and fifty thousand we're hoping","ep067"
"34775",297,"to come in a little bit lower than we","ep067"
"34776",300,"can always customize the other stuff","ep067"
"34777",303,"later","ep067"
"34778",306,"the most important thing for me is that","ep067"
"34779",309,"it's move-in ready and doesn't require a","ep067"
"34780",312,"lot of work I am NOT the most handy","ep067"
"34781",315,"person in the world so I want something","ep067"
"34782",318,"that I can just bring my furniture into","ep067"
"34783",321,"and call it home I also would really","ep067"
"34784",324,"like to have some sort of outdoor space","ep067"
"34785",327,"I don't really want to ardor any outdoor","ep067"
"34786",330,"space to take care of I would prefer","ep067"
"34787",333,"that it be a deck off of a second-story","ep067"
"34788",336,"somewhere you know how important the","ep067"
"34789",339,"kitchen is to me too I'd also really","ep067"
"34790",342,"like a big open kitchen I love when","ep067"
"34791",345,"kitchens are open into the main living","ep067"
"34792",348,"area I really want gas appliances those","ep067"
"34793",351,"are really important to me and if we","ep067"
"34794",354,"could have some sort of fireplace would","ep067"
"34795",357,"really enjoy that also high on their","ep067"
"34796",360,"list is a finished basement some usable","ep067"
"34797",363,"living space in the basement would be","ep067"
"34798",366,"nice I also really would enjoy some sort","ep067"
"34799",369,"of laundry space I just hope we find","ep067"
"34800",372,"something without any carpet I think","ep067"
"34801",375,"it's grass I live in a house with","ep067"
"34802",378,"someone else's carpet definitely","ep067"
"34803",381,"hardwood floors would be something that","ep067"
"34804",384,"I would like to have I don't like","ep067"
"34805",387,"putting my feet down on cold floors in","ep067"
"34806",390,"the morning so carpet in the bedrooms","ep067"
"34807",393,"would be great hey guys how's it going","ep067"
"34808",396,"hey fantastic it's really important for","ep067"
"34809",399,"us to have a home especially with our","ep067"
"34810",402,"jobs so having a place that's really our","ep067"
"34811",405,"own that we can come home to at the end","ep067"
"34812",408,"of a long week of being apart I think is","ep067"
"34813",411,"really important for both of us","ep067"
"34814",414,"this is the house right here to the left","ep067"
"34815",417,"first up a traditional row house the","ep067"
"34816",420,"area is a couple blocks away from","ep067"
"34817",423,"University City so your little bit","ep067"
"34818",426,"outside Philadelphia Adelia they would","ep067"
"34819",429,"like to be where they currently live in","ep067"
"34820",432,"Rittenhouse Square however they know","ep067"
"34821",435,"that that's not in their budget so we're","ep067"
"34822",438,"still trying to figure out exactly what","ep067"
"34823",441,"neighborhood is the right choice for","ep067"
"34824",444,"them oh nice I love that porch","ep067"
"34825",447,"oh look it even has a garage it's three","ep067"
"34826",450,"bedrooms two and a half baths and just","ep067"
"34827",453,"over 1,300 square feet and it is listed","ep067"
"34828",456,"it at a hundred and ninety five thousand","ep067"
"34829",459,"very good yeah well I did like the curb","ep067"
"34830",462,"appeal in this house I was worried that","ep067"
"34831",465,"there are a lot of steps with Andrew and","ep067"
"34832",468,"I both carrying suitcases for work I","ep067"
"34833",471,"think that could be an issue oh wow","ep067"
"34834",474,"Magina","ep067"
"34835",477,"this is amazing I'm stunned by these","ep067"
"34836",480,"floors these floors are amazing he's","ep067"
"34837",483,"exposed brick and the metal railings on","ep067"
"34838",486,"the stairwell really add a very modern","ep067"
"34839",489,"touch which is what I was looking for","ep067"
"34840",492,"yeah I like how they kept some of the","ep067"
"34841",495,"traditional elements with the brick and","ep067"
"34842",498,"the wood it's great I really love the","ep067"
"34843",501,"gas fireplace that's a really nice touch","ep067"
"34844",504,"but the textured table behind it it's","ep067"
"34845",507,"really beautiful I feel like there's so","ep067"
"34846",510,"much space in this room we're gonna have","ep067"
"34847",513,"to go shopping for more furniture no no","ep067"
"34848",516,"no you're shopping okay don't over here","ep067"

"34850",522,"nice right here on the first floor","ep067"
"34851",525,"that's great definitely small but","ep067"
"34852",528,"functional or he's just fine only looks","ep067"
"34853",531,"a little like an airplane bathroom I","ep067"
"34854",534,"never here we have our dining room area","ep067"
"34855",537,"pitifully interesting here a lot more","ep067"
"34856",540,"than we do in our current small city","ep067"
"34857",543,"apartment absolutely yeah I really like","ep067"
"34858",546,"these windows over here too this isn't","ep067"
"34859",549,"something you see a whole lot in a row","ep067"
"34860",552,"house yeah nice and bright in here this","ep067"
"34861",555,"backsplash over here is beautiful these","ep067"
"34862",558,"cabinets are really nice I have to be","ep067"
"34863",561,"honest I really dislike every piece of","ep067"
"34864",564,"it it's dark on dark on dark I do wish","ep067"
"34865",567,"they picked a different countertops","ep067"
"34866",570,"something lighter to brighten it up and","ep067"
"34867",573,"here would have been nice it's got the","ep067"
"34868",576,"gas appliances which you know oh yeah","ep067"

"34870",582,"turkey yes please they walk through the","ep067"
"34871",585,"laundry room and head out to see the","ep067"
"34872",588,"yard","ep067"

"34875",597,"we're not gonna have to mow this yeah I","ep067"
"34876",600,"feel like the only thing missing is an","ep067"
"34877",603,"umbrella drink to finish off this Tiki","ep067"
"34878",606,"vibe yeah that fence would have to go I","ep067"
"34879",609,"think we could use a little more privacy","ep067"
"34880",612,"than that I don't particularly want any","ep067"
"34881",615,"outdoor space I think with rich and I","ep067"
"34882",618,"traveling so much that it's just","ep067"
"34883",621,"something else that we have to take care","ep067"
"34884",624,"of back inside they head downstairs to","ep067"
"34885",627,"see the basement all right there's not a","ep067"
"34886",630,"lot going on down here it's not really","ep067"
"34887",633,"livable space but at least there's","ep067"
"34888",636,"plenty of storage and you do have access","ep067"
"34889",639,"to your garage over there","ep067"
"34890",642,"oh that would be nice yeah they head","ep067"

"34899",669,"off the master bedroom for sure but I'm","ep067"
"34900",672,"not sure about some of the finishes in","ep067"
"34901",675,"here or that corner shower is a Star","ep067"

"34906",690,"natural light in here I think this is a","ep067"

"34908",696,"honestly you know there's two closets I","ep067"
"34909",699,"think we could do like a his in his","ep067"
"34910",702,"closet situation which would be nice","ep067"
"34911",705,"honestly I think this is the best room","ep067"
"34912",708,"on this floor I really liked the open","ep067"
"34913",711,"floor plan and you know I was","ep067"
"34914",714,"immediately drawn to the exposed brick","ep067"
"34915",717,"and the railings going up the stairs","ep067"
"34916",720,"although I am a little bit worried about","ep067"
"34917",723,"how many stairs just coming alone into","ep067"
"34918",726,"the house with all of our suitcases and","ep067"
"34919",729,"things like that","ep067"
"34920",732,"I am concerned with the neighborhood","ep067"
"34921",735,"it's a little further out than we want","ep067"
"34922",738,"it to be you know I definitely think the","ep067"
"34923",741,"neighborhood is a big factor with this","ep067"
"34924",744,"one I honestly love the placement of the","ep067"
"34925",747,"washer and dryer too so nice to have it","ep067"
"34926",750,"on the first floor I did like that that","ep067"
"34927",753,"backyard area was finished there was","ep067"
"34928",756,"that deck no real maintenance back there","ep067"
"34929",759,"which would be really nice so now","ep067"

"34945",807,"is hoping for a cape cod-style with lots","ep067"
"34946",810,"of charm and outdoor space while Andrew","ep067"

"34948",816,"with a finished basement so far they've","ep067"
"34949",819,"seen an updated row house with a nice","ep067"
"34950",822,"outdoor space and a laundry room","ep067"
"34951",825,"but it was outside their target","ep067"
"34952",828,"neighborhood and didn't have a useable","ep067"
"34953",831,"basement now their agents showing them a","ep067"
"34954",834,"cape cod-style house for rich I know you","ep067"

"34959",849,"the city it's only 30 minutes from the","ep067"
"34960",852,"city were in Northeast Philly","ep067"
"34961",855,"it's not that far I know I said I wanted","ep067"

"34967",873,"is listed at $250,000 I mean that's at","ep067"
"34968",876,"the top of our budget it better be","ep067"
"34969",879,"beautiful inside growing up in New","ep067"
"34970",882,"England I was drawn more into the Cape","ep067"
"34971",885,"Cod style homes but the location in this","ep067"
"34972",888,"house really doesn't work for me it's","ep067"
"34973",891,"too far outside of the city and it's way","ep067"
"34974",894,"too far from work okay I do like how","ep067"
"34975",897,"open an area it is in here this kind of","ep067"
"34976",900,"creates a nice layout for entertaining","ep067"
"34977",903,"if we had guests honestly the openness","ep067"
"34978",906,"is the only thing I really liked in this","ep067"
"34979",909,"room these laminate floors look cheap","ep067"
"34980",912,"yeah these laminate floors would","ep067"
"34981",915,"definitely have to go let's check out","ep067"
"34982",918,"the kitchen don't you guys think of this","ep067"
"34983",921,"I really like the layout of this kitchen","ep067"
"34984",924,"you know I think the island here is nice","ep067"
"34985",927,"does that gas house with appliances yeah","ep067"
"34986",930,"it looks like this is a nice big gas","ep067"
"34987",933,"stove for you good I love the backsplash","ep067"
"34988",936,"in the granite the cabinets are a little","ep067"
"34989",939,"dated maybe a little farmhouse to me I","ep067"
"34990",942,"definitely think this has a little bit","ep067"
"34991",945,"of a grand mouth feel that I'm not crazy","ep067"
"34992",948,"about you also have your dining room","ep067"
"34993",951,"space over here to the right okay it's","ep067"
"34994",954,"pretty small in here though I'm not even","ep067"
"34995",957,"sure you can fit a dining table in here","ep067"
"34996",960,"plus we have to go buy one anyway this","ep067"
"34997",963,"is just a wasted space to me the only","ep067"
"34998",966,"thing that I like about this room is","ep067"
"34999",969,"that light fixture I really wish it","ep067"
"35000",972,"would have been put somewhere else in","ep067"
"35001",975,"the house that is a cool light fixture","ep067"
"35002",978,"you know let's check out the master","ep067"
"35003",981,"bedroom","ep067"
"35004",984,"closet space here all right that works","ep067"
"35005",987,"all right","ep067"
"35006",990,"good size and then this is the master","ep067"
"35007",993,"bedroom this master bedroom is right off","ep067"
"35008",996,"of the dining room that doesn't make any","ep067"
"35009",999,"sense but it is a good-sized space so","ep067"
"35010",1002,"there is that plus they passed through","ep067"
"35011",1005,"the laundry room I really like that the","ep067"
"35012",1008,"laundry was on the first floor that was","ep067"
"35013",1011,"a really good placement especially with","ep067"
"35014",1014,"all the bags that rich and I have to","ep067"
"35015",1017,"carry for work so this is your master","ep067"
"35016",1020,"bathroom shared bathroom space this","ep067"
"35017",1023,"seems like a really weird layout I'm not","ep067"
"35018",1026,"sure about this at all it's cramped and","ep067"
"35019",1029,"I can't believe this is the only","ep067"
"35020",1032,"bathroom on the first floor yeah so this","ep067"
"35021",1035,"bathroom is gonna be shared with your","ep067"
"35022",1038,"guests and your master bedroom I mean I","ep067"
"35023",1041,"guess I like the finishes in here this","ep067"
"35024",1044,"tile is really beautiful weird that","ep067"
"35025",1047,"there's no medicine cabinet and like so","ep067"
"35026",1050,"little storage in this room and the lack","ep067"
"35027",1053,"of tub is very confusing to me to","ep067"
"35028",1056,"attempt would have been a lot nicer for","ep067"
"35029",1059,"this master bathroom if you can call it","ep067"
"35030",1062,"that right they look at a bedroom before","ep067"
"35031",1065,"heading upstairs to see another bedroom","ep067"
"35032",1068,"when you said bedroom did you get","ep067"
"35033",1071,"confused with closet Stillings are a","ep067"
"35034",1074,"little bit low can be used as a bedroom","ep067"
"35035",1077,"space where it makes sense check out the","ep067"
"35036",1080,"next bedroom over here to your right","ep067"
"35037",1083,"wait Regina I think we're gonna have to","ep067"
"35038",1086,"talk about your definition of a bedroom","ep067"
"35039",1089,"because this is not it I mean I think","ep067"
"35040",1092,"you could fit a bed in here but that's","ep067"
"35041",1095,"literally the only thing that would fit","ep067"
"35042",1098,"in here and here we go with the","ep067"
"35043",1101,"carpeting I don't like this at all I","ep067"
"35044",1104,"actually really like the carpet slope","ep067"
"35045",1107,"I'll it'll be easy to clean I don't","ep067"
"35046",1110,"think it was a bad choice no I just know","ep067"
"35047",1113,"I don't like it just no no that's it","ep067"
"35048",1116,"they look at a full bath before seeing","ep067"
"35049",1119,"the last bedroom now this is what I'd","ep067"
"35050",1122,"call a bedroom yeah this size is","ep067"
"35051",1125,"definitely something we could work with","ep067"
"35052",1128,"and check out the storage space behind","ep067"
"35053",1131,"these closet doors oh nice oh wow okay","ep067"
"35054",1134,"there's a lot of storage space in here","ep067"
"35055",1137,"although I'm not sure we could hang any","ep067"
"35056",1140,"clothing in here with the sloped","ep067"
"35057",1143,"ceilings no does it go all the way","ep067"
"35058",1146,"through or is it separated yes it goes","ep067"
"35059",1149,"all the way through oh good","ep067"
"35060",1152,"[Music]","ep067"
"35061",1155,"when we first walked up I was","ep067"
"35062",1158,"immediately worried about how much","ep067"
"35063",1161,"outdoor space we had because we didn't","ep067"
"35064",1164,"want a yard this big or at all and the","ep067"
"35065",1167,"drive out here from the city was really","ep067"
"35066",1170,"far it did have a little bit of curb","ep067"
"35067",1173,"appeal which was nice","ep067"
"35068",1176,"everything in here seems pretty modern","ep067"
"35069",1179,"and updated for the most part which is","ep067"
"35070",1182,"nice there was stuffing something we","ep067"
"35071",1185,"were looking for it so now they're","ep067"
"35072",1188,"finally seeing a place in their target","ep067"
"35073",1191,"neighborhood but what's this giant hole","ep067"
"35074",1194,"whose responsibilities at","ep067"
"35075",1197,"[Music]","ep067"
"35076",1200,"maybe I'll get beginner's luck you don't","ep067"
"35077",1203,"know Andrew and rich are looking for","ep067"
"35078",1206,"their first house with a two hundred and","ep067"
"35079",1209,"fifty thousand dollar budget in","ep067"
"35080",1212,"Philadelphia they've seen an updated row","ep067"
"35081",1215,"house with modern features a nice","ep067"
"35082",1218,"outdoor space at a laundry room but it","ep067"
"35083",1221,"wasn't in their target location then","ep067"
"35084",1224,"they saw a cape cod that was 30 minutes","ep067"
"35085",1227,"from the city and the yard was much","ep067"
"35086",1230,"larger than they wanted but it had a","ep067"
"35087",1233,"first-floor laundry room and minimal","ep067"
"35088",1236,"stairs","ep067"
"35089",1239,"now they're seeing another row house","ep067"
"35090",1242,"this time right in central Philly so","ep067"
"35091",1245,"this is the house right up here oh nice","ep067"
"35092",1248,"classic Philly real home I like that","ep067"
"35093",1251,"what's this giant hole whose","ep067"
"35094",1254,"responsibility is that this is probably","ep067"
"35095",1257,"the city's responsibility so nothing you","ep067"
"35096",1260,"guys will have to worry about okay so","ep067"
"35097",1263,"this is recently rehabbed two bedrooms","ep067"
"35098",1266,"one and a half baths and is listed at","ep067"
"35099",1269,"200,000 well under budget within our","ep067"
"35100",1272,"budget that's great the row home is nice","ep067"
"35101",1275,"it sits right on the street which is","ep067"
"35102",1278,"easy for getting bags in so I really","ep067"
"35103",1281,"enjoyed that aspect have a nice moderate","ep067"
"35104",1284,"open layout it does we wanted that","ep067"
"35105",1287,"beautiful floors I love the big","ep067"

"35108",1296,"maybe some more detail to keep the charm","ep067"
"35109",1299,"of the home behind you do you think it","ep067"
"35110",1302,"was covering up a fireplace do you think","ep067"
"35111",1305,"we can find yeah it might have been this","ep067"
"35112",1308,"homes built in 1925 so there could have","ep067"
"35113",1311,"been a possible fireplace right there","ep067"
"35114",1314,"true we can check into that I'm just not","ep067"
"35115",1317,"sure if all of our furnitures gonna fit","ep067"
"35116",1320,"in here as is I was just wondering the","ep067"
"35117",1323,"same thing but I think it's really small","ep067"
"35118",1326,"and we're gonna be tied to furniture","ep067"
"35119",1329,"placement we're not gonna have room for","ep067"
"35120",1332,"a dining room table or he's feeding on a","ep067"
"35121",1335,"counter for dinner","ep067"

"35143",1401,"something with low-maintenance that we","ep067"
"35144",1404,"didn't have to worry about I mean this","ep067"
"35145",1407,"is just awful dirt the glass this fence","ep067"
"35146",1410,"is terrible stucco is awful it's on the","ep067"
"35147",1413,"verge of being a deal breaker they head","ep067"

"35149",1419,"oh this basement is not finished at all","ep067"
"35150",1422,"I'm not even sure we could use this","ep067"
"35151",1425,"space for how low the ceiling is too","ep067"
"35152",1428,"there is a washer and dryer hookup but","ep067"
"35153",1431,"with as dirty as it is down here I'm not","ep067"

"35165",1467,"first bedroom before seeing the master","ep067"
"35166",1470,"this is great size I think our furniture","ep067"
"35167",1473,"should fit fine in here yeah I really","ep067"
"35168",1476,"like the size the two windows are really","ep067"
"35169",1479,"great they have the nice baseboards","ep067"
"35170",1482,"carpet I'm not a huge fan of the carpet","ep067"
"35171",1485,"but as long as it's not in the main","ep067"
"35172",1488,"floor I guess we can compromise on that","ep067"
"35173",1491,"storage space over here mm-hmm","ep067"

"35180",1512,"love about Philadelphia","ep067"
"35181",1515,"the backyard the class all the mess that","ep067"
"35182",1518,"was out there yeah I was hoping for an","ep067"
"35183",1521,"outdoor space that was a little more","ep067"
"35184",1524,"finished I'm definitely concerned about","ep067"
"35185",1527,"the basement too we were really hoping","ep067"
"35186",1530,"for a nice finished laundry area that","ep067"
"35187",1533,"was ready to go after seeing several","ep067"
"35188",1536,"options it's time for them to decide the","ep067"
"35189",1539,"choice may come down to whether the","ep067"
"35190",1542,"house is close to their target location","ep067"
"35191",1545,"has a laundry room or has a backyard","ep067"
"35192",1548,"that appeals to them we should probably","ep067"
"35193",1551,"make a decision on one of these houses","ep067"
"35194",1554,"before we lose them","ep067"
"35195",1557,"[Music]","ep067"
"35196",1560,"andrew and rich are looking for a home","ep067"
"35197",1563,"in philadelphia within their 250","ep067"
"35198",1566,"thousand dollar budget they've seen","ep067"
"35199",1569,"several options and now it's time to","ep067"
"35200",1572,"decide I really liked that gray row I'm","ep067"
"35201",1575,"listening 195,000 it definitely combined","ep067"
"35202",1578,"the traditional elements of rural home","ep067"
"35203",1581,"with the modern elements as well that's","ep067"
"35204",1584,"the one that had the washer and dryer in","ep067"
"35205",1587,"the back of the house on the first floor","ep067"
"35206",1590,"which would be great I also really liked","ep067"
"35207",1593,"that this house had outdoor space it did","ep067"
"35208",1596,"have a nice new finished deck and there","ep067"
"35209",1599,"wouldn't be a lot to take care of there","ep067"
"35210",1602,"I didn't really care for the","ep067"
"35211",1605,"neighborhood plus it's not even anywhere","ep067"
"35212",1608,"near the restaurants and shopping and","ep067"
"35213",1611,"all the usual places we like to hang out","ep067"
"35214",1614,"in Philadelphia let's talk about the","ep067"
"35215",1617,"Cape Cod the house is listed at 250,000","ep067"
"35216",1620,"which is top of our budget I think it's","ep067"
"35217",1623,"really far outside of the city there was","ep067"
"35218",1626,"a huge yard with so much maintenance","ep067"
"35219",1629,"that kitchen I did love that layout that","ep067"
"35220",1632,"Island was great for gathering and","ep067"
"35221",1635,"having people around Plus remember that","ep067"
"35222",1638,"had the washer and dryer in the first","ep067"
"35223",1641,"floor which would be great when we carry","ep067"
"35224",1644,"in our bags okay the red brick row home","ep067"
"35225",1647,"that's listed at two hundred thousand","ep067"
"35226",1650,"like that home that kitchen was","ep067"
"35227",1653,"beautiful I didn't like that backyard at","ep067"
"35228",1656,"all and the amount of time that we're","ep067"
"35229",1659,"gonna have to spend out there cleaning","ep067"
"35230",1662,"it up what about that basement that","ep067"
"35231",1665,"basement was rough plus the washer and","ep067"
"35232",1668,"dryer setup was there but we'd still","ep067"
"35233",1671,"have to buy the appliances I do love the","ep067"
"35234",1674,"upstairs the room size was great the","ep067"
"35235",1677,"bathroom upstairs was really nice and I","ep067"
"35236",1680,"really like the location of that row","ep067"
"35237",1683,"house with the proximity to downtown","ep067"
"35238",1686,"yeah that definitely drew me to this","ep067"
"35239",1689,"house too","ep067"
"35240",1692,"I personally I'm leaning more towards","ep067"
"35241",1695,"the red brick row house it's the perfect","ep067"
"35242",1698,"size we can really just move right in","ep067"
"35243",1701,"plus I think that that neighborhood is a","ep067"
"35244",1704,"little more accessible for both of us","ep067"
"35245",1707,"and closer to all the restaurants and","ep067"
"35246",1710,"shopping so then it's settled we're","ep067"
"35247",1713,"going with the red brick row house I","ep067"
"35248",1716,"think that's a great idea","ep067"
"35249",1719,"we definitely should we put in an offer","ep067"
"35250",1722,"on the house about five months ago we","ep067"
"35251",1725,"closed about a month ago and we just","ep067"
"35252",1728,"moved in last week all right","ep067"
"35253",1731,"looks good the asking price was two and","ep067"
"35254",1734,"a thousand and we ended up paying two","ep067"
"35255",1737,"hundred and ten but this right over here","ep067"
"35256",1740,"we'd primarily picked this house because","ep067"
"35257",1743,"of the location to the city for only","ep067"
"35258",1746,"about a mile from Rittenhouse Square","ep067"
"35259",1749,"which was our preferred neighborhood it","ep067"
"35260",1752,"was just that perfect sweet spot for us","ep067"
"35261",1755,"so you're leaving tomorrow right yeah","ep067"
"35262",1758,"I've got a trip tomorrow morning it one","ep067"
"35263",1761,"compromise I feel like I made with this","ep067"
"35264",1764,"house is that we didn't really have much","ep067"
"35265",1767,"of a yard space at all right now it's","ep067"
"35266",1770,"just a small patch of dirt so when we're","ep067"
"35267",1773,"thinking about putting up a patio you","ep067"
"35268",1776,"can enjoy the outdoor space in the","ep067"
"35269",1779,"summer the mall out just in case I don't","ep067"
"35270",1782,"know how hungry they are some of the","ep067"
"35271",1785,"major compromises that I made in this","ep067"
"35272",1788,"house was the lack of usable basement","ep067"
"35273",1791,"space with the low ceilings there's no","ep067"
"35274",1794,"way that we can turn into anything other","ep067"
"35275",1797,"than storage or laundry facilities that","ep067"
"35276",1800,"looks good I think my favorite room in","ep067"
"35277",1803,"the house is actually the kitchen it's","ep067"
"35278",1806,"just a great space for us we have the","ep067"
"35279",1809,"barstools that we can sit at and chat","ep067"
"35280",1812,"and make dinner and we really enjoyed","ep067"
"35281",1815,"sharing that space together having only","ep067"
"35282",1818,"one staircase has been amazing being","ep067"
"35283",1821,"able to roll the bag into the front door","ep067"
"35284",1824,"and right up the stairs has been a dream","ep067"
"35285",1827,"I'm excited to know that since we're","ep067"
"35286",1830,"getting married in a few months that we","ep067"
"35287",1833,"get to come home to a completely","ep067"
"35288",1836,"furnished house and not have to worry","ep067"
"35289",1839,"about this process in a year or so it's","ep067"

"35301",36,"wants it's got a lot of character and","ep068"
"35302",39,"bringing it back to the era would be","ep068"
"35303",42,"awesome okay but her friend Laura thinks","ep068"

"35414",375,"it it could be really cute yeah but look","ep068"

"35421",396,"260 thousand way below the budget and","ep068"
"35422",399,"definitely would be a really good","ep068"
"35423",402,"investment I could do anything I wanted","ep068"
"35424",405,"with it maybe expand yeah you're gonna","ep068"
"35425",408,"have to sell me on this one for sure","ep068"

"35434",435,"know it's to the era of the home and I","ep068"
"35435",438,"love 1940 little bungalows this would be","ep068"
"35436",441,"what I would get in this home and then","ep068"
"35437",444,"it's got you know this adorable built-in","ep068"
"35438",447,"right here I can totally picture like","ep068"
"35439",450,"all my vintage bar wares in here I don't","ep068"
"35440",453,"see the space working for you at all I","ep068"
"35441",456,"think it's gonna be too small maybe I","ep068"
"35442",459,"use this space as the dining room","ep068"
"35443",462,"instead yeah it might work oh I love the","ep068"
"35444",465,"archway this is cute this kitchen is","ep068"
"35445",468,"ridiculous haha","ep068"
"35446",471,"Sarah loves to entertain and cook she is","ep068"
"35447",474,"not going to be able to cook in that","ep068"
"35448",477,"kitchen it's gonna make her nuts it's","ep068"
"35449",480,"got a lot of character and bringing it","ep068"
"35450",483,"back to the area would be awesome","ep068"
"35451",486,"okay here's one of the bedrooms and LA","ep068"
"35452",489,"I'm not sure if this would be the master","ep068"
"35453",492,"if there's hopefully maybe a little bit","ep068"
"35454",495,"of a bigger option for the master but it","ep068"
"35455",498,"gets good light it seems pretty small to","ep068"
"35456",501,"me well here is the one and only","ep068"
"35457",504,"bathroom Oh yikes","ep068"
"35458",507,"this is really bad actually I agree with","ep068"
"35459",510,"you it's it's pretty bad so this","ep068"
"35460",513,"obviously a total gut job definitely on","ep068"
"35461",516,"the smaller side I think this actually","ep068"
"35462",519,"might be a little bit smaller than the","ep068"
"35463",522,"back bedroom oh I mean this is a really","ep068"
"35464",525,"big backyard there's plenty of room to","ep068"
"35465",528,"still have a outdoor space for meatloaf","ep068"
"35466",531,"and my pool and our pool in just be your","ep068"
"35467",534,"pool although you can pay for the pool","ep068"
"35468",537,"let me throw it in and the lot is","ep068"
"35469",540,"definitely big enough that if I wanted","ep068"
"35470",543,"to out on a big master suite it could be","ep068"
"35471",546,"really awesome it's nice","ep068"
"35472",549,"I like the blue door oh I mean this","ep068"
"35473",552,"space is much nicer than I was actually","ep068"
"35474",555,"thinking it was gonna be from the","ep068"
"35475",558,"outside you know the boys they would","ep068"
"35476",561,"fight over the space cuz I feel like","ep068"
"35477",564,"having your own apartment you know on","ep068"
"35478",567,"the property","ep068"
"35479",570,"I absolutely love the age and that it","ep068"
"35480",573,"hasn't really been touched so I could","ep068"
"35481",576,"actually make it my own","ep068"
"35482",579,"it needs a lot of work Sarah I don't","ep068"
"35483",582,"know can you fit all this in in the time","ep068"

"35556",801,"the overalls","ep068"
"35557",804,"this is definitely big enough where I","ep068"
"35558",807,"can have a big table I can have you know","ep068"
"35559",810,"a bunch of friends over they pass","ep068"
"35560",813,"through the family room on their way to","ep068"

"35562",819,"space back here to add a pool","ep068"
"35563",822,"I'm maybe you could have a small little","ep068"
"35564",825,"you know wading pool it's hot and Chico","ep068"
"35565",828,"in the summertime we're looking at a","ep068"
"35566",831,"hundred and eight degrees and no pool so","ep068"
"35567",834,"you know that's a little bit of a","ep068"
"35568",837,"downside for this house and here I guess","ep068"
"35569",840,"is the guest best fight and bright I do","ep068"
"35570",843,"like the skylight and then the vanity is","ep068"
"35571",846,"got to go if I was to get this house","ep068"
"35572",849,"it's definitely more modern and you know","ep068"
"35573",852,"doesn't look 60s same with you know","ep068"
"35574",855,"pretty much all of the fixtures inside","ep068"
"35575",858,"of here down the hall they see two","ep068"
"35576",861,"bedrooms for the boys been head to the","ep068"
"35577",864,"master master I'm used to a much bigger","ep068"
"35578",867,"bedroom than that's a king-size bed I","ep068"
"35579",870,"don't see a king-size bed fitting in","ep068"
"35580",873,"here I don't see you know an area for","ep068"
"35581",876,"dressers I'm not sure about this size if","ep068"
"35582",879,"it's doable Wow okay we obviously have","ep068"
"35583",882,"the same vanity that was in the guest","ep068"
"35584",885,"bath it's gotten the same light as well","ep068"
"35585",888,"so basically those would need to get","ep068"
"35586",891,"changed out right now she needs to get","ep068"
"35587",894,"moved into a home and I think this","ep068"
"35588",897,"bathrooms beautiful and will work for","ep068"
"35589",900,"now and maybe she just needs to back off","ep068"
"35590",903,"the vintage a little bit and just take","ep068"
"35591",906,"that bathroom as it is","ep068"
"35592",909,"I love the hardwood floors and that","ep068"
"35593",912,"they're original they're absolutely","ep068"
"35594",915,"beautiful it's right across from the","ep068"
"35595",918,"park it's right next to you it is moving","ep068"
"35596",921,"ready and Ike which means I could close","ep068"
"35597",924,"escrow faster and just you know move in","ep068"
"35598",927,"but then also that leads into my","ep068"
"35599",930,"negative which is you know it is flipped","ep068"
"35600",933,"it is you know to somebody else's taste","ep068"
"35601",936,"and and everything's nice but you know","ep068"
"35602",939,"it's just it's not me","ep068"
"35603",942,"like I definitely need to have that","ep068"
"35604",945,"vintage Flair to my home and I much","ep068"
"35605",948,"rather have it be something that's","ep068"
"35606",951,"unique so now she's found another","ep068"
"35607",954,"mid-century home that she hopes will","ep068"
"35608",957,"have more vintage character it's still","ep068"
"35609",960,"in 1962 so era wise it's perfect it","ep068"
"35610",963,"could be perfect yeah","ep068"
"35611",966,"[Music]","ep068"
"35612",969,"oh this one I kind of I was thinking","ep068"
"35613",972,"maybe for work it's really beautiful","ep068"
"35614",975,"silk forties I love it","ep068"
"35615",978,"Sarah loves all things vintage so she's","ep068"
"35616",981,"looking for a house in Chico California","ep068"
"35617",984,"that reflects her tastes I love a good","ep068"
"35618",987,"time yeah the time I do working with a","ep068"
"35619",990,"$600,000 budget she and her friend Laura","ep068"
"35620",993,"have seen a 1940's bungalow that had","ep068"
"35621",996,"plenty of vintage features but it also","ep068"
"35622",999,"needed a lot of work then they saw a","ep068"
"35623",1002,"1960s ranch that was recently updated","ep068"
"35624",1005,"but some of the vintage character had","ep068"
"35625",1008,"been removed so now she's found another","ep068"
"35626",1011,"option in an area known as The Avenues I","ep068"
"35627",1014,"do like this neighborhood being in the","ep068"
"35628",1017,"ABS yeah I want you closer to me I know","ep068"
"35629",1020,"and you know it is the ranch and built","ep068"
"35630",1023,"in 1962 so era wise it's perfect","ep068"
"35631",1026,"it could be perfect yeah what's the","ep068"
"35632",1029,"price on it four hundred and ten","ep068"
"35633",1032,"thousand way under budget no I could do","ep068"
"35634",1035,"whatever I want and best thing has a","ep068"
"35635",1038,"pool will be awesome when you come right","ep068"
"35636",1041,"into the dining room which I'm a little","ep068"
"35637",1044,"concerned about this space it looks a","ep068"
"35638",1047,"little small to me what are you saying I","ep068"
"35639",1050,"don't know I don't think your tables","ep068"
"35640",1053,"gonna fit in the space I don't think it","ep068"
"35641",1056,"will either and I love to have lots of","ep068"
"35642",1059,"people over you know cook and have","ep068"
"35643",1062,"everybody sitting down at the table","ep068"
"35644",1065,"which is really nice but I do like that","ep068"
"35645",1068,"it opens up into the living room and the","ep068"
"35646",1071,"living room you know it's got I like the","ep068"
"35647",1074,"the brick wall with the fireplace","ep068"
"35648",1077,"definitely would have to redo the floors","ep068"
"35649",1080,"I am NOT a fan of carpet as you know","ep068"
"35650",1083,"size-wise I'm not quite sure if this is","ep068"
"35651",1086,"big enough I definitely like to have","ep068"
"35652",1089,"space where we can all hang out","ep068"
"35653",1092,"oh that's kitchens tight","ep068"
"35654",1095,"this is a little tight looks like","ep068"
"35655",1098,"potentially remodeled in the 90s","ep068"
"35656",1101,"not my favorite mm-hmm this definitely","ep068"
"35657",1104,"would need pretty much a total overhaul","ep068"
"35658",1107,"maybe I look into taking out this wall","ep068"
"35659",1110,"then this entire space could actually be","ep068"
"35660",1113,"pretty awesome","ep068"
"35661",1116,"so sir's on a tight schedule we need to","ep068"
"35662",1119,"find her something and get","ep068"
"35663",1122,"removed I think her doing a Renault it's","ep068"
"35664",1125,"just not really a good idea right now","ep068"
"35665",1128,"huh hmm well this is interesting it's","ep068"
"35666",1131,"I'm not sure if this is the master or is","ep068"
"35667",1134,"this just like an extra just sweet I do","ep068"
"35668",1137,"love how big the space is I definitely","ep068"
"35669",1140,"think the boys would probably fight over","ep068"
"35670",1143,"who got to take this as their room may","ep068"
"35671",1146,"see a full bathroom attached to this","ep068"
"35672",1149,"bedroom then go across the house to see","ep068"
"35673",1152,"another full bathroom two more bedrooms","ep068"
"35674",1155,"and the actual master actually a really","ep068"
"35675",1158,"good size mm-hmm","ep068"
"35676",1161,"I like this master so bright in here","ep068"
"35677",1164,"looks like another 90s remodel I would","ep068"
"35678",1167,"say the wood shower walls I know that I","ep068"
"35679",1170,"like being a a new one","ep068"
"35680",1173,"what I haven't seen before but then","ep068"
"35681",1176,"again you can still move into this and","ep068"
"35682",1179,"make it your own over time I think this","ep068"
"35683",1182,"bathroom I would have to actually do you","ep068"
"35684",1185,"really think I can handle that it's a","ep068"
"35685",1188,"little crazy let's go take a look at the","ep068"
"35686",1191,"pool and hopefully we just hang out at","ep068"
"35687",1194,"the pool the time anyways I do like the","ep068"
"35688",1197,"French doors beautiful yeah it's a pool","ep068"
"35689",1200,"it's a pool all right it is pretty much","ep068"
"35690",1203,"only a pool there's not really any","ep068"
"35691",1206,"grassy area for meatloaf to run around I","ep068"
"35692",1209,"like it I know you like it I know the","ep068"
"35693",1212,"boys will like it I do love this master","ep068"
"35694",1215,"I think the size on the light it's","ep068"
"35695",1218,"really pretty and right out to the pool","ep068"
"35696",1221,"so this area is awesome yeah the pool","ep068"
"35697",1224,"definitely is another positive I also I","ep068"
"35698",1227,"like the price on this one obviously","ep068"
"35699",1230,"under budget on negative side though you","ep068"
"35700",1233,"know there's a lot of projects that","ep068"
"35701",1236,"kitchen needs to be redone but for now","ep068"
"35702",1239,"it still has move-in ready you can move","ep068"
"35703",1242,"in and then just do those over time you","ep068"
"35704",1245,"know I don't want to do the money","ep068"
"35705",1248,"I'm kind of excited about you know","ep068"
"35706",1251,"getting to make the house exactly the","ep068"
"35707",1254,"way I want it I'm gonna really have to","ep068"
"35708",1257,"think about this one since she can't","ep068"
"35709",1260,"have everything she wants and she has","ep068"
"35710",1263,"limited time it may come down to how","ep068"
"35711",1266,"badly she wants vintage charm versus how","ep068"
"35712",1269,"much work she's really willing to do","ep068"
"35713",1272,"[Music]","ep068"
"35714",1275,"again","ep068"
"35715",1278,"sarah has a $600,000 budget for a house","ep068"
"35716",1281,"in Chico California it's big enough for","ep068"
"35717",1284,"herself and her two grown sons she and","ep068"
"35718",1287,"her friend Laura have seen several","ep068"
"35719",1290,"possibilities now she's ready to choose","ep068"
"35720",1293,"what about that 1940s bungalow near","ep068"
"35721",1296,"downtown for 260 thousand you do have","ep068"
"35722",1299,"room in the backyard for a pool it could","ep068"
"35723",1302,"be such a fun restoration project I can","ep068"
"35724",1305,"add on a huge master you know I could","ep068"
"35725",1308,"totally redo that kitchen","ep068"
"35726",1311,"it could be six seven months down the","ep068"
"35727",1314,"road before you ever get it to where you","ep068"
"35728",1317,"it's livable for you the 1960s Ranch","ep068"
"35729",1320,"right by the park","ep068"
"35730",1323,"this place is priced at $499,000","ep068"
"35731",1326,"obviously that location is amazing right","ep068"
"35732",1329,"by you","ep068"
"35733",1332,"the yard is also beautiful super shaded","ep068"
"35734",1335,"yeah but there's no room for a pool in","ep068"
"35735",1338,"the backyard and then I would have to","ep068"
"35736",1341,"tear out brand-new fixtures and things","ep068"
"35737",1344,"that somebody just put in to make it be","ep068"
"35738",1347,"what I would want it to be but still","ep068"
"35739",1350,"it's move-in ready what do you think","ep068"
"35740",1353,"about the 1962 ranch in the avenues","ep068"
"35741",1356,"priced at 410 obviously it has your pool","ep068"
"35742",1359,"so you know that's one benefit to that","ep068"
"35743",1362,"house I do love all of the extra square","ep068"
"35744",1365,"footage as well as that master I think","ep068"
"35745",1368,"it was the best master we saw but the","ep068"
"35746",1371,"kitchen needs to be redone all the","ep068"
"35747",1374,"bathrooms need to be redone and at 410","ep068"
"35748",1377,"there","ep068"
"35749",1380,"so many options with that house so which","ep068"
"35750",1383,"one will she choose","ep068"
"35751",1386,"I love the 1960s ranch right by the park","ep068"
"35752",1389,"its location I mean that's like the best","ep068"
"35753",1392,"location pretty much in all of Chico and","ep068"
"35754",1395,"it's more move-in ready than the other","ep068"
"35755",1398,"places we looked at and you know I can","ep068"
"35756",1401,"add all of my little touches throughout","ep068"
"35757",1404,"so make it more my own I need to like go","ep068"
"35758",1407,"put in an offer ASAP let's do it right","ep068"
"35759",1410,"now let's do it","ep068"
"35760",1413,"go for a walk in the park I've been","ep068"
"35761",1416,"living in the house now for about three","ep068"
"35762",1419,"weeks this location is absolutely","ep068"
"35763",1422,"amazing you know I get home from work","ep068"
"35764",1425,"and take meat lifts off for a walk","ep068"
"35765",1428,"and then obviously there's always being","ep068"
"35766",1431,"able to walk to my girlfriend Lala's","ep068"

"35882",237,"town so finding a rental for someone is","ep069"
"35883",240,"kind of a tall order especially if they","ep069"
"35884",243,"have a wish list a mile long ideally I","ep069"
"35885",246,"would love to have three bedrooms and","ep069"
"35886",249,"the rental property also I would love to","ep069"
"35887",252,"be in town so that walking distance to","ep069"
"35888",255,"the cafes and shops and just making the","ep069"
"35889",258,"most of beach life so preferably with a","ep069"
"35890",261,"lotion view","ep069"
"35891",264,"something with a bit of character would","ep069"
"35892",267,"be good I know Nate's wish list is a","ep069"
"35893",270,"little bit different to mine so I think","ep069"
"35894",273,"ideally I'd like to find somewhere rural","ep069"
"35895",276,"maybe 15 minutes out of town a little","ep069"
"35896",279,"bit of peace and quiet would be great","ep069"
"35897",282,"okay if we're gonna make the move from","ep069"
"35898",285,"the city I like to perhaps be somewhere","ep069"
"35899",288,"rural or most definitely in the bush a","ep069"
"35900",291,"sea view would be amazing but some of","ep069"
"35901",294,"the quiet peaceful how much are you guys","ep069"
"35902",297,"looking to spend thousand dollars alone","ep069"
"35903",300,"okay we might have to go a little bit","ep069"
"35904",303,"over the rentals that are available are","ep069"
"35905",306,"quite expensive because there's just not","ep069"
"35906",309,"a lot out there I would prefer to keep","ep069"
"35907",312,"it under budget that is close to town","ep069"
"35908",315,"and in the bush yes I've never quite had","ep069"
"35909",318,"anybody come in and want totally","ep069"
"35910",321,"opposite things before there's got to be","ep069"
"35911",324,"a happy medium but I certainly can't","ep069"
"35912",327,"think of one right now so Juliet goes to","ep069"
"35913",330,"the top of Nate's wish list house one is","ep069"
"35914",333,"a remote cottage in the bush 20 minutes","ep069"
"35915",336,"from town isn't it gorgeous about years","ep069"
"35916",339,"in fact woods everywhere this is in the","ep069"
"35917",342,"bush just like Nate wanted you have all","ep069"
"35918",345,"the privacy you could ever want this as","ep069"
"35919",348,"I really is this is a modern cottage","ep069"
"35920",351,"comes fully furnished it's completely","ep069"
"35921",354,"off grid your electricity independent","ep069"
"35922",357,"with solar panels will like that no","ep069"
"35923",360,"bills no bills and about 20 minutes from","ep069"
"35924",363,"town but the beauty of it is it's only","ep069"
"35925",366,"900 a month that is really good","ep069"
"35926",369,"oh well cozy fairly compact but I love","ep069"
"35927",372,"the furniture it's cute it's really cute","ep069"
"35928",375,"is it a living room this is kind of your","ep069"
"35929",378,"living and bedroom combo this is it well","ep069"
"35930",381,"you do have a nice kitchen over here all","ep069"
"35931",384,"the way over there what do you think","ep069"
"35932",387,"Nate I think it's perfect we don't need","ep069"
"35933",390,"much more room than this okay that's why","ep069"
"35934",393,"it's 900 a month when we decided to move","ep069"
"35935",396,"to the Coromandel this is exactly what I","ep069"
"35936",399,"had in mind somewhere secluded away from","ep069"
"35937",402,"people I think this is enough for us","ep069"
"35938",405,"this is ideal it'll be cozy but we still","ep069"
"35939",408,"have the issue of being out in the","ep069"
"35940",411,"middle of nowhere but we'll address this","ep069"
"35941",414,"if I can live remotely like this I","ep069"
"35942",417,"really don't know let's have a look at","ep069"
"35943",420,"the kitchen","ep069"
"35944",423,"okay oh wow","ep069"
"35945",426,"just view nice view of the bush out the","ep069"
"35946",429,"window while you're cooking yeah you","ep069"
"35947",432,"have a gas hob a nice new fridge who","ep069"
"35948",435,"hopes tiny fridge perfect for adult oh","ep069"
"35949",438,"the kitchen is tiny it really was quite","ep069"
"35950",441,"overwhelming how small that was I was","ep069"
"35951",444,"looking for something quite a bit bigger","ep069"
"35952",447,"than that we'd only struggle if we had","ep069"
"35953",450,"guests but most of the time it will just","ep069"
"35954",453,"be us great let's have a look at the","ep069"
"35955",456,"restroom okay excellent it's nice and","ep069"
"35956",459,"light but there's no bath it is very","ep069"
"35957",462,"modern but unfortunately there's not","ep069"
"35958",465,"room for a bath should shower though so","ep069"
"35959",468,"that's a bonus what do you think I think","ep069"
"35960",471,"it's still I do I don't see anything","ep069"
"35961",474,"wrong so that there's plenty of space in","ep069"
"35962",477,"here you prefer your shower but I'm just","ep069"
"35963",480,"a bit disappointed there's no bath I","ep069"
"35964",483,"love the place the size of the house may","ep069"
"35965",486,"be a little small but to me it's all","ep069"
"35966",489,"about the outside I'm not exactly sure","ep069"
"35967",492,"cares as sold on the idea of living out","ep069"
"35968",495,"this far away from town I think she's","ep069"
"35969",498,"already got her mind set on what she's","ep069"
"35970",501,"exactly looking for right guys this is","ep069"
"35971",504,"one of the best features of the property","ep069"
"35972",507,"you have your own private stream the","ep069"
"35973",510,"water is so clean you could drink it","ep069"
"35974",513,"doesn't expect to find this at the","ep069"
"35975",516,"bottom of the garden I'm really excited","ep069"
"35976",519,"it's amazing beautiful what did you guys","ep069"
"35977",522,"think of the house","ep069"
"35978",525,"it's exactly what I want somewhere right","ep069"
"35979",528,"out of civilisation self-maintained","ep069"
"35980",531,"quiet cozy but that's all we need I","ep069"
"35981",534,"really like it no bells is a major bonus","ep069"
"35982",537,"the location still an issue for me but","ep069"
"35983",540,"we'll see definitely worth considering","ep069"
"35984",543,"obviously this is a dream for me perfect","ep069"
"35985",546,"location gorgeous apartment the","ep069"
"35986",549,"apartment block idea I'm not so sure","ep069"
"35987",552,"about to find everything they want is","ep069"
"35988",555,"going to be virtually impossible oh gosh","ep069"
"35989",558,"as cold excited it to be warmer than","ep069"
"35990",561,"Scott","ep069"
"35991",564,"after one brief introduction and five","ep069"
"35992",567,"months getting to know each other by","ep069"
"35993",570,"phone I managed to finally convince it","ep069"
"35994",573,"to move to be with me has left home and","ep069"
"35995",576,"family in Scotland for Auckland New","ep069"
"35996",579,"Zealand making the journey itself was","ep069"
"35997",582,"just nerve-wracking but was so worth it","ep069"
"35998",585,"because we just have been desperate to","ep069"
"35999",588,"see each other for so many months it's","ep069"
"36000",591,"so quiet I can see the fish jumping this","ep069"
"36001",594,"is perfect they soon decided to hunt for","ep069"
"36002",597,"a new home in the Coromandel Peninsula","ep069"
"36003",600,"near the town of vidi anga away from","ep069"
"36004",603,"city life and just concentrate on each","ep069"
"36005",606,"other rather than having this whole","ep069"
"36006",609,"whirlwind of a massive city floating","ep069"
"36007",612,"around us as well this new idea but","ep069"
"36008",615,"while they both want a quiet life near","ep069"
"36009",618,"the Coromandel is calm sunny coast there","ep069"
"36010",621,"is a risk I've been working in the same","ep069"
"36011",624,"industry now for about 15 years giving","ep069"
"36012",627,"all that up and moving to a town where","ep069"
"36013",630,"there is no job there is a huge risk and","ep069"
"36014",633,"real confusion about the home they hope","ep069"
"36015",636,"to find I know Nate's wish list is a","ep069"
"36016",639,"little bit different to mine well the","ep069"
"36017",642,"wish list Nate wants to be out of town","ep069"
"36018",645,"in a little batch off the grid kad's","ep069"
"36019",648,"wants to be in town in a modern new","ep069"
"36020",651,"place where she can walk everywhere so","ep069"
"36021",654,"we've got completely different needs","ep069"
"36022",657,"house one is certainly rural this sure","ep069"
"36023",660,"doesn't expect to find us at the bottom","ep069"
"36024",663,"of the garden give your own private","ep069"
"36025",666,"stream I'm it excited it's amazing","ep069"
"36026",669,"beautiful and it's priced below budget","ep069"
"36027",672,"it's only 900 a month that is really","ep069"
"36028",675,"good but while its remote location is at","ep069"
"36029",678,"the top of Nate's wish list I like to","ep069"
"36030",681,"perhaps be somewhere in the bush to","ep069"
"36031",684,"Hobbs tiny fridge perfect for a doll so","ep069"
"36032",687,"it's far away from the lifestyle caz","ep069"
"36033",690,"once the further we go into the jungle","ep069"
"36034",693,"the more I was thinking absolutely no","ep069"
"36035",696,"way whatsoever I love the place the size","ep069"
"36036",699,"of the house may be a little small but","ep069"
"36037",702,"to me it's all about the outside in the","ep069"
"36038",705,"river look at those gorgeous houses with","ep069"
"36039",708,"the beautiful view this is absolutely","ep069"
"36040",711,"idyllic I really would love to be in","ep069"
"36041",714,"town that would be excellent to be","ep069"
"36042",717,"around some life being able to walk to","ep069"
"36043",720,"the shops and the cafes and restaurants","ep069"
"36044",723,"Juliette brings the hand out of the bush","ep069"
"36045",726,"to an apartment close to town but how","ep069"
"36046",729,"- lacks the rural character Nate wants","ep069"
"36047",732,"my strategy for picking this house was I","ep069"
"36048",735,"wanted something a bit different than","ep069"
"36049",738,"the country house I wanted to show them","ep069"
"36050",741,"something that was a bit more roomy and","ep069"
"36051",744,"to have good views of the water it's a","ep069"
"36052",747,"3-bedroom 2bath apartment then you're","ep069"
"36053",750,"extremely close to the water this was","ep069"
"36054",753,"beautiful being right across the road","ep069"
"36055",756,"from the beach how much is this it's","ep069"
"36056",759,"1,100 a month it's a little over budget","ep069"
"36057",762,"and it does remind me being back in the","ep069"
"36058",765,"city again as well so yeah I'm not","ep069"
"36059",768,"really so sure really yeah but let's","ep069"
"36060",771,"have a look inside this is amazing looks","ep069"
"36061",774,"like time to compromise okay","ep069"
"36062",777,"you have a really nice big living room","ep069"
"36063",780,"area a huge deck that overlooks the","ep069"
"36064",783,"water that's absolutely beautiful the","ep069"
"36065",786,"view is to die for","ep069"
"36066",789,"all the furnishings come with this so","ep069"
"36067",792,"you're set ready turnkey move in I","ep069"
"36068",795,"absolutely love this property I think","ep069"
"36069",798,"Julia it's got its spot on here with","ep069"
"36070",801,"regards to the apartment itself its","ep069"

"36104",903,"I like it but it's still over budget and","ep069"
"36105",906,"besides that it's the location I felt","ep069"
"36106",909,"the location was still too central too","ep069"
"36107",912,"much in town I like a little bit more","ep069"
"36108",915,"space I did feel that Nate would","ep069"
"36109",918,"have that feeling of it being too","ep069"
"36110",921,"central to town but that's exactly what","ep069"
"36111",924,"I'm looking for so it's very difficult","ep069"
"36112",927,"to compromise","ep069"
"36113",930,"well it's decent-sized a great spot for","ep069"

"36118",945,"budget being slightly over I do like the","ep069"
"36119",948,"size of the place and the fact that it's","ep069"
"36120",951,"so maintenance but it still feels a","ep069"
"36121",954,"little bit too much like it's in town","ep069"
"36122",957,"for me and the apartment block idea I'm","ep069"
"36123",960,"not so sure about the hunt goes farther","ep069"

"36142",1017,"somewhere rural a little bit of peace","ep069"
"36143",1020,"and quiet would be great while Cass","ep069"

"36150",1041,"completely off grid well like this this","ep069"
"36151",1044,"is kind of your living and bedroom combo","ep069"
"36152",1047,"it really was quite overwhelming how","ep069"
"36153",1050,"small it was but not for Nate it's","ep069"
"36154",1053,"exactly what I want house 2 is more","ep069"
"36155",1056,"spacious but it's in a busy location","ep069"
"36156",1059,"close to town this is amazing","ep069"
"36157",1062,"I like the modern facilities and I like","ep069"
"36158",1065,"the space but it still feels like the","ep069"
"36159",1068,"city to me how do you feel now about","ep069"
"36160",1071,"leaving the city I'm really pleased I","ep069"
"36161",1074,"live the city actually","ep069"
"36162",1077,"at least not happy with house 3 Juliet","ep069"
"36163",1080,"brings the house hunt farther from town","ep069"
"36164",1083,"I really thought that it would help Nate","ep069"
"36165",1086,"feel a little bit more private beach is","ep069"
"36166",1089,"always empty here beautiful this 3","ep069"
"36167",1092,"bedrooms 2 baths you can step out the","ep069"
"36168",1095,"door and put your toes in the sand I can","ep069"
"36169",1098,"hear the ocean from here so I'm guessing","ep069"
"36170",1101,"this is well over budget it's 1,500 a","ep069"
"36171",1104,"month it's quite a bit over the budget","ep069"
"36172",1107,"actually but a lot the location though","ep069"
"36173",1110,"the locations are no brainer it's","ep069"
"36174",1113,"absolutely fantastic but two points it's","ep069"
"36175",1116,"still not in town for me and also with","ep069"
"36176",1119,"it being over budget it just puts a","ep069"
"36177",1122,"little bit extra pressure on a","ep069"
"36178",1125,"relationship so that's still a huge","ep069"
"36179",1128,"consideration for us for me it's a","ep069"
"36180",1131,"little bit retro inside but the","ep069"
"36181",1134,"locations fantastic so yeah I'm","ep069"
"36182",1137,"definitely pretty Keens just the budget","ep069"
"36183",1140,"that is the main issue here I like a","ep069"
"36184",1143,"little bit of character in the house","ep069"
"36185",1146,"location is just unbelievably fantastic","ep069"
"36186",1149,"and then you need wood like that too","ep069"
"36187",1152,"although perhaps a little bit quiet I","ep069"
"36188",1155,"was really hoping for caffee's to walk","ep069"
"36189",1158,"to restaurants the buzz of people going","ep069"
"36190",1161,"past and the tone location although it's","ep069"
"36191",1164,"only a five-minute drive from town I'll","ep069"
"36192",1167,"be having the vehicle for work so that","ep069"
"36193",1170,"makes it at least a half hour walk for","ep069"
"36194",1173,"her so it's not ideal in that respect ok","ep069"
"36195",1176,"guys the kitchen has everything you","ep069"
"36196",1179,"could need you've got a nice stove","ep069"
"36197",1182,"dishwasher microwave you've got views","ep069"
"36198",1185,"out every direction can you imagine","ep069"
"36199",1188,"having dinner and sitting and watching","ep069"
"36200",1191,"the ocean every night oh definitely time","ep069"
"36201",1194,"I feel the appliances are a little dated","ep069"
"36202",1197,"and stove tops electric so that's gonna","ep069"
"36203",1200,"add more to the cost certainly can't","ep069"
"36204",1203,"deny the views out the window yeah oh","ep069"
"36205",1206,"this is a sweet bedroom nice little bit","ep069"
"36206",1209,"this is considered your master bedroom","ep069"
"36207",1212,"you do have an ensuite here oh that's a","ep069"
"36208",1215,"great bonus I didn't expect that","ep069"
"36209",1218,"yeah and it's a little bit tight but you","ep069"
"36210",1221,"have high ceilings and exposed beams","ep069"
"36211",1224,"makes it feel a bit bigger yeah and","ep069"
"36212",1227,"great views everywhere you look again","ep069"
"36213",1230,"absolutely oh yeah this is sweet","ep069"
"36214",1233,"you have an identical bathroom","ep069"
"36215",1236,"downstairs so you have two baths that's","ep069"
"36216",1239,"pretty much all we need except for a","ep069"
"36217",1242,"bath","ep069"
"36218",1245,"qez are still very new to new zealand","ep069"
"36219",1248,"and living on the beach and having the","ep069"
"36220",1251,"beach experience is important but I","ep069"
"36221",1254,"think equally so being surrounded by","ep069"
"36222",1257,"civilization so she doesn't quite feel","ep069"
"36223",1260,"so secluded at the end of the day cares","ep069"
"36224",1263,"is happiness is most important here this","ep069"
"36225",1266,"is a great-sized room this is a great","ep069"
"36226",1269,"room for you to have guests it's the","ep069"
"36227",1272,"second bedroom there's also a third","ep069"
"36228",1275,"single bedroom if you need even more","ep069"
"36229",1278,"room for guests that will be excellent","ep069"
"36230",1281,"for when mom and dads come over to stay","ep069"
"36231",1284,"in there's a larger room than the master","ep069"
"36232",1287,"so yeah they have plenty room that's","ep069"
"36233",1290,"good to have that extra space for family","ep069"
"36234",1293,"and friends to come and stay as well and","ep069"
"36235",1296,"they're gonna want to and it's this","ep069"
"36236",1299,"close to the beach oh my god look at","ep069"
"36237",1302,"this this is executive pretty","ep069"
"36238",1305,"spectacular I'm loving the location the","ep069"
"36239",1308,"beach house still feels just a little","ep069"
"36240",1311,"bit dated inside but it's functional and","ep069"
"36241",1314,"it's got everything that we need and you","ep069"
"36242",1317,"certainly can't beat this that's exactly","ep069"
"36243",1320,"what we dreamed of this beach in itself","ep069"
"36244",1323,"is just out of this world so it's really","ep069"
"36245",1326,"easy to get carried away with the","ep069"
"36246",1329,"excitement of paradise but it's","ep069"
"36247",1332,"considerably over budget so we still","ep069"
"36248",1335,"have some thinking to do it's a little","ep069"
"36249",1338,"over budget well quite a bit over budget","ep069"
"36250",1341,"but I still can't rule it out I'm just","ep069"
"36251",1344,"loving where it is of slightly out of","ep069"
"36252",1347,"town","ep069"
"36253",1350,"okay well let's have a think about it","ep069"
"36254",1353,"Juliette's had a really tough job from","ep069"
"36255",1356,"the start trying to find something","ep069"
"36256",1359,"closest to town rustic modern","ep069"
"36257",1362,"low-maintenance is definitely gonna be","ep069"
"36258",1365,"allowed to compromise in the middle","ep069"
"36259",1368,"there somewhere they're hunting for a","ep069"
"36260",1371,"home on the Coromandel Peninsula with","ep069"
"36261",1374,"very different wishes I thought the","ep069"
"36262",1377,"location was perfect","ep069"
"36263",1380,"I couldn't think of anything worse","ep069"
"36264",1383,"[Music]","ep069"
"36265",1386,"from the moment they first met Kazon 8","ep069"
"36266",1389,"knew they were right for each other we","ep069"
"36267",1392,"just kept on staying in touch for phone","ep069"
"36268",1395,"calls","ep069"
"36269",1398,"hours of phone calls then built the","ep069"
"36270",1401,"relationship very slowly that way for","ep069"
"36271",1404,"about five months it was a bit of an","ep069"
"36272",1407,"old-fashioned romance really now just","ep069"
"36273",1410,"months into a brand-new relationship","ep069"
"36274",1413,"Kaz and Nate have decided to hunt for a","ep069"
"36275",1416,"home away from the big city I know you","ep069"
"36276",1419,"have been talking about going up and","ep069"
"36277",1422,"seeing the Coromandel we could go off","ep069"
"36278",1425,"and you could ever look around yeah so","ep069"
"36279",1428,"their hunt began with a remote cottage","ep069"
"36280",1431,"on the Coromandel Peninsula 20 minutes","ep069"
"36281",1434,"from the town of fiddy anga I really","ep069"
"36282",1437,"liked the location of the place out in","ep069"
"36283",1440,"the bush I know it's a little small","ep069"
"36284",1443,"but it's also under budget it was way","ep069"
"36285",1446,"too small family and friends can't come","ep069"
"36286",1449,"to stay and personally it was way too","ep069"
"36287",1452,"far out in the bush for me so Julia","ep069"
"36288",1455,"brought the hunt closer to town with","ep069"
"36289",1458,"house 2 there that one was really","ep069"
"36290",1461,"special","ep069"
"36291",1464,"we had the extra bedroom I felt fine","ep069"
"36292",1467,"about the budget it just wasn't too sure","ep069"
"36293",1470,"about where it was situated it just","ep069"
"36294",1473,"still felt a little silly like being an","ep069"
"36295",1476,"apartment but nice appliances","ep069"
"36296",1479,"heddle the space that we needed each","ep069"
"36297",1482,"front house 3 cotton eights I absolutely","ep069"
"36298",1485,"love the location of the third place","ep069"
"36299",1488,"right on the water","ep069"
"36300",1491,"two bathrooms one ensuite but it was","ep069"
"36301",1494,"hugely over-budget but I still can't see","ep069"
"36302",1497,"past where it's located the tough choice","ep069"
"36303",1500,"yeah absolutely","ep069"
"36304",1503,"what's the thinking to do","ep069"
"36305",1506,"[Music]","ep069"
"36306",1509,"well I think we really need to make a","ep069"
"36307",1512,"decision here and perhaps scratch one","ep069"
"36308",1515,"off the list what do you think I would","ep069"
"36309",1518,"love to take the country cottage off the","ep069"
"36310",1521,"list","ep069"
"36311",1524,"really I thought the location was","ep069"
"36312",1527,"perfect it's perfect for you moose","ep069"
"36313",1530,"hunting the rivers right there","ep069"
"36314",1533,"no neighbors around I really wanted to","ep069"
"36315",1536,"get that vibe and move out of the city","ep069"
"36316",1539,"and just forget about you know people","ep069"
"36317",1542,"it's just too far I'm afraid Plus yeah","ep069"
"36318",1545,"I'd be a little bit concerned with","ep069"
"36319",1548,"getting home late at night and you're","ep069"
"36320",1551,"stuck out there so that's not ideal","ep069"
"36321",1554,"that's definitely off the less than I","ep069"
"36322",1557,"think so","ep069"
"36323",1560,"the beach house or the town apartment","ep069"
"36324",1563,"well I really love the beach house it's","ep069"
"36325",1566,"the location is exactly where I wanted","ep069"
"36326",1569,"to be you know when we talked about","ep069"
"36327",1572,"leaving the city it was either the bush","ep069"
"36328",1575,"or the beach the beach house was a","ep069"
"36329",1578,"little bit dated insides but I think","ep069"
"36330",1581,"that's part and parcel of the whole","ep069"
"36331",1584,"beach house experience I want to be","ep069"
"36332",1587,"close to the water if I can't have the","ep069"
"36333",1590,"bush then that's what I'm gonna go for","ep069"
"36334",1593,"but I definitely loved the town","ep069"
"36335",1596,"apartment I think you would get over the","ep069"
"36336",1599,"fact that it's in town you're still","ep069"
"36337",1602,"thinking City but it's not we're in a","ep069"
"36338",1605,"very small town though yes it is in the","ep069"
"36339",1608,"tone but it had everything we were","ep069"
"36340",1611,"looking for that was a clear winner for","ep069"
"36341",1614,"me the beach house was largest but it","ep069"
"36342",1617,"was hugely over her budget","ep069"
"36343",1620,"the price was $1,500 a month yeah I","ep069"
"36344",1623,"guess the price is a bit of a factor I","ep069"
"36345",1626,"mean we don't exactly know what we're","ep069"
"36346",1629,"going to be doing for work just yet and","ep069"
"36347",1632,"it'll pretty much tap through the","ep069"
"36348",1635,"savings quite fast so tell me what","ep069"
"36349",1638,"you're thinking","ep069"
"36350",1641,"well the toun apartment has a view of","ep069"
"36351",1644,"the beach so I'm hoping that would","ep069"
"36352",1647,"contribute towards you potentially being","ep069"
"36353",1650,"sweet towards its own apartment so it","ep069"
"36354",1653,"sounds like we're starting to come","ep069"
"36355",1656,"towards a decision here you've reached a","ep069"
"36356",1659,"decision well I guess if that's what's","ep069"
"36357",1662,"gonna make you happy","ep069"
"36358",1665,"there is the room it is modern and clean","ep069"
"36359",1668,"so the best what you want then yeah","ep069"
"36360",1671,"let's do it","ep069"
"36361",1674,"does that mean we've reached a decision","ep069"
"36362",1677,"[Laughter]","ep069"

"36523",405,"thing","ep070"
"36524",408,"[Music]","ep070"
"36525",411,"ideally in our new place we'd find","ep070"

"36572",552,"and character of the home one of the","ep070"
"36573",555,"things that is kind of sad about these","ep070"
"36574",558,"vintage homes and some of the ones that","ep070"
"36575",561,"we've seen is that they go in and they","ep070"
"36576",564,"take away all those details and that","ep070"
"36577",567,"charm told them that so that is a","ep070"
"36578",570,"support column it's load-bearing they","ep070"
"36579",573,"see a formal dining room and a","ep070"
"36580",576,"first-floor bath this kitchen is just so","ep070"
"36581",579,"dark and not original well you wanted an","ep070"
"36582",582,"old vintage house you're probably gonna","ep070"
"36583",585,"get a dark kitchen where they cook is","ep070"
"36584",588,"slaving away in the back but if we're","ep070"
"36585",591,"talking about you know ripping out","ep070"
"36586",594,"cabinets and getting new appliances and","ep070"
"36587",597,"remodel the entire kitchen that can take","ep070"
"36588",600,"a lot of time and money","ep070"
"36589",603,"I think Nicole is trying to get both a","ep070"
"36590",606,"vintage charm and mu","ep070"
"36591",609,"ready and those are two beasts that","ep070"
"36592",612,"don't always follow the same master if","ep070"
"36593",615,"you will she's gonna have to take on a","ep070"
"36594",618,"few of these projects if she wants to","ep070"
"36595",621,"get her vintage charming house off the","ep070"
"36596",624,"kitchen is the outdoor space and not","ep070"
"36597",627,"much of a backyard there's space to","ep070"
"36598",630,"entertain nor space for Henry back","ep070"
"36599",633,"inside they head up to the second level","ep070"
"36600",636,"on the upper floor here you'll find all","ep070"
"36601",639,"four bedrooms as well as one bathroom","ep070"
"36602",642,"back in the 19th century all the bedding","ep070"
"36603",645,"shared a bathroom okay really a double","ep070"
"36604",648,"shower yeah I don't think it's gonna be","ep070"
"36605",651,"what you envisioned no yeah we play","ep070"
"36606",654,"y'all won't fit in there yeah so try it","ep070"
"36607",657,"so here is the the back bedroom this","ep070"
"36608",660,"could be your music room okay what's","ep070"
"36609",663,"this uh people and this is where the","ep070"
"36610",666,"home originally ended and this was","ep070"
"36611",669,"probably a window okay that's a little","ep070"
"36612",672,"strange thing to keep in in the middle","ep070"
"36613",675,"of a house this is yet another bedroom","ep070"
"36614",678,"however because there is no master","ep070"
"36615",681,"bathroom you could convert this into one","ep070"
"36616",684,"you have enough space for a large shower","ep070"
"36617",687,"okay","ep070"
"36618",690,"next door is the master bedrooms it's a","ep070"
"36619",693,"decent amount of space I like the","ep070"
"36620",696,"fireplace here which is somewhat","ep070"
"36621",699,"original yeah this original I believe","ep070"
"36622",702,"it's just been painted over and not sure","ep070"
"36623",705,"if you noticed but there is no closet in","ep070"
"36624",708,"this room again it was a feature that","ep070"
"36625",711,"they didn't really think about back in","ep070"
"36626",714,"the late 19th century the closets","ep070"
"36627",717,"located outside of the bedroom I mean","ep070"
"36628",720,"you can fit all your shoes in that yeah","ep070"
"36629",723,"nothing else","ep070"
"36630",726,"[Music]","ep070"
"36631",729,"make the house the way we want it so","ep070"
"36632",732,"that's a good thing yeah definitely I","ep070"
"36633",735,"mean it has all the vintage character","ep070"
"36634",738,"and charm that I like but there's really","ep070"
"36635",741,"a lot of projects I think it would be","ep070"
"36636",744,"worth the investment to improve certain","ep070"
"36637",747,"things in the house at the kitchen and","ep070"
"36638",750,"upgrade the bathrooms at a big closet","ep070"
"36639",753,"and this neighborhood is really growing","ep070"
"36640",756,"in value it's transitioning and I think","ep070"
"36641",759,"you'd be ahead of the boom if you bought","ep070"
"36642",762,"it now these Chicago row homes there's a","ep070"
"36643",765,"certain charm to them but at the same","ep070"
"36644",768,"time I'm secretly hoping that we can","ep070"
"36645",771,"find somewhere this contemporary that","ep070"
"36646",774,"would suit my style so now their brokers","ep070"
"36647",777,"showing them something more contemporary","ep070"
"36648",780,"for dunston but how much is it listed","ep070"
"36649",783,"for 529 whoa that's way over our budget","ep070"
"36650",786,"[Music]","ep070"
"36651",789,"oh great Chicago couple Nicole and","ep070"
"36652",792,"Dunstan have a budget of $500,000 to buy","ep070"
"36653",795,"their first home before they tie the","ep070"
"36654",798,"knot so far they've seen an under budget","ep070"
"36655",801,"row home with vintage details for Nicole","ep070"
"36656",804,"but it had none of the contemporary vibe","ep070"
"36657",807,"Dunston is looking for so their broker","ep070"
"36658",810,"is lined up a place that needs no","ep070"
"36659",813,"renovation and is more to Dunstan's","ep070"
"36660",816,"taste plus it's only a 30-minute bike","ep070"
"36661",819,"ride to his office all right today we","ep070"
"36662",822,"are in Logie square it's very hip","ep070"

"36673",855,"very modern in contemporary and it's the","ep070"
"36674",858,"top two floors of this building to be","ep070"
"36675",861,"penthouse unit oh wow that sounds really","ep070"
"36676",864,"nice it's not much to it in terms of","ep070"

"36686",894,"very modern right you say that like it's","ep070"

"36688",900,"appliances you got double freezer here","ep070"
"36689",903,"nice new of them yeah but I don't think","ep070"
"36690",906,"I'm a fan of these cabinets at all","ep070"
"36691",909,"there's no defined space for the dining","ep070"
"36692",912,"room table and and just entertaining I","ep070"
"36693",915,"mean do we want the TV to be five feet","ep070"
"36694",918,"away from the sofa","ep070"
"36695",921,"Nicole's really hesitant to live","ep070"
"36696",924,"somewhere that doesn't have defined","ep070"
"36697",927,"spaces but I think we've got enough room","ep070"
"36698",930,"here where we can set up a dining room","ep070"
"36699",933,"space living room space and they'll be","ep070"
"36700",936,"great for entertaining you know you have","ep070"
"36701",939,"everyone in one room together","ep070"
"36702",942,"is this a gas fireplace","ep070"
"36703",945,"that is gas fireplace yes very","ep070"
"36704",948,"contemporary yeah I'm not a fan of it","ep070"
"36705",951,"there's not even a mantel when you walk","ep070"
"36706",954,"into a contemporary space like this I","ep070"
"36707",957,"feel like it's lacking character lacking","ep070"
"36708",960,"a bit of history lacking a bit of soul","ep070"
"36709",963,"to be honest oh it's a little loud out","ep070"
"36710",966,"here yeah it's a little noisy but I mean","ep070"
"36711",969,"it's a nice big balcony yeah it's a lot","ep070"
"36712",972,"of space I guess they head back inside","ep070"
"36713",975,"so on the upper floors where you find","ep070"
"36714",978,"all three bedrooms and the two full","ep070"
"36715",981,"bathrooms","ep070"
"36716",984,"there's the smallest bedroom you can use","ep070"
"36717",987,"it as your music room Boston it's tiny I","ep070"
"36718",990,"don't know it will work the music room","ep070"
"36719",993,"might be even too small for that and you","ep070"
"36720",996,"got your guest bathroom and you're just","ep070"
"36721",999,"bedroom okay oh it's nice that the","ep070"
"36722",1002,"guests will have access to the patio and","ep070"
"36723",1005,"then lastly we have the master bedroom","ep070"
"36724",1008,"so bit on the smaller side I've gotta","ep070"
"36725",1011,"say you got a nice ceiling height and","ep070"
"36726",1014,"you have an attached private deck you","ep070"
"36727",1017,"know that is nice it's nice and bright","ep070"
"36728",1020,"at least in the house expose your","ep070"
"36729",1023,"walkthrough closet area got your kids in","ep070"

"36739",1053,"for you oh hello","ep070"
"36740",1056,"it's brand-new so there are no projects","ep070"
"36741",1059,"to tackle and so I'm not a fan of the","ep070"
"36742",1062,"undefined space and in general this","ep070"
"36743",1065,"place lacks character it's a little","ep070"
"36744",1068,"sterile well I'll just call this amazing","ep070"
"36745",1071,"kitchen right here it's nice modern new","ep070"
"36746",1074,"so it's got this open floor plan it is","ep070"
"36747",1077,"way above our budget","ep070"
"36748",1080,"yeah that's a lot to think about let's","ep070"
"36749",1083,"keep looking so their brokers showing","ep070"
"36750",1086,"them something more affordable there's a","ep070"
"36751",1089,"trade-off it's a fourth bad green half","ep070"
"36752",1092,"bath row home we step 425 it sounds like","ep070"
"36753",1095,"it might be a little far to cycle","ep070"
"36754",1098,"they're keeping busy engage Chicago","ep070"
"36755",1101,"professionals Dunstan in a cold want to","ep070"
"36756",1104,"buy a home within their $500,000 budget","ep070"
"36757",1107,"they've already seen a vintage Rojo","ep070"
"36758",1110,"Nicole's style with a low price tag but","ep070"
"36759",1113,"it needed renovation Nicole doesn't want","ep070"
"36760",1116,"to do they've also seen a new","ep070"
"36761",1119,"construction home that was move-in ready","ep070"
"36762",1122,"and Dunstan's preferred contemporary","ep070"
"36763",1125,"style but it was over budget so now","ep070"
"36764",1128,"their brokers brought them back to","ep070"
"36765",1131,"Bronzeville to see another option it's a","ep070"
"36766",1134,"nice blending of the old vintage that I","ep070"
"36767",1137,"think Nicole you will enjoy while it's","ep070"
"36768",1140,"been fully rehab on the inside so I","ep070"

"36777",1167,"windows are really really nice you're","ep070"
"36778",1170,"only about a 30-minute commute by train","ep070"
"36779",1173,"to your workplace no it sounds like it","ep070"
"36780",1176,"might be a little far to cycle that","ep070"
"36781",1179,"convenient on the train although it","ep070"
"36782",1182,"might be a little noisy in the station's","ep070"
"36783",1185,"right here so it's also a real good","ep070"
"36784",1188,"value it's a four-bed three and half","ep070"

"36798",1230,"completely gutted so that is brand-new","ep070"
"36799",1233,"oh that's a pity one of the things that","ep070"
"36800",1236,"I noticed that the developer did was","ep070"
"36801",1239,"take away all of the charm that you","ep070"
"36802",1242,"expect in an 1885 home he want those","ep070"
"36803",1245,"character pieces that are just missing","ep070"

"36848",1380,"really what I'm looking for but once we","ep070"
"36849",1383,"get inside it feels like they've","ep070"
"36850",1386,"stripped away out all the characters so","ep070"
"36851",1389,"I'm a little bit bummed about that which","ep070"
"36852",1392,"is great it's got the contemporary feel","ep070"
"36853",1395,"I definitely like the modern kitchen","ep070"
"36854",1398,"it's really nice and got the outdoor","ep070"
"36855",1401,"space close to the kitchens but it is a","ep070"
"36856",1404,"little bit too far to cycle to work and","ep070"
"36857",1407,"there is the noise from the Train their","ep070"
"36858",1410,"broker has shown them several properties","ep070"
"36859",1413,"with different things to offer so now","ep070"
"36860",1416,"their decision may hinge on price and","ep070"
"36861",1419,"style you ready to make the biggest","ep070"
"36862",1422,"decision of our lives I guess so","ep070"

"36864",1428,"I should try the fashion press really","ep070"
"36865",1431,"nice as well engaged couple Nicole and","ep070"
"36866",1434,"Dunstan have a budget of $500,000 to buy","ep070"
"36867",1437,"their first home in Chicago we need to","ep070"
"36868",1440,"make a final decision on where we're","ep070"
"36869",1443,"gonna live","ep070"
"36870",1446,"I guess we should start with the","ep070"
"36871",1449,"brownstone was it priced at 368 that's","ep070"
"36872",1452,"right one of the things I loved about it","ep070"
"36873",1455,"was just the curb of Hill walking in","ep070"
"36874",1458,"that neighborhood was amazing with the","ep070"
"36875",1461,"old brownstones and the cute yards","ep070"
"36876",1464,"there's still vintage character inside","ep070"
"36877",1467,"the house as well the Bannister was","ep070"
"36878",1470,"still original and you also have two","ep070"
"36879",1473,"fireplaces that are wood-burning but","ep070"
"36880",1476,"there are a lot of projects that have to","ep070"
"36881",1479,"be done in that home to make it you know","ep070"
"36882",1482,"move-in-ready well I mean there is a","ep070"
"36883",1485,"positive in that we can put our own","ep070"
"36884",1488,"stamp on it we can make our own master","ep070"
"36885",1491,"bathroom the way we want it to be maybe","ep070"
"36886",1494,"put in an extra closet for you I know","ep070"
"36887",1497,"there's something you wanted yeah","ep070"
"36888",1500,"definitely if they're it's lacking a","ep070"
"36889",1503,"closet space in there and no I need my","ep070"
"36890",1506,"shoe palace so what about the new","ep070"
"36891",1509,"construction that was priced at 5:29","ep070"
"36892",1512,"uh-huh so that is over our budget but","ep070"
"36893",1515,"we're getting a brand-new place you know","ep070"
"36894",1518,"brand-new kitchen by far the nicest","ep070"
"36895",1521,"kitchen of the ones we saw brand-new","ep070"
"36896",1524,"appliances that whole main area just had","ep070"
"36897",1527,"no character but at least it was","ep070"
"36898",1530,"completely move-in ready so that's","ep070"
"36899",1533,"really convenient but next to the","ep070"
"36900",1536,"fireplace you've got that deck the","ep070"
"36901",1539,"master bathroom was really nice yeah the","ep070"
"36902",1542,"big shower for two people so we should","ep070"
"36903",1545,"talk about the vintage row home yeah so","ep070"
"36904",1548,"that one was priced at 425 yeah I did","ep070"
"36905",1551,"love the curb appeal on that it was","ep070"
"36906",1554,"built in the 1800s it still has that","ep070"
"36907",1557,"look and feel but on the inside they","ep070"
"36908",1560,"stripped away all the real charming","ep070"
"36909",1563,"character it felt really long and narrow","ep070"
"36910",1566,"I mean now on the inside there's no","ep070"
"36911",1569,"produce there for you so you must be","ep070"
"36912",1572,"happy and it's really nice it's a bit","ep070"
"36913",1575,"noisy there with the train so close by","ep070"
"36914",1578,"but we could define the music room down","ep070"
"36915",1581,"in the finished basement are you","ep070"
"36916",1584,"thinking what I'm thinking in terms of","ep070"
"36917",1587,"our final decision","ep070"
"36918",1590,"[Music]","ep070"
"36919",1593,"are you leaning towards the vintage row","ep070"
"36920",1596,"huh I think they'll work it had that","ep070"
"36921",1599,"vintage great stone look so I like the","ep070"
"36922",1602,"outside of that place on the inside","ep070"
"36923",1605,"appealed to me and we have a nice open","ep070"
"36924",1608,"floor plan yes an offering okay let's","ep070"
"36925",1611,"call Garrett here we just moved in","ep070"
"36926",1614,"almost two weeks now still unpacking","ep070"
"36927",1617,"everything oh sure I'll take that","ep070"
"36928",1620,"Garrett was able to help us negotiate a","ep070"
"36929",1623,"good deal so we ended up paying four","ep070"
"36930",1626,"hundred five thousand I really feel that","ep070"
"36931",1629,"our new home is a good compromise","ep070"
"36932",1632,"between what me and Dunston want it has","ep070"
"36933",1635,"a vintage appeal on the outside and for","ep070"
"36934",1638,"Dunson it's nice and contemporary on the","ep070"
"36935",1641,"inside yeah that's true","ep070"
"36936",1644,"it's growing on me this open floor plan","ep070"
"36937",1647,"initially I was a little hesitant in","ep070"
"36938",1650,"terms of where we're gonna put things","ep070"
"36939",1653,"but now I can start repositioning things","ep070"
"36940",1656,"and you know modeling the house how I","ep070"
"36941",1659,"wouldn't want the layout to be I think","ep070"
"36942",1662,"Nichole is happy because she's been able","ep070"
"36943",1665,"to find a space for the living room in a","ep070"
"36944",1668,"space for the dining room they serve","ep070"
"36945",1671,"nicely separated by the kitchen time for","ep070"
"36946",1674,"a spot of cedar so although this kitchen","ep070"
"36947",1677,"wasn't quite as fancy as the one we saw","ep070"
"36948",1680,"in the new construction it's pretty good","ep070"
"36949",1683,"it has everything we need and it is very","ep070"
"36950",1686,"new Henry's been enjoying the new house","ep070"

"37450",1440,"had one bedroom one bath there was no","ep071"
"37451",1443,"yard for the dogs I didn't like the fact","ep071"
"37452",1446,"that the bedroom window was facing the","ep071"
"37453",1449,"outside like anyone could look in it was","ep071"
"37454",1452,"a busy street it's pretty noisy what","ep071"
"37455",1455,"about that traditional branch that was","ep071"
"37456",1458,"in the suburbs and that was nice it has","ep071"
"37457",1461,"the three bedrooms the hardwood floors a","ep071"
"37458",1464,"big yard for the dogs I knew you'd like","ep071"

"37460",1470,"didn't want three bedrooms we left","ep071"
"37461",1473,"Boston with a three bedroom home and we","ep071"
"37462",1476,"don't used one and remember the exterior","ep071"
"37463",1479,"remember how much work that was yeah and","ep071"
"37464",1482,"that was on the top of her budget","ep071"
"37465",1485,"it was one 60-49 for me though it's just","ep071"
"37466",1488,"a little too far from this trip what","ep071"
"37467",1491,"about that updated two-bedroom Spanish","ep071"
"37468",1494,"condo below our budget","ep071"
"37469",1497,"it was 135 but if I'm gonna get a condo","ep071"
"37470",1500,"I just want to be any other strip yeah","ep071"
"37471",1503,"but what about that kitchen everything","ep071"
"37472",1506,"was updated if I could just pick up that","ep071"
"37473",1509,"condo and put it right on the strip I","ep071"
"37474",1512,"think that'd be my ideal home we came","ep071"
"37475",1515,"here to be near the strip and although","ep071"
"37476",1518,"that condo near the strip was small","ep071"
"37477",1521,"think about all the amenities yeah I","ep071"
"37478",1524,"mean it did have a nice pool and I did","ep071"
"37479",1527,"have the gym we have two single home","ep071"
"37480",1530,"back home let's try something different","ep071"
"37481",1533,"let's be in the middle of everything and","ep071"
"37482",1536,"actually live it does sound like fun I","ep071"
"37483",1539,"think it would be a lot of fun all right","ep071"
"37484",1542,"I think we should call Dennis I think we","ep071"
"37485",1545,"brought more shoes than clothes with us","ep071"
"37486",1548,"guess we brought the essentials so we","ep071"
"37487",1551,"ended up getting the condo on the strip","ep071"
"37488",1554,"it was listed at 141 nine and we gave an","ep071"
"37489",1557,"offer 139 and they accepted it yes we've","ep071"
"37490",1560,"been here for about three weeks","ep071"
"37491",1563,"so the house did come furnished but we","ep071"
"37492",1566,"decided to get rid of the couch and buy","ep071"
"37493",1569,"a new couch the TV I was hoping to be","ep071"
"37494",1572,"able to change it and get something","ep071"
"37495",1575,"bigger but hey if it works keep it and","ep071"
"37496",1578,"although we only have one bedroom we got","ep071"
"37497",1581,"a big enough couch that oh my god this","ep071"
"37498",1584,"thing can sleep like two people","ep071"
"37499",1587,"comfortably it doesn't have much space","ep071"
"37500",1590,"but how often are we in here we just","ep071"
"37501",1593,"come here and sleep cook and go out got","ep071"
"37502",1596,"you no matter about this place are you","ep071"
"37503",1599,"look at this no not at all I think it's","ep071"

"37505",1605,"the balcony I just love the fresh air","ep071"
"37506",1608,"and I know I complain about the noisy","ep071"

"37508",1614,"we do a lot of work on the balcony","ep071"
"37509",1617,"actually and it's really nice to be able","ep071"
"37510",1620,"to get the fresh air while we work I","ep071"
"37511",1623,"think the dyes are getting used to it we","ep071"
"37512",1626,"bring them for walks we on the strip","ep071"

"37655",378,"about you wanting four bedrooms and I","ep072"
"37656",381,"think it might be possible to punch a","ep072"
"37657",384,"hole in that wall put in the door close","ep072"
"37658",387,"this off and then you could have the","ep072"
"37659",390,"fourth bedroom for additional income I","ep072"
"37660",393,"really like that idea it would be nice","ep072"
"37661",396,"to have the extra room to rent Oh seems","ep072"
"37662",399,"like a lot of work I don't mind the","ep072"
"37663",402,"extra work on estate it would kind of","ep072"
"37664",405,"give me something to do and get a little","ep072"
"37665",408,"greasy hear me think about it","ep072"
"37666",411,"Aaron and I have done a lot of","ep072"
"37667",414,"renovations on a house before so","ep072"

"37673",432,"electrical box right in the shower","ep072"
"37674",435,"not so much code in Nicaragua when you","ep072"
"37675",438,"see something like that water next to","ep072"
"37676",441,"electricity we call the Nicaraguan widow","ep072"
"37677",444,"Aaron and I might not have to have that","ep072"
"37678",447,"conversation about that fourth bedroom","ep072"
"37679",450,"if she convinces me to use that shower","ep072"
"37680",453,"with the Widowmaker I may not be around","ep072"

"37700",513,"and just hop in the water","ep072"
"37701",516,"I am absolutely surprised that this is","ep072"
"37702",519,"actually under our budget of $800 it's","ep072"
"37703",522,"more than I ever thought we'd be able to","ep072"
"37704",525,"afford there's a little bit more work","ep072"
"37705",528,"that we wouldn't initially need to put","ep072"
"37706",531,"into the house I think I was a little","ep072"
"37707",534,"bit of a downside because we will have","ep072"
"37708",537,"to invest that money and I'm crying I","ep072"
"37709",540,"don't mind the extra work I really do","ep072"
"37710",543,"like how Phocis to the beach and the","ep072"
"37711",546,"yard is absolutely massive and I really","ep072"
"37712",549,"like the house but it doesn't have that","ep072"
"37713",552,"extra room what I really wanted when it","ep072"
"37714",555,"comes to putting a hole in the wall to","ep072"
"37715",558,"make that fourth bedroom I understand","ep072"
"37716",561,"Aaron is a little bit concerned about it","ep072"
"37717",564,"that fourth bedroom to me is very","ep072"
"37718",567,"important I think it's gonna be more","ep072"
"37719",570,"work than and we probably initially","ep072"
"37720",573,"think Jordan has a surprise in store","ep072"
"37721",576,"when house to the fact that this house","ep072"
"37722",579,"has a pool","ep072"
"37723",582,"for me is fantastic the pool wasn't even","ep072"
"37724",585,"on our wish list at all it's gonna be","ep072"
"37725",588,"outside of your budget","ep072"
"37726",591,"ooh holy moly look at that me","ep072"

"37731",606,"the surf she was looking for in las","ep072"
"37732",609,"penitas Nicaragua a hot spot for sport","ep072"

"37745",648,"brings out my outgoing adventurous","ep072"
"37746",651,"nature 20 penis sharks in here you want","ep072"
"37747",654,"a house that we can rent out rooms we","ep072"
"37748",657,"have a little bit of extra income to","ep072"
"37749",660,"sustain what we have saved up we've","ep072"
"37750",663,"spent time together doing renovations","ep072"
"37751",666,"which is fine but it's not really","ep072"
"37752",669,"something that I want to do down here in","ep072"
"37753",672,"the heat I prefer a place that's kind of","ep072"
"37754",675,"move-in ready and start renting rooms","ep072"
"37755",678,"almost right away 3-bedroom 2bath but i","ep072"
"37756",681,"still think it can work for what you","ep072"
"37757",684,"guys want to do might be possible to","ep072"
"37758",687,"punch a hole in that wall and then you","ep072"
"37759",690,"could have the fourth bedroom for","ep072"
"37760",693,"additional income I think having that","ep072"
"37761",696,"fourth bedroom will definitely increase","ep072"
"37762",699,"the rental potential it seems like a lot","ep072"
"37763",702,"of work since we sold everything at home","ep072"
"37764",705,"and we're just relying on our savings","ep072"
"37765",708,"coming down here but the amount of money","ep072"
"37766",711,"that we need to put up front and the","ep072"
"37767",714,"maintenance that might be required","ep072"

"37967",1314,"of paint and maybe some new mattresses","ep072"
"37968",1317,"to make them ready to be rented out I","ep072"

"37993",1392,"house I like this location because it is","ep072"
"37994",1395,"quiet and just really","ep072"
"37995",1398,"the only thing that and I really didn't","ep072"
"37996",1401,"like about the house it wasn't in las","ep072"
"37997",1404,"peñitas and there wanted something","ep072"
"37998",1407,"closer to the restaurant plus penitas","ep072"
"37999",1410,"definitely has more restaurants but this","ep072"
"38000",1413,"is a little bit more laid-back and a","ep072"
"38001",1416,"little bit more","ep072"
"38002",1419,"tranquilo as they say here I honestly","ep072"
"38003",1422,"don't like the location in this home","ep072"
"38004",1425,"it's just too far removed from what I","ep072"
"38005",1428,"wanted but it is a bigger house that's","ep072"
"38006",1431,"actually on budget I know Aaron and I","ep072"
"38007",1434,"are gonna have to compromise on some","ep072"
"38008",1437,"things but I definitely don't want to","ep072"
"38009",1440,"compromise that much let's discuss so do","ep072"
"38010",1443,"we want to live in that big white house","ep072"
"38011",1446,"at the pool it was $300 over but it was","ep072"
"38012",1449,"but definitely had potential on Aaron's","ep072"
"38013",1452,"fourth trip to Nicaragua she and her","ep072"
"38014",1455,"boyfriend Shaun are looking for a home","ep072"
"38015",1458,"in las penitas but being on travelers","ep072"
"38016",1461,"thesis has a downside","ep072"
"38017",1464,"so we're not actually allowed to get","ep072"
"38018",1467,"jobs but as long as we can sublet rooms","ep072"
"38019",1470,"in our house that's fine then that","ep072"
"38020",1473,"should definitely help us sustain our","ep072"
"38021",1476,"life we head down here I'm getting that","ep072"
"38022",1479,"started we'll take a compromise between","ep072"
"38023",1482,"Sean's desire to live close to the","ep072"
"38024",1485,"action in a home he can renovate and","ep072"
"38025",1488,"Aaron's preference for a turnkey home in","ep072"
"38026",1491,"a quieter spot so that was quite the day","ep072"
"38027",1494,"we ought to be looking at how exactly so","ep072"
"38028",1497,"look that first one that that smaller","ep072"
"38029",1500,"way house we've got massive yard","ep072"
"38030",1503,"absolutely ridiculous this yard feels","ep072"
"38031",1506,"like an oasis to me it's just","ep072"
"38032",1509,"spectacular as soon as you walk in and","ep072"

"38035",1518,"master suite which was Tony separate","ep072"
"38036",1521,"from the other bedrooms did need quite a","ep072"
"38037",1524,"bit of work or they were ready to be","ep072"
"38038",1527,"rented oh I don't mind the extra work","ep072"
"38039",1530,"honestly though it kind of gave me","ep072"
"38040",1533,"something and then it wasn't fully","ep072"
"38041",1536,"furnished so we'd have to be investing","ep072"
"38042",1539,"that money upfront so Google under than","ep072"
"38043",1542,"that big white house with a pool it's","ep072"

"38051",1566,"over but it was but definitely had","ep072"
"38052",1569,"potential for more income and then there","ep072"
"38053",1572,"was that big yellow colonial right on","ep072"
"38054",1575,"budget the four bedrooms are just","ep072"

"38563",1341,"three this is a very easy to maintain","ep073"
"38564",1344,"and inexpensive to maintain one bathroom","ep073"

"38575",1377,"home in Tampa Florida after seeing","ep073"
"38576",1380,"several options it's decision time okay","ep073"
"38577",1383,"so the Mediterranean saw that you liked","ep073"
"38578",1386,"for six hundred and eighty five thousand","ep073"
"38579",1389,"dollars it is the style I'm looking for","ep073"
"38580",1392,"it has the garage and remember the","ep073"
"38581",1395,"master bath yeah the master bath was","ep073"
"38582",1398,"great that kitchen really overpowered","ep073"
"38583",1401,"the entire first floor and it's at the","ep073"
"38584",1404,"top of my price point and that back yard","ep073"
"38585",1407,"yard is a mess do you want to talk about","ep073"
"38586",1410,"the tutor for 650","ep073"
"38587",1413,"yeah it's 3300 square feet which meets","ep073"
"38588",1416,"my expectations but also it gives you","ep073"
"38589",1419,"the charm there is literally no yard but","ep073"
"38590",1422,"what yard there is is taken up by a nice","ep073"
"38591",1425,"pool it's a little too big it's a little","ep073"
"38592",1428,"too expensive and every single room","ep073"
"38593",1431,"needs work but it's charming it's","ep073"
"38594",1434,"adorable doesn't have a garage","ep073"
"38595",1437,"below with an additional one bedroom one","ep073"
"38596",1440,"back guesthouse it's move-in-ready I","ep073"
"38597",1443,"like the size the curb appeal is","ep073"
"38598",1446,"charming for five hundred and thirty","ep073"
"38599",1449,"nine thousand dollars I really like this","ep073"
"38600",1452,"one a lot it's your style but the","ep073"
"38601",1455,"bedrooms are tiny","ep073"
"38602",1458,"it says three-bedroom two-bath it's","ep073"
"38603",1461,"really two bedroom one bath in the main","ep073"
"38604",1464,"house I love the house it's great it's","ep073"
"38605",1467,"but the problem is it's too small","ep073"
"38606",1470,"at this price point I think adding up","ep073"
"38607",1473,"screened-in porch add a second bathroom","ep073"
"38608",1476,"a little bit down the road again no","ep073"
"38609",1479,"garage so if we had to eliminate one I","ep073"
"38610",1482,"would use each other","ep073"
"38611",1485,"so you don't like the Mediterranean I","ep073"
"38612",1488,"don't like the bungalow should we take a","ep073"
"38613",1491,"closer look at this Tudor I think it's a","ep073"
"38614",1494,"good compromise it's charming and","ep073"
"38615",1497,"adorable but I don't know if we can get","ep073"
"38616",1500,"a little bit back you can make the","ep073"
"38617",1503,"changes that you want okay","ep073"

"38624",1524,"room in the budget to make some major","ep073"
"38625",1527,"improvements as soon as I put this in","ep073"
"38626",1530,"here I'm gonna need you to water it in","ep073"

"38628",1536,"going on style-wise I've never heard of","ep073"
"38629",1539,"a Tudor but it does have a certain","ep073"
"38630",1542,"appeal to it because it is unique I get","ep073"
"38631",1545,"what I want","ep073"
"38632",1548,"size-wise but she also gets her","ep073"

"38659",1629,"painting them white and then new","ep073"
"38660",1632,"countertops new counters would really","ep073"

"39070",1224,"small but I think it's a very adequate","ep074"
"39071",1227,"space some bookshelves so I think it","ep074"

"39088",1278,"there and cool down I think it was","ep074"
"39089",1281,"almost the size of our master bath in","ep074"
"39090",1284,"Nashville I'm not sure all three of us","ep074"
"39091",1287,"could get in at one time for me it's a","ep074"
"39092",1290,"great commute it won't be bad and it is","ep074"
"39093",1293,"under budget at 4800 a month I do like","ep074"

"39099",1311,"want to make sure that we find something","ep074"
"39100",1314,"that really does check all the boxes for","ep074"
"39101",1317,"Michelle the reality is it comes down to","ep074"
"39102",1320,"two things price and location price is","ep074"
"39103",1323,"great location is great for me but it's","ep074"
"39104",1326,"not great for Michelle the ocean view","ep074"
"39105",1329,"house I really love that house it's just","ep074"
"39106",1332,"too bad that it is extremely over-budget","ep074"
"39107",1335,"so a couple months back would you have","ep074"
"39108",1338,"envisioned us being here no I would not","ep074"

"39110",1344,"to Melbourne smooth and easy I know what","ep074"
"39111",1347,"the number-one priority is it's the","ep074"

"39116",1362,"wouldn't really describe myself as a","ep074"
"39117",1365,"risk taker","ep074"
"39118",1368,"the oceanview house I really loved that","ep074"
"39119",1371,"house","ep074"
"39120",1374,"I always wanted to be able to watch the","ep074"

"39122",1380,"be able to see it from our balcony every","ep074"
"39123",1383,"day","ep074"
"39124",1386,"look at this dressing area it's","ep074"
"39125",1389,"fantastic and only six thousand dollars","ep074"
"39126",1392,"a month she dreams of their new life","ep074"
"39127",1395,"near the beach but Steve's hard line on","ep074"
"39128",1398,"the budget could be a deal-breaker","ep074"
"39129",1401,"it's an hour commute for me I'd like to","ep074"
"39130",1404,"see my family while we're in Australia","ep074"

"39132",1410,"ten minutes away from the beach and only","ep074"
"39133",1413,"two blocks away from the shops which is","ep074"
"39134",1416,"fantastic and I'd have the shorter","ep074"
"39135",1419,"commute house 2 comes up short on space","ep074"
"39136",1422,"for Michelle and Avery a little compact","ep074"
"39137",1425,"for me I think every might be a little","ep074"
"39138",1428,"sad that there's not a bigger playroom","ep074"
"39139",1431,"and the garden in the back seems a","ep074"
"39140",1434,"little small this is twice the size of a","ep074"
"39141",1437,"lot of the homes around here Wow and it","ep074"
"39142",1440,"still is a little over budget","ep074"

"39144",1446,"about me I like it this is a really nice","ep074"
"39145",1449,"entryway","ep074"

"39148",1458,"commute in under budget house 3 but I","ep074"
"39149",1461,"would have to drive to the beach drive","ep074"
"39150",1464,"to the shops I'm just not sure that one","ep074"
"39151",1467,"really works for me location wise","ep074"
"39152",1470,"[Music]","ep074"
"39153",1473,"I think if I could eliminate any of them","ep074"

"39155",1479,"plunge pool house yeah I'd have to say","ep074"

"39938",825,"yeah we got more modern I still think","ep076"
"39939",828,"it's a little too sterile like the","ep076"
"39940",831,"kitchen I want our guests to feel cozy I","ep076"
"39941",834,"feel very comfortable in here also on","ep076"
"39942",837,"this side of the house are three guest","ep076"
"39943",840,"bedrooms now the nice thing is that I","ep076"
"39944",843,"think that with four bedrooms we could","ep076"
"39945",846,"have both an office and a music room too","ep076"
"39946",849,"now right this way across the home to","ep076"
"39947",852,"the master bedroom all right sounds good","ep076"
"39948",855,"I like that master is on the other side","ep076"
"39949",858,"of the house yeah it keeps us away from","ep076"
"39950",861,"the kids it's a little small my bed and","ep076"
"39951",864,"a dresser would fit in here and not much","ep076"
"39952",867,"else","ep076"
"39953",870,"well one thing I'm noticing though is","ep076"
"39954",873,"that there's no master closet there","ep076"
"39955",876,"actually is it's just inside the master","ep076"
"39956",879,"bath it's like walking into heaven","ep076"

"39963",900,"head outside to see the backyard oh wow","ep076"

"39965",906,"it's very nice and of course we have a","ep076"
"39966",909,"Florida pool but who's gonna maintenance","ep076"
"39967",912,"it is there any way no there's no HOA so","ep076"
"39968",915,"you guys would definitely have to","ep076"
"39969",918,"maintain your own yard but I do like the","ep076"
"39970",921,"yard it's really spacious","ep076"
"39971",924,"this is great the dogs could run around","ep076"
"39972",927,"it's fenced in","ep076"
"39973",930,"yeah the fence is broken the dogs would","ep076"
"39974",933,"escape I think that it just takes a","ep076"
"39975",936,"little bit of patchwork and we can go","ep076"
"39976",939,"and get it right where it needs to be","ep076"
"39977",942,"there's a lot to like you I think yeah","ep076"
"39978",945,"it's a rancher I know that you like the","ep076"
"39979",948,"kitchen but it was a little too modern","ep076"
"39980",951,"for my taste","ep076"
"39981",954,"I like the master bathroom I like the","ep076"
"39982",957,"pool like the backyard but we're still","ep076"
"39983",960,"far away from my work in your work and","ep076"
"39984",963,"you know what they say location location","ep076"
"39985",966,"location but to be closer to their jobs","ep076"
"39986",969,"in the downtown area there's a bit of","ep076"
"39987",972,"give and take is this a townhouse","ep076"

"39993",990,"their family","ep076"
"39994",993,"I want our place to feel like home at","ep076"
"39995",996,"the end of the day right yes","ep076"
"39996",999,"not like a doctor's office so far","ep076"
"39997",1002,"they've seen a craftsman perfect for","ep076"
"39998",1005,"Holly it had a huge backyard but it was","ep076"
"39999",1008,"dated then they saw a ranch with the","ep076"
"40000",1011,"modern white kitchen Austin watts but","ep076"
"40001",1014,"both homes were over budget and a little","ep076"
"40002",1017,"far from their jobs in the downtown area","ep076"
"40003",1020,"so now they're going to see a place","ep076"
"40004",1023,"that's just 10 minutes from downtown is","ep076"
"40005",1026,"this a town house no it's definitely not","ep076"
"40006",1029,"very modern or Craftsman I don't like","ep076"
"40007",1032,"having a shared wall as a town house","ep076"
"40008",1035,"because we don't know who's gonna be","ep076"

"40015",1056,"in College Park real nice area town I","ep076"

"40017",1062,"of your bars and shops and restaurants","ep076"
"40018",1065,"are how much are we looking at actually","ep076"
"40019",1068,"only 285 really yeah that is under","ep076"
"40020",1071,"budget and it would allow for us to have","ep076"
"40021",1074,"some money maybe to do some renovations","ep076"
"40022",1077,"one quick thing sir is an HOA monthly","ep076"
"40023",1080,"it's 200 bucks a month but they do take","ep076"
"40024",1083,"care of most of the stuff outside if you","ep076"
"40025",1086,"have any roof problems so it does kind","ep076"
"40026",1089,"of pay for itself over time all right","ep076"
"40027",1092,"here we have well you might qualify as a","ep076"
"40028",1095,"den or an office also hardwood floors","ep076"
"40029",1098,"all the way throughout it looking real","ep076"
"40030",1101,"nice condition they see a half bath on","ep076"
"40031",1104,"the way to the kitchen oh wow","ep076"
"40032",1107,"the cabinets are a little too wood ish","ep076"
"40033",1110,"for me","ep076"
"40034",1113,"natural homey I mean they feel like","ep076"
"40035",1116,"they're like a decade old I would want","ep076"
"40036",1119,"to maybe paint them like white Austin","ep076"
"40037",1122,"really wants to go in and paint the","ep076"
"40038",1125,"cabinets if we end up with this house","ep076"
"40039",1128,"and that's just not gonna happen","ep076"
"40040",1131,"no way and I'm assuming this would be","ep076"
"40041",1134,"like a living room","ep076"
"40042",1137,"yeah this is probably - your main living","ep076"
"40043",1140,"space I like it lots of light lots of","ep076"
"40044",1143,"windows in this area and on top of that","ep076"
"40045",1146,"it's a great big space for hosting all","ep076"
"40046",1149,"right here we are backyard","ep076"
"40047",1152,"okay the bricks are cute but you can see","ep076"
"40048",1155,"like I can see the neighbor's garage","ep076"
"40049",1158,"door right there and I can see the front","ep076"
"40050",1161,"door of neighbors over there I like the","ep076"
"40051",1164,"backyard","ep076"
"40052",1167,"it's kind of small enough to manage back","ep076"
"40053",1170,"inside they head upstairs to a guest","ep076"
"40054",1173,"room that shares a jack-and-jill","ep076"
"40055",1176,"bathroom with another bedroom this would","ep076"
"40056",1179,"be a great like you know eventually","ep076"
"40057",1182,"nursery but before it's a nursery piano","ep076"
"40058",1185,"room so I'm thinking that this actually","ep076"
"40059",1188,"might be a great study the argument","ep076"
"40060",1191,"about a piano room or an office I say","ep076"
"40061",1194,"mine makes money it's an obvious","ep076"
"40062",1197,"decision down the hall they see the","ep076"
"40063",1200,"master suite oh wow yeah the color of","ep076"
"40064",1203,"the walls it's very breathable","ep076"
"40065",1206,"relatively spacious two master bath","ep076"
"40066",1209,"that's right this way oh I like it","ep076"
"40067",1212,"ah yes dual vanity","ep076"
"40068",1215,"I think the only other thing that I have","ep076"
"40069",1218,"to say about this room is that it is","ep076"
"40070",1221,"carpet oh yeah fresh out of the shower","ep076"
"40071",1224,"wet with carpet not a good combo well","ep076"
"40072",1227,"you know we could always look at with","ep076"
"40073",1230,"that extra money if we're gonna be under","ep076"
"40074",1233,"budget we could possibly do would force","ep076"
"40075",1236,"here as well oh we could find a home","ep076"
"40076",1239,"that doesn't have carpet that's true","ep076"
"40077",1242,"what'd you guys think I love the","ep076"
"40078",1245,"location","ep076"
"40079",1248,"it's close to downtown it's not too far","ep076"
"40080",1251,"from either of our jobs and I love the","ep076"
"40081",1254,"front door","ep076"
"40082",1257,"that's a win for me but it's a townhome","ep076"
"40083",1260,"definitely not a fan of the connection","ep076"
"40084",1263,"to neighbors and we just don't have a","ep076"
"40085",1266,"lot of physical land now they'll have to","ep076"
"40086",1269,"decide what's most important a","ep076"
"40087",1272,"single-family home staying on budget or","ep076"
"40088",1275,"getting a white kitchen okay time to","ep076"
"40089",1278,"make decision","ep076"
"40090",1281,"[Music]","ep076"
"40091",1284,"Austin and Molly are ready to settle","ep076"
"40092",1287,"down in Orlando Florida with a budget of","ep076"
"40093",1290,"$300,000 they've looked at a number of","ep076"
"40094",1293,"homes and are now ready to make a","ep076"
"40095",1296,"decision well what did you think about","ep076"
"40096",1299,"that craftsman that was three hundred","ep076"
"40097",1302,"and twenty four thousand it definitely","ep076"
"40098",1305,"was cute like you wanted but it was over","ep076"
"40099",1308,"budget and there are lots of projects to","ep076"
"40100",1311,"work on it but it was four bedrooms one","ep076"
"40101",1314,"of which was kind of a master suite oh","ep076"
"40102",1317,"my gosh that would be an incredible","ep076"
"40103",1320,"music room I think that it would be","ep076"
"40104",1323,"great as an office can we also talk","ep076"
"40105",1326,"about that backyard that was a great","ep076"
"40106",1329,"entertaining space would be great for","ep076"
"40107",1332,"our dogs and maybe for our kids one day","ep076"
"40108",1335,"but at the end of the day it's like 30","ep076"
"40109",1338,"to 40 minutes away from your work and","ep076"
"40110",1341,"like 30 minutes away from my work how","ep076"
"40111",1344,"about the ranch that was three hundred","ep076"
"40112",1347,"and nineteen thousand I mean it","ep076"
"40113",1350,"definitely was not the look that either","ep076"
"40114",1353,"of us likes I mean it was really bland","ep076"
"40115",1356,"super super bland on the outside but the","ep076"
"40116",1359,"home inside oh my gosh the vaulted","ep076"
"40117",1362,"ceilings the laminate slash wood floors","ep076"
"40118",1365,"laminate it looked real at night to the","ep076"
"40119",1368,"floors and the kitchen the kitchen was","ep076"
"40120",1371,"easily the best kitchen that we saw and","ep076"
"40121",1374,"I loved loved loved that kitchen I love","ep076"
"40122",1377,"to see you so happy but I was not a fan","ep076"
"40123",1380,"of that kitchen that's a little too","ep076"
"40124",1383,"sterile for me there was something","ep076"
"40125",1386,"cozier","ep076"
"40126",1389,"but that master bath was literally","ep076"
"40127",1392,"heaven in that backyard it was big and","ep076"
"40128",1395,"the pool was awesome I know you're","ep076"
"40129",1398,"excited about possibly having a pool but","ep076"
"40130",1401,"I just see dollar signs with the","ep076"
"40131",1404,"maintenance and it could be a safety","ep076"
"40132",1407,"issue if we grow our family and is a","ep076"
"40133",1410,"little outside the location that we","ep076"
"40134",1413,"wanted so what do you think the townhome","ep076"
"40135",1416,"that came in at two hundred and eighty","ep076"
"40136",1419,"five thousand you know I liked it it","ep076"
"40137",1422,"wasn't really either one of the styles","ep076"
"40138",1425,"that we wanted but it was two-story and","ep076"
"40139",1428,"I was kind of cute outside the kitchen","ep076"
"40140",1431,"was exactly what I wanted","ep076"
"40141",1434,"cozy warm inviting definitely a place","ep076"
"40142",1437,"that we could have people over it was a","ep076"
"40143",1440,"shared waldo oh yeah I don't like the","ep076"
"40144",1443,"idea of living with neighbors next to us","ep076"
"40145",1446,"they could be weird they could be","ep076"
"40146",1449,"strange don't really know you know wow","ep076"
"40147",1452,"it could be very loud","ep076"
"40148",1455,"had my music room but not a fourth","ep076"

"40616",1296,"property here okay maybe you can","ep077"
"40617",1299,"convince your guests it's the sound of","ep077"
"40618",1302,"the ocean it's a nice area for hosting","ep077"
"40619",1305,"but they're with the interstate right","ep077"
"40620",1308,"there it's not real relaxing for our","ep077"
"40621",1311,"guess the traffic is a little bit","ep077"
"40622",1314,"concerning but I think after maybe a few","ep077"
"40623",1317,"cocktails our guests won't care as much","ep077"
"40624",1320,"they head back inside to see two guest","ep077"
"40625",1323,"rooms and a shared bath before checking","ep077"
"40626",1326,"out the first master suite this is a","ep077"
"40627",1329,"nice space get the tray ceiling that's a","ep077"
"40628",1332,"nice touch though we got master bath","ep077"

"40642",1374,"I wish they had a separate room for the","ep077"
"40643",1377,"commode though we figure using the","ep077"
"40644",1380,"restroom and you get the whole bathroom","ep077"
"40645",1383,"so it could be one in the shower others","ep077"
"40646",1386,"use the restroom so we could I love the","ep077"
"40647",1389,"bathroom to the shower alone is worth","ep077"
"40648",1392,"taking that room for but that allows for","ep077"
"40649",1395,"the master bedroom downstairs to be","ep077"
"40650",1398,"rented out and I think that is a huge","ep077"
"40651",1401,"selling point so what's this way Doug","ep077"
"40652",1404,"I've got a bonus room over over on this","ep077"
"40653",1407,"side that's that same oh yeah look at","ep077"
"40654",1410,"the bar there the bar come with the","ep077"
"40655",1413,"house","ep077"
"40656",1416,"and we can ask for it this be a great","ep077"
"40657",1419,"room for entertaining absolutely it's","ep077"
"40658",1422,"gorgeous","ep077"
"40659",1425,"live it or not the rim gets bigger right","ep077"
"40660",1428,"this way oh wow the hallway yeah it's a","ep077"
"40661",1431,"whole nother room in here","ep077"
"40662",1434,"we get all kind of space back here wow I","ep077"
"40663",1437,"didn't think about a workout room for a","ep077"
"40664",1440,"bed and breakfast but it's early not a","ep077"
"40665",1443,"bad idea","ep077"
"40666",1446,"I really like the curb appeal I love the","ep077"
"40667",1449,"brick in the stonework I did have a","ep077"
"40668",1452,"really nice master bathroom you seem to","ep077"
"40669",1455,"love the tub in there I do like a little","ep077"
"40670",1458,"paint and I'll be turnkey-ready and not","ep077"
"40671",1461,"a lot of upkeep the kitchen wasn't huge","ep077"
"40672",1464,"I really like to have double ovens","ep077"
"40673",1467,"excellent outdoor living space as","ep077"
"40674",1470,"another thing that we're looking for","ep077"
"40675",1473,"it's a little loud though that's","ep077"
"40676",1476,"concerning since the the highway is so","ep077"
"40677",1479,"close the noise of the interstate that's","ep077"
"40678",1482,"something that really have to think","ep077"
"40679",1485,"about after seeing several options Jay","ep077"
"40680",1488,"and Amanda have a tough decision ahead","ep077"
"40681",1491,"of them their choice may come down to","ep077"
"40682",1494,"level of upkeep a covered patio or if","ep077"
"40683",1497,"they should live with or without a","ep077"
"40684",1500,"chef's kitchen it's a big decision and","ep077"
"40685",1503,"it's a big decision","ep077"
"40686",1506,"working with a budget of $625,000 J and","ep077"
"40687",1509,"Amanda have looked at several homes that","ep077"
"40688",1512,"can double as a bed-and-breakfast in the","ep077"
"40689",1515,"read evil Tennessee area now it's time","ep077"
"40690",1518,"to make a decision so what did you think","ep077"
"40691",1521,"about the Victorian farmhouse well I","ep077"
"40692",1524,"like the fact there's a Victorian it was","ep077"
"40693",1527,"all updated it was a little tight though","ep077"
"40694",1530,"in the kitchen area don't you think yeah","ep077"
"40695",1533,"the kitchen was definitely small and","ep077"
"40696",1536,"then upstairs had that weird bathroom","ep077"
"40697",1539,"situation that was one jacked-up","ep077"
"40698",1542,"bathroom one of the bonuses that had the","ep077"
"40699",1545,"building in the backyard that I think we","ep077"
"40700",1548,"could build out into one maybe two","ep077"
"40701",1551,"Suites priced only slightly higher is","ep077"
"40702",1554,"the historic colonial for five hundred","ep077"
"40703",1557,"and forty-nine thousand dollars that was","ep077"
"40704",1560,"exactly the house I picture when you say","ep077"
"40705",1563,"a bed-and-breakfast offers all the","ep077"
"40706",1566,"history that you can't get anywhere else","ep077"
"40707",1569,"the kitchen was amazing it's beautiful","ep077"
"40708",1572,"but then we have the bathrooms that need","ep077"
"40709",1575,"work the bathrooms were probably the","ep077"
"40710",1578,"worst ones out of the three houses it's","ep077"
"40711",1581,"also a lot of house all I see is all the","ep077"
"40712",1584,"work that needs to be done the","ep077"
"40713",1587,"traditional house was probably the","ep077"
"40714",1590,"prettiest house I think ahead was","ep077"
"40715",1593,"updated and at 600,000 it was also the","ep077"
"40716",1596,"most expensive home of the bunch the two","ep077"
"40717",1599,"master bedrooms so be a huge selling","ep077"
"40718",1602,"point","ep077"
"40719",1605,"the huge bonus room with the extra bonus","ep077"
"40720",1608,"room off of it this house was also very","ep077"
"40721",1611,"low maintenance the only thing I really","ep077"
"40722",1614,"needed to be done was changing a little","ep077"
"40723",1617,"bit of the paint colors and the","ep077"
"40724",1620,"wonderful outdoor living space that was","ep077"
"40725",1623,"definitely my favorite part about that","ep077"
"40726",1626,"house it's probably that oh goodness","ep077"
"40727",1629,"loud with the traffic all right it's a","ep077"
"40728",1632,"big decision it is a big decision","ep077"
"40729",1635,"so after all this discussion I think","ep077"
"40730",1638,"that um actually I can't leave I'm going","ep077"
"40731",1641,"to say this but I think the colonial is","ep077"
"40732",1644,"the one for us yes I think that's ideal","ep077"
"40733",1647,"for a bed-and-breakfast and the fact","ep077"
"40734",1650,"that we can make it a wedding venue","ep077"
"40735",1653,"that's something we didn't count on","ep077"
"40736",1656,"Khalid I make the offer let's call him","ep077"
"40737",1659,"all right whole thing over I think this","ep077"
"40738",1662,"property was out deals just land is","ep077"
"40739",1665,"breathtaking it's so beautiful and","ep077"
"40740",1668,"peaceful out here I think the wow factor","ep077"
"40741",1671,"with the home that we purchased the fact","ep077"
"40742",1674,"that it's got so much history three","ep077"
"40743",1677,"presidents have stayed here and it was","ep077"
"40744",1680,"used as an Army Hospital for the south","ep077"
"40745",1683,"and the north and the Civil War let's go","ep077"
"40746",1686,"swing in our gazebo we paid you two","ep077"
"40747",1689,"asking price at 549 but we didn't ago","ep077"
"40748",1692,"she ate all the furniture and all the","ep077"
"40749",1695,"tables of chairs that come along with","ep077"
"40750",1698,"the wedding venue so we saved a lot of","ep077"
"40751",1701,"money there as far as having to fill","ep077"
"40752",1704,"bunch of bedrooms and extra rooms there","ep077"
"40753",1707,"you think buddy pretty cool I think this","ep077"
"40754",1710,"property is gonna be a ton of work it's","ep077"
"40755",1713,"gonna be a lot of work but house is old","ep077"
"40756",1716,"I think that we really lucky with the","ep077"
"40757",1719,"kitchen that kitchen is amazing I","ep077"

"40816",123,"this purchase of 130,000 I tend to be a","ep078"
"40817",126,"little more practical so I'd like to","ep078"
"40818",129,"keep it a little lower than that if","ep078"
"40819",132,"possible I think if we go any lower we","ep078"
"40820",135,"might not find all the stuff that we","ep078"
"40821",138,"want we have a big wish list we are a","ep078"
"40822",141,"little picky yeah I feel like this space","ep078"
"40823",144,"is too small the first thing on their","ep078"
"40824",147,"list is a three bedroom house with good","ep078"
"40825",150,"sized bedrooms but they disagree on how","ep078"
"40826",153,"to use them all I think the dogs need","ep078"
"40827",156,"their own room I mean they have food and","ep078"
"40828",159,"they have water and they have toys I","ep078"
"40829",162,"don't know that we necessarily need a","ep078"
"40830",165,"whole room for the dogs that could","ep078"
"40831",168,"become accustomed that's where we differ","ep078"
"40832",171,"well that's a cute ranch I grew up in a","ep078"
"40833",174,"ranch home and to me that feels like","ep078"
"40834",177,"home","ep078"
"40835",180,"I don't like ranch Styles because","ep078"
"40836",183,"they're just like a big like","ep078"
"40837",186,"rectangle you know I don't like this at","ep078"
"40838",189,"all this is way more your style than","ep078"
"40839",192,"fine I mean it's the Cape Cod I like the","ep078"
"40840",195,"Cape Cod's it just looks like a perfect","ep078"
"40841",198,"little","ep078"
"40842",201,"ideal home and my biggest issue at them","ep078"
"40843",204,"as the ceilings and the upstairs are","ep078"
"40844",207,"like a dollhouse","ep078"
"40845",210,"and you just feel so closed in but","ep078"
"40846",213,"you're only five foot","ep078"
"40847",216,"that's a nice kitchen I like the white","ep078"
"40848",219,"cabinets in the stainless steel I kind","ep078"
"40849",222,"of want granite countertops just kind of","ep078"
"40850",225,"a big kitchen that's updated and it just","ep078"
"40851",228,"looks nice I definitely want moving","ep078"
"40852",231,"ready we don't really have any","ep078"
"40853",234,"experience with fixing things or","ep078"
"40854",237,"renovating anything we just kind of want","ep078"
"40855",240,"it done for us they also want a formal","ep078"
"40856",243,"dining room for Kayla's family visits","ep078"
"40857",246,"and a big fenced yard for their dogs and","ep078"
"40858",249,"themselves whoa","ep078"
"40859",252,"that's pretty cool probably putting","ep078"
"40860",255,"hammock and the garden back there yeah","ep078"
"40861",258,"that's true a hammock is kind of","ep078"
"40862",261,"something that's really important to","ep078"
"40863",264,"Kayla and I love reading laying in the","ep078"
"40864",267,"hammock um so there were a couple of","ep078"
"40865",270,"trees in the backyard that we could kind","ep078"
"40866",273,"of hook the hammock up to that'd be","ep078"
"40867",276,"awesome it would be number one","ep078"
"40868",279,"deal-breaker is closet space I mean to","ep078"
"40869",282,"women you have clothes out the wazoo Oh","ep078"
"40870",285,"two car garage that's true","ep078"
"40871",288,"Syracuse is like number two and top","ep078"
"40872",291,"snowfall in the entire country so it","ep078"
"40873",294,"would be absolutely amazing if we could","ep078"
"40874",297,"get some sort of garage we need it in","ep078"
"40875",300,"the snow but it's surprisingly difficult","ep078"
"40876",303,"to find in Syracuse most houses don't","ep078"
"40877",306,"have two car garages or a garage at all","ep078"
"40878",309,"which is confusing I am so excited to","ep078"
"40879",312,"start this process we have such a big","ep078"
"40880",315,"wish list I've kind of had our heart set","ep078"
"40881",318,"on it","ep078"
"40882",321,"hopefully we'll be able to find a good","ep078"
"40883",324,"compromise today their agent tisha has","ep078"
"40884",327,"lined up a home that's more Kayla style","ep078"
"40885",330,"okay today girls we're going to see a","ep078"
"40886",333,"raised ranch 129","ep078"
"40887",336,"three bedrooms one and a half baths but","ep078"
"40888",339,"it's really loud I know I know the","ep078"
"40889",342,"highway is right there but keep an open","ep078"
"40890",345,"mind you're gonna love this house","ep078"
"40891",348,"my relationship with Caroline is very","ep078"
"40892",351,"special and it goes back to when she was","ep078"
"40893",354,"a little girl when Caroline was younger","ep078"
"40894",357,"I used to watch her after school and","ep078"
"40895",360,"then as she got older and became a","ep078"
"40896",363,"teenager she would watch my boys when","ep078"
"40897",366,"they were growing up","ep078"
"40898",369,"I like it's cute I love the clean lines","ep078"
"40899",372,"of this house it's totally my style I","ep078"
"40900",375,"personally don't like ranches I just","ep078"
"40901",378,"kind of looks like a big rectangle to me","ep078"
"40902",381,"so I'm not a fan and there's only one","ep078"
"40903",384,"car garage I know I know but the garage","ep078"
"40904",387,"is long enough where you can actually","ep078"
"40905",390,"fit two cars tandem lis have to look at","ep078"
"40906",393,"something that Kayla likes I mean this","ep078"
"40907",396,"is what she wanted I never gave you","ep078"
"40908",399,"guess I'll have to turn compromise these","ep078"
"40909",402,"finishes are really nice I'm not a fan","ep078"

"40920",435,"where I like the natural sunlight Wow","ep078"

"40928",459,"oh this is cute oh it's cute so pretty","ep078"
"40929",462,"decent size yeah it is","ep078"
"40930",465,"I think the dogs would like it it is","ep078"
"40931",468,"nice that we wouldn't have to fence an","ep078"
"40932",471,"entire yard","ep078"
"40933",474,"yeah and that saves money and a place","ep078"
"40934",477,"for your hammock look those even though","ep078"
"40935",480,"oh good work yeah","ep078"
"40936",483,"back inside they take a look at the full","ep078"
"40937",486,"bag that's clean it's clean that's a","ep078"
"40938",489,"passing a brand-new and the two guest","ep078"
"40939",492,"rooms oh my goodness this is tiny","ep078"

"40942",501,"king-size bed is like right I don't give","ep078"
"40943",504,"you enough room for the king-size of it","ep078"
"40944",507,"if you do it that way okay still think","ep078"
"40945",510,"that I like for you","ep078"
"40946",513,"that's Caleb's clothes and now I need a","ep078"
"40947",516,"closet but there is an additional closet","ep078"
"40948",519,"right outside the room okay actually","ep078"
"40949",522,"could work yeah there's a lot of extra","ep078"
"40950",525,"space there even though the rooms tend","ep078"
"40951",528,"to be small in this house the closet","ep078"
"40952",531,"space is big enough for both of us which","ep078"
"40953",534,"is a big deal next they head downstairs","ep078"
"40954",537,"to the living room area it's definitely","ep078"
"40955",540,"nice it's finished and I don't think we","ep078"
"40956",543,"would change anything that's move-in","ep078"
"40957",546,"ready so that's pretty cool","ep078"
"40958",549,"[Applause]","ep078"

"40962",561,"house when you pull up the kitchen it's","ep078"
"40963",564,"not just that's exactly what we were","ep078"
"40964",567,"that's like everything on our checklist","ep078"
"40965",570,"everything is moving ready whoo the yard","ep078"
"40966",573,"is nice I think the biggest concern is","ep078"
"40967",576,"the size of all the rooms and there's no","ep078"
"40968",579,"formal dining room which is something I","ep078"
"40969",582,"really wanted if I do find something","ep078"
"40970",585,"with more square footage I believe that","ep078"
"40971",588,"it's going to cost more do you have any","ep078"
"40972",591,"room in your budget if we want to go up","ep078"
"40973",594,"the girls have a type by day they're","ep078"
"40974",597,"gonna have to start making some","ep078"

"40976",603,"everything that they want for in their","ep078"
"40977",606,"price range I think we can find a little","ep078"
"40978",609,"bit of wiggle room I'm not so sure I'm","ep078"
"40979",612,"not sure what tisha and Caroline are","ep078"
"40980",615,"trying to do but our budget is firm at","ep078"
"40981",618,"130,000 I really don't want a wiggle on","ep078"
"40982",621,"that because we have to keep it within","ep078"
"40983",624,"reality so tshis found another place","ep078"
"40984",627,"that fits the budget but Calum might","ep078"
"40985",630,"have to compromise on stuff","ep078"
"40986",633,"today we're gonna look at a cape","ep078"

"41033",774,"and see the backyard","ep078"
"41034",777,"it's more than I envisioned there's room","ep078"

"41036",783,"I do notice there's no fence oh yeah","ep078"
"41037",786,"there is no offense that's kind of a","ep078"
"41038",789,"concern yep","ep078"
"41039",792,"so that adds to the budget back inside","ep078"
"41040",795,"on the second floor they take a look at","ep078"
"41041",798,"the full bath and a bedroom I see","ep078"
"41042",801,"slanted ceilings definitely feels a","ep078"
"41043",804,"little claustrophobic okay Kayla doesn't","ep078"
"41044",807,"like Cape Cod's because of the slanted","ep078"
"41045",810,"roof so when we walked in and they were","ep078"
"41046",813,"slanted roofs upstairs I knew she was","ep078"
"41047",816,"gonna say something about that","ep078"
"41048",819,"I don't like Cape Cod's in this house","ep078"
"41049",822,"didn't really change my mind on that","ep078"
"41050",825,"would this be the master it could be","ep078"
"41051",828,"both of the rooms are very similar in","ep078"
"41052",831,"size okay do you think hangers would fit","ep078"
"41053",834,"I don't it's enough to come all the way","ep078"
"41054",837,"down here I don't think it'd work okay","ep078"
"41055",840,"well let's go look at the other bedroom","ep078"
"41056",843,"and see if you feel the same way still","ep078"
"41057",846,"has my feelings I'm guessing this is","ep078"
"41058",849,"gonna be this house virtually has zero","ep078"
"41059",852,"closet space in it I really think the","ep078"
"41060",855,"closets in this house are gonna be a","ep078"
"41061",858,"deal-breaker","ep078"
"41062",861,"[Music]","ep078"

"41067",876,"you don't need to do anything to that I","ep078"
"41068",879,"agree I think closet space is the number","ep078"
"41069",882,"one that involved yeah clonk spacing the","ep078"
"41070",885,"size of the rooms up definitely on rooms","ep078"
"41071",888,"I'm disappointed by the ceilings that's","ep078"
"41072",891,"my least favorite thing about a Cape Cod","ep078"
"41073",894,"and this house has them it does make me","ep078"
"41074",897,"sad to not have the ranch that's what I","ep078"
"41075",900,"had dreamed of","ep078"
"41076",903,"so now tshis found another ranch for","ep078"

"41205",1290,"for us and for animals the next stone","ep078"

"41213",1314,"two-car attached garage awesome I think","ep078"
"41214",1317,"for me the closet space was the biggest","ep078"
"41215",1320,"thing just because we have so many","ep078"
"41216",1323,"clothes between the two of us that","ep078"
"41217",1326,"potentially could be a deal-breaker for","ep078"

"41219",1332,"split-level ranch priced over budget at","ep078"

"41249",1422,"down to 120 to five I am so happy with","ep078"
"41250",1425,"the price that we got this home before","ep078"

"41384",309,"rounding out their wish list is a","ep079"
"41385",312,"two-car garage and a dedicated outdoor","ep079"
"41386",315,"space for the cats","ep079"
"41387",318,"we'd like a screened-in patio patio they","ep079"
"41388",321,"call it screened-in porch for the cat","ep079"
"41389",324,"we're so excited about buying a house","ep079"
"41390",327,"and also totally frightened I grew up","ep079"
"41391",330,"living in apartments in my immediate","ep079"
"41392",333,"family and I'm the first person to buy a","ep079"
"41393",336,"house and it's more exciting than scary","ep079"
"41394",339,"first up a modern farmhouse Ranch close","ep079"
"41395",342,"to downtown it's definitely not a","ep079"
"41396",345,"craftsman not much of a porch or","ep079"
"41397",348,"anything out front yeah it doesn't have","ep079"
"41398",351,"those bungalow touches that I like but","ep079"
"41399",354,"it's cute I don't see a garage here's","ep079"
"41400",357,"the house we're going to see today was","ep079"
"41401",360,"built in 1970 oh I like that","ep079"
"41402",363,"but there is no garage and we really","ep079"
"41403",366,"wanted that for the cat boxes well the","ep079"
"41404",369,"price is two hundred and thirty-five","ep079"
"41405",372,"thousand dollars that's in our budget","ep079"
"41406",375,"yeah working with first-time homebuyers","ep079"
"41407",378,"like Paul and ELISA is they're really","ep079"
"41408",381,"not aware of what's available in the","ep079"
"41409",384,"market so sometimes that's kind of a","ep079"
"41410",387,"culture shock for them to see what is","ep079"
"41411",390,"available and how much it costs versus","ep079"
"41412",393,"what they want kind of small but it's","ep079"
"41413",396,"nice I like the color of this room it's","ep079"
"41414",399,"like a light gray I match this wall","ep079"
"41415",402,"though right yeah matches my favorite","ep079"
"41416",405,"cat what do you think of the hardwood","ep079"
"41417",408,"floors are they hardwood they look like","ep079"
"41418",411,"vinyl plank","ep079"
"41419",414,"they don't fool me easy to clean and","ep079"
"41420",417,"these windows are fantastic the cats","ep079"
"41421",420,"would love them I really didn't like","ep079"
"41422",423,"that I don't love how open it is","ep079"
"41423",426,"if the front door was open you could","ep079"
"41424",429,"probably see my dirty dishes from across","ep079"
"41425",432,"the street I know this it doesn't like","ep079"
"41426",435,"the open concept but I think it being","ep079"
"41427",438,"open really makes it seem bigger than it","ep079"
"41428",441,"is like these countertops it's not","ep079"
"41429",444,"exactly what I had in mind for my","ep079"
"41430",447,"kitchen counters but it looks cool what","ep079"
"41431",450,"are you thinking these shelves here I","ep079"
"41432",453,"love them actually I think they're","ep079"
"41433",456,"really nice yeah I really like that yes","ep079"
"41434",459,"a gas stove just what you want that is","ep079"
"41435",462,"just that's really important now I","ep079"
"41436",465,"thought there's a separate eating area","ep079"
"41437",468,"right off the kitchen it's kind of tight","ep079"
"41438",471,"so this is just a two-person closet","ep079"
"41439",474,"there that closet is your laundry room","ep079"
"41440",477,"I thought it would be a pantry if it's","ep079"
"41441",480,"not a pantry where do we put our food","ep079"
"41442",483,"there isn't that much cabinet space here","ep079"
"41443",486,"you can also use those shelves over","ep079"
"41444",489,"there just having like cereal boxes and","ep079"
"41445",492,"just make sure you buy pretty packages","ep079"
"41446",495,"watch your step guys we need some new","ep079"
"41447",498,"stairs I love these big old trees yeah","ep079"
"41448",501,"the defense would definitely need work","ep079"
"41449",504,"and the neighbors are right there","ep079"
"41450",507,"picture it like a six-foot privacy fence","ep079"
"41451",510,"with these big old trees this would be a","ep079"
"41452",513,"really nice private backyard then we","ep079"
"41453",516,"could design our dream screened-in patio","ep079"
"41454",519,"all additional costs though","ep079"
"41455",522,"back inside they see the first bathroom","ep079"
"41456",525,"on the way to the bedrooms it's a little","ep079"
"41457",528,"small it's very small it's not big","ep079"
"41458",531,"enough for yoga I don't think it has","ep079"
"41459",534,"yeah this is no good we'll just get full","ep079"
"41460",537,"of fern","ep079"
"41461",540,"yeah with five pets and this is really","ep079"
"41462",543,"thick carpet no that's not usually a","ep079"
"41463",546,"complaint really you can balance on one","ep079"
"41464",549,"foot in here it could maybe work for an","ep079"
"41465",552,"office maybe without having the space","ep079"
"41466",555,"for the cat box itself would I have to","ep079"
"41467",558,"share that space with five pets it's","ep079"
"41468",561,"pretty inconvenient they check out","ep079"
"41469",564,"another bedroom and the master this is","ep079"
"41470",567,"the master bedroom","ep079"
"41471",570,"it's the biggest buy a little and an","ep079"
"41472",573,"ensuite bathroom oh it's nicely updated","ep079"
"41473",576,"like the first bathroom just like the","ep079"
"41474",579,"first bathroom I don't love it I don't","ep079"
"41475",582,"hate it it's okay","ep079"
"41476",585,"it's not a craftsman it's not a bungalow","ep079"
"41477",588,"but it is cute","ep079"
"41478",591,"my commute won't be so bad from here","ep079"
"41479",594,"about 20 minutes maybe a little bit more","ep079"
"41480",597,"with traffic it's quite a bit of work we","ep079"
"41481",600,"got to do outside a new fence and the","ep079"
"41482",603,"back steps I like that there's an office","ep079"
"41483",606,"space but it is pretty small I don't","ep079"
"41484",609,"know where we put the cat boxes and then","ep079"
"41485",612,"carpet can be throws we could build a","ep079"
"41486",615,"back patio and everything litter box in","ep079"
"41487",618,"the screened-in yes yeah I don't know","ep079"
"41488",621,"how much that's gonna cost","ep079"
"41489",624,"we don't want a lot of renovations so","ep079"
"41490",627,"their agent lines up another option but","ep079"
"41491",630,"in a location that might be outside","ep079"
"41492",633,"their idea of cool Robert where are we","ep079"

"41504",669,"thought charm in the kitchen and","ep079"
"41505",672,"potential in the backyard but Paul","ep079"
"41506",675,"didn't like that the house didn't have a","ep079"
"41507",678,"garage so today their agent has lined up","ep079"
"41508",681,"a place with the garage they're looking","ep079"
"41509",684,"for just outside their target area it's","ep079"
"41510",687,"a highway right there it's not a crass","ep079"
"41511",690,"name but might have some modern finishes","ep079"

"41535",762,"dining area over here and it's not in","ep079"
"41536",765,"the living space what do you think of","ep079"
"41537",768,"these floors Phil too much Brown for me","ep079"
"41538",771,"these tiles would have to go immediately","ep079"
"41539",774,"they're just a total eyesore","ep079"
"41540",777,"it's been upgraded marble countertops","ep079"
"41541",780,"I like those countertops trench think","ep079"
"41542",783,"huh here's the secondary bedroom carpets","ep079"
"41543",786,"to all the bedrooms some carpets they do","ep079"
"41544",789,"have carpet","ep079"
"41545",792,"I was thinking from my yoga space I was","ep079"
"41546",795,"hoping to have a room without carpet you","ep079"
"41547",798,"can always pull the carpet of it but","ep079"
"41548",801,"hardwood floors down that's more work to","ep079"
"41549",804,"do maybe I'm not this would make a great","ep079"
"41550",807,"office for me and this house has the","ep079"
"41551",810,"two-car garage so we don't have to make","ep079"
"41552",813,"one of these secondary bedrooms full of","ep079"

"41554",819,"master bedroom","ep079"
"41555",822,"whoo so how do I it's a little bit","ep079"
"41556",825,"bigger than our bedroom now I like the","ep079"
"41557",828,"ceilings if you said a nice feel","ep079"
"41558",831,"bathrooms right off it I really like","ep079"
"41559",834,"these countertops","ep079"
"41560",837,"and this vanity is kind of cool it kind","ep079"
"41561",840,"of has an antiquey style with the knobs","ep079"

"41563",846,"comes a shower","ep079"
"41564",849,"oh try it on ball yeah I think it's","ep079"
"41565",852,"definitely big enough what do you think","ep079"
"41566",855,"of those giant tiles it's really brown","ep079"
"41567",858,"tile here tell on the floor and then the","ep079"
"41568",861,"granite it's all kind of weird but it's","ep079"
"41569",864,"all done and it's new they head outside","ep079"
"41570",867,"to the yard this is not a screened-in","ep079"
"41571",870,"patio but I see there's this space so if","ep079"
"41572",873,"we wanted to build one one day a dolly","ep079"
"41573",876,"would really have plenty of room to run","ep079"
"41574",879,"around here it's all fenced in but that","ep079"
"41575",882,"house up on the hill over there it's","ep079"
"41576",885,"like they're looking right into our","ep079"
"41577",888,"house you can always plant trees it","ep079"
"41578",891,"would take some work I didn't really","ep079"
"41579",894,"like the kitchen","ep079"
"41580",897,"it wasn't the open concept that Paul","ep079"
"41581",900,"wanted but there was still a little bit","ep079"
"41582",903,"of opening so it was good compromise I","ep079"
"41583",906,"really like that there's the two-car","ep079"
"41584",909,"garage the cat litter boxes can go out","ep079"
"41585",912,"there well we might have to change out","ep079"
"41586",915,"one of the carpet","ep079"
"41587",918,"appropriate for yoga the space is good","ep079"
"41588",921,"then I really don't like that tile I","ep079"
"41589",924,"want to change it right away and take up","ep079"
"41590",927,"a tile floor it can't be an easy thing","ep079"
"41591",930,"how do you even do it","ep079"

"41596",945,"through with the place closer to","ep079"
"41597",948,"downtown but it might be a hard sell","ep079"

"42208",1182,"clutter down the fact that it doesn't","ep080"
"42209",1185,"have a basement is a little concerning","ep080"
"42210",1188,"but the back room is separate so I think","ep080"

"42648",957,"source if the lake is stocked with fish","ep081"
"42649",960,"we could actually teach the boys how to","ep081"
"42650",963,"fish here on the property we could teach","ep081"
"42651",966,"them how to fish elsewhere I'm","ep081"
"42652",969,"definitely disappointed that there is","ep081"
"42653",972,"only 10 acres so now they're going to","ep081"
"42654",975,"see a house with twice as much land for","ep081"
"42655",978,"Jason this is a ranch-style house I","ep081"
"42656",981,"really like this","ep081"
"42657",984,"[Music]","ep081"
"42658",987,"what do you like to do outside back","ep081"
"42659",990,"flipping off trees Jason and Donna want","ep081"
"42660",993,"to raise their sons out in the country","ep081"
"42661",996,"and are searching eastern Kansas for a","ep081"
"42662",999,"house with acreage they have a budget of","ep081"
"42663",1002,"$500,000 but can't agree on what they","ep081"
"42664",1005,"want so far they've seen a dated","ep081"
"42665",1008,"farmhouse on 20 acres of land with","ep081"
"42666",1011,"enough projects to keep Jason busy for","ep081"
"42667",1014,"years","ep081"
"42668",1017,"then they saw an updated ranch exactly","ep081"
"42669",1020,"what Donna wants but it was on ten acres","ep081"
"42670",1023,"smaller than what Jason likes so now","ep081"
"42671",1026,"they're going to see a house on a much","ep081"
"42672",1029,"bigger lot this is a ranch-style house I","ep081"
"42673",1032,"really like this it's three bedrooms two","ep081"
"42674",1035,"bathrooms 104 well let's take a look","ep081"
"42675",1038,"because there's been some renovations","ep081"
"42676",1041,"and some addition so we're really","ep081"
"42677",1044,"looking at more like 4,000 square feet","ep081"
"42678",1047,"so you might be able to find someplace","ep081"
"42679",1050,"to expand listed at 405 all right price","ep081"
"42680",1053,"is right in there yes I think you'll","ep081"
"42681",1056,"like the fact that this is sitting on 21","ep081"
"42682",1059,"acres Wow yeah you love that yes so","ep081"
"42683",1062,"there might be some opportunity for you","ep081"
"42684",1065,"to do some expansion in the home and I","ep081"
"42685",1068,"know how you guys like projects all","ep081"
"42686",1071,"right structuring built on I know Donna","ep081"
"42687",1074,"thinks that 20 acres plus is too much","ep081"
"42688",1077,"land for her but I think that we could","ep081"
"42689",1080,"use it for a lot of different activities","ep081"
"42690",1083,"that the family could enjoy in in the","ep081"
"42691",1086,"future what do you think about these","ep081"
"42692",1089,"hardwood floors","ep081"
"42693",1092,"nothing is nice it's light and bright I","ep081"
"42694",1095,"think it can be a little bit darker","ep081"
"42695",1098,"that'd be something you could do Jason","ep081"
"42696",1101,"no project number one got a beautiful","ep081"
"42697",1104,"fireplace","ep081"
"42698",1107,"place it has some detail which I like so","ep081"
"42699",1110,"that's nice let's go take a look at the","ep081"
"42700",1113,"rest of house Wow here's your kitchen","ep081"
"42701",1116,"and your eatin dining area kind of small","ep081"
"42702",1119,"dining room I really wanted a large","ep081"
"42703",1122,"kitchen with an island you can't fit one","ep081"
"42704",1125,"but it's a little tight in the middle I","ep081"
"42705",1128,"would love if the cabinets were white","ep081"
"42706",1131,"and it would be light and bright maybe","ep081"
"42707",1134,"we could actually just stain them or it","ep081"
"42708",1137,"could be moving ready they move on to an","ep081"
"42709",1140,"addition that's off the kitchen I would","ep081"
"42710",1143,"kind of call this maybe like the family","ep081"
"42711",1146,"room okay great what do you think about","ep081"
"42712",1149,"this higher ceiling in this room don't","ep081"
"42713",1152,"really like it they're not really","ep081"
"42714",1155,"energy-efficient and I think it's really","ep081"
"42715",1158,"wasted space only my husband would not","ep081"
"42716",1161,"like vaulted ceilings he's crazy it's","ep081"
"42717",1164,"only a few dollars extra per month and","ep081"
"42718",1167,"it's so much lighter and brighter maybe","ep081"
"42719",1170,"do something with the wall you want to","ep081"
"42720",1173,"open it up a little bit up a little","ep081"
"42721",1176,"right that's nice and pretty good shape","ep081"
"42722",1179,"is this the main bathroom this is your a","ep081"
"42723",1182,"full bath on this end of the hall okay I","ep081"
"42724",1185,"hate that there is no dedicated master","ep081"
"42725",1188,"bathroom we would be sharing with the","ep081"
"42726",1191,"guests and the kids then that would be","ep081"
"42727",1194,"correct","ep081"
"42728",1197,"yeah this would definitely need to be","ep081"
"42729",1200,"renovated so this is the master bedroom","ep081"
"42730",1203,"of the home mm-hmm I don't know if this","ep081"
"42731",1206,"is a good size I don't think all of our","ep081"
"42732",1209,"furniture would even fit in here I mean","ep081"
"42733",1212,"we have our 21 acres here right maybe if","ep081"
"42734",1215,"you could see yourself you know bumping","ep081"
"42735",1218,"the walls out to add on you know a","ep081"
"42736",1221,"master bathroom the costs are starting","ep081"
"42737",1224,"to add up though we'd have to see what","ep081"
"42738",1227,"we can do they go down the hall to look","ep081"
"42739",1230,"at two more bedrooms it has the carpet","ep081"
"42740",1233,"in here yeah we would have to pull that","ep081"
"42741",1236,"out add that to the list of projects","ep081"
"42742",1239,"Rhonda must have been thinking about me","ep081"
"42743",1242,"when she found this house I could see a","ep081"
"42744",1245,"lot of renovations turn into a lot of","ep081"
"42745",1248,"family time so this is the basement I","ep081"
"42746",1251,"really don't know what we would do down","ep081"
"42747",1254,"here I would rather be outside do you","ep081"
"42748",1257,"think you maybe you would use this as","ep081"
"42749",1260,"your art studio there's not a lot of","ep081"
"42750",1263,"natural light though which I really","ep081"
"42751",1266,"would like next they head outside wow I","ep081"
"42752",1269,"love the deck I see that there was","ep081"
"42753",1272,"Meadows yeah I was about to say that I","ep081"
"42754",1275,"not a big fan of all the hills that's","ep081"
"42755",1278,"not really even I kind of like it I'm","ep081"
"42756",1281,"not a big fan of the pond the boys and","ep081"
"42757",1284,"the dog would possibly be in there","ep081"
"42758",1287,"I disagree so there are some","ep081"
"42759",1290,"outbuildings on the property","ep081"
"42760",1293,"what would you guys use these buildings","ep081"
"42761",1296,"for workshop we could probably convert","ep081"
"42762",1299,"this over into it looks like it has","ep081"
"42763",1302,"power that's great","ep081"
"42764",1305,"maybe storage really house for the boys","ep081"
"42765",1308,"[Applause]","ep081"
"42766",1311,"[Music]","ep081"
"42767",1314,"I like the land a lot we're gonna be","ep081"
"42768",1317,"able to do a lot with it the size of the","ep081"
"42769",1320,"house is pretty good I don't like that","ep081"
"42770",1323,"the kitchen is really small and it","ep081"
"42771",1326,"doesn't have a very good workable island","ep081"
"42772",1329,"the outbuildings the the barn we could","ep081"
"42773",1332,"possibly do a workshop it doesn't have","ep081"
"42774",1335,"an art space though for a dedicated","ep081"
"42775",1338,"painting area for me only the basement","ep081"
"42776",1341,"and there's not a lot of natural light","ep081"
"42777",1344,"down there","ep081"
"42778",1347,"I mean with 21 acres you could probably","ep081"
"42779",1350,"build something very easily half there","ep081"
"42780",1353,"and like on the projects Mariano","ep081"
"42781",1356,"now it's time to decide what's more","ep081"
"42782",1359,"important choosing a house that's","ep081"
"42783",1362,"move-in ready has space for an art","ep081"
"42784",1365,"studio or has a lot of land have you","ep081"
"42785",1368,"thought any more about which house","ep081"
"42786",1371,"you're considering","ep081"
"42787",1374,"[Music]","ep081"
"42788",1377,"working with a budget of $500,000 Jason","ep081"
"42789",1380,"and Donna have been searching the","ep081"
"42790",1383,"country areas of eastern Kansas for a","ep081"
"42791",1386,"house with a lot of land having seen","ep081"
"42792",1389,"several homes they're meeting up with","ep081"
"42793",1392,"their agent Rhonda to decide which one","ep081"
"42794",1395,"is right for their family tell me about","ep081"
"42795",1398,"the 1940s farmhouse priced at 475 the","ep081"
"42796",1401,"1940s farmhouse was more towards the","ep081"
"42797",1404,"Craftsman style that I was looking for","ep081"
"42798",1407,"and I'm so happy that that one does not","ep081"
"42799",1410,"have a pond on it but the water source","ep081"
"42800",1413,"is something that I really want the","ep081"
"42801",1416,"workshop was very big I had a nice","ep081"
"42802",1419,"sunroom that I could use for an art","ep081"
"42803",1422,"studio in the future you know there'll","ep081"
"42804",1425,"be lots of projects at that house it's","ep081"
"42805",1428,"not moving ready you would have your","ep081"
"42806",1431,"work cut out for you I'm not sure if I","ep081"
"42807",1434,"want to deal with all that it would take","ep081"
"42808",1437,"a lot of time what about the ranch that","ep081"
"42809",1440,"was on ten acres priced at five ten but","ep081"
"42810",1443,"move-in ready for you Donna with move-in","ep081"
"42811",1446,"ready comes over budget it did have a","ep081"
"42812",1449,"really nice workshop for projects that","ep081"
"42813",1452,"don't really exist the main areas of the","ep081"
"42814",1455,"house had a lot of natural light with","ep081"
"42815",1458,"all of the windows a basement it was a","ep081"
"42816",1461,"good amount of space for me to do art","ep081"
"42817",1464,"down there the ten acres we could use a","ep081"
"42818",1467,"little bit more had a giant pond right","ep081"
"42819",1470,"out the back door","ep081"
"42820",1473,"it did and that's just not safe for the","ep081"
"42821",1476,"kids at all they do know how to swim","ep081"
"42822",1479,"still what would you think of the ranch","ep081"
"42823",1482,"with over 20 acres and it was priced","ep081"
"42824",1485,"right at 405 it had an awesome workshop","ep081"
"42825",1488,"the kitchen was a little small and it","ep081"
"42826",1491,"was very dated the land though was","ep081"
"42827",1494,"really nice the water source with the","ep081"
"42828",1497,"pond my art studio was missing except","ep081"
"42829",1500,"for the basement there was no light down","ep081"
"42830",1503,"there that house had a great family room","ep081"
"42831",1506,"that was a nice room and had a lot of","ep081"
"42832",1509,"windows and a lot of light we've","ep081"
"42833",1512,"probably had to add an addition for the","ep081"
"42834",1515,"master bedroom it had a really small","ep081"
"42835",1518,"master we'd be able to tackle it and","ep081"
"42836",1521,"keep it within budget I mean lots of","ep081"
"42837",1524,"projects also","ep081"
"42838",1527,"[Music]","ep081"
"42839",1530,"the farmhouse yes it needed a lot of","ep081"
"42840",1533,"work but the farmhouse had nice interest","ep081"
"42841",1536,"in details that I really liked it has a","ep081"
"42842",1539,"space for my art studio away from the","ep081"
"42843",1542,"boys and everyone I think that would be","ep081"
"42844",1545,"fantastic and there's no pond we bought","ep081"
"42845",1548,"the house three weeks ago and a week ago","ep081"
"42846",1551,"we started moving our things in and we","ep081"

"43011",423,"the fact that all the square footage is","ep082"
"43012",426,"on one floor a 2-story home is important","ep082"
"43013",429,"to me because I do like having the","ep082"
"43014",432,"ability to separate the day-to-day","ep082"
"43015",435,"living area versus where we sleep","ep082"

"43118",744,"in style I would like a two-story home","ep082"
"43119",747,"because I like the separation between","ep082"
"43120",750,"day-to-day living space as well as where","ep082"
"43121",753,"we go to bed that's a key component for","ep082"
"43122",756,"me 2,500 square feet listed only at 995","ep082"
"43123",759,"thousand dollars I do like that let's go","ep082"
"43124",762,"take a look at the house right oh we","ep082"

"43136",798,"quite large and open I like the layout","ep082"
"43137",801,"yeah this has a lot of character and it","ep082"
"43138",804,"actually has a ranch-style feel I do","ep082"
"43139",807,"wish we had the separation though let's","ep082"
"43140",810,"take a peek at the yard oh it spans the","ep082"
"43141",813,"entire length of the property the","ep082"
"43142",816,"backyard had no view and that was a bit","ep082"
"43143",819,"of a turn-off oh there's no pool","ep082"
"43144",822,"no pool remember we can always get a","ep082"
"43145",825,"kiddy pool well for me or for Saira for","ep082"

"43298",1284,"overall I do like this house yeah but","ep082"
"43299",1287,"we've keep in mind that we do want to do","ep082"
"43300",1290,"a renovation and that's gonna cost a","ep082"
"43301",1293,"pretty penny and the houses are already","ep082"
"43302",1296,"on the high end of what I'm willing to","ep082"
"43303",1299,"spend at least we can't work around that","ep082"
"43304",1302,"now after three years of hunting they're","ep082"
"43305",1305,"ready to decide and it all comes down to","ep082"

"43321",1353,"the only one out of the three of them","ep082"
"43322",1356,"that face directly to the east","ep082"
"43323",1359,"the view was killer yeah the entryway","ep082"

"44199",978,"this is a big now you're getting stairs","ep084"
"44200",981,"so the only reason","ep084"
"44201",984,"ladders so that you can access this loft","ep084"
"44202",987,"for storage what about another staircase","ep084"
"44203",990,"we can do that but we would be blocking","ep084"
"44204",993,"the entrance into the bathroom is that a","ep084"
"44205",996,"deal-breaker with the ladder it would","ep084"
"44206",999,"just be a little space I won't use if","ep084"
"44207",1002,"you don't need it just hang it here and","ep084"

"44217",1032,"a shower there both within the base","ep084"
"44218",1035,"price the tub is actually a foot longer","ep084"
"44219",1038,"so you'll actually have a wider bathroom","ep084"
"44220",1041,"oh that's good I love it","ep084"

"45515",525,"know it's kind of disappointing the","ep087"

"45527",561,"and it's 350 thousand true you've got a","ep087"
"45528",564,"huge double lot on the corner with 300","ep087"
"45529",567,"plus feet of waterfront look at all this","ep087"
"45530",570,"yard I didn't want too much of a yard to","ep087"
"45531",573,"maintain yeah but these trees are","ep087"
"45532",576,"beautiful and they also drop leaves that","ep087"
"45533",579,"I have to rake up the number-one","ep087"
"45534",582,"priority in this house hunt was the","ep087"
"45535",585,"outdoor living space and I thought it","ep087"
"45536",588,"was exactly what he was looking for I","ep087"
"45537",591,"have to keep him grounded and realistic","ep087"
"45538",594,"[Music]","ep087"
"45539",597,"so tell me some pots that kitchen isn't","ep087"

"45543",609,"you love but this yard is so big is","ep087"
"45544",612,"gonna be so much to maintain as your","ep087"
"45545",615,"girlfriend I don't like that master","ep087"
"45546",618,"suite but as your Realtor I had to show","ep087"
"45547",621,"it to you because it's a great bargain","ep087"
"45548",624,"and under budget","ep087"
"45549",627,"though heather has a house with a more","ep087"
"45550",630,"manageable yard for Paul but there's a","ep087"
"45551",633,"catch it's a little above budget at","ep087"
"45552",636,"450,000","ep087"
"45553",639,"450 is a little bit much for me","ep087"
"45554",642,"[Music]","ep087"
"45555",645,"sunset dinner on the beach this is life","ep087"
"45556",648,"Oh with the help of his agent and","ep087"
"45557",651,"girlfriend Heather is determined to find","ep087"
"45558",654,"a home in Panama City Florida where they","ep087"
"45559",657,"can both be happy they hope to find a","ep087"
"45560",660,"waterfront home with a chef's kitchen","ep087"
"45561",663,"and enough space for their blended","ep087"
"45562",666,"family a tough ask within Paul's four","ep087"
"45563",669,"hundred and twenty five thousand dollar","ep087"
"45564",672,"budget finding the true Craftsman style","ep087"
"45565",675,"home that Paul wants has also proven","ep087"
"45566",678,"difficult so far they saw a ranch-style","ep087"
"45567",681,"home on the water","ep087"
"45568",684,"with a large kitchen and some of the","ep087"
"45569",687,"craftsman character Paul wants but the","ep087"
"45570",690,"master suite left a lot to be desired","ep087"
"45571",693,"and the yard would require a lot of","ep087"
"45572",696,"maintenance so now Heather is found a","ep087"
"45573",699,"contemporary style home with an outdoor","ep087"
"45574",702,"space that's sure to impress Paul I love","ep087"

"45583",729,"budget which I'm not too happy about or","ep087"
"45584",732,"50s a little bit much for me okay so I","ep087"

"45641",903,"more like a loft to me just because","ep087"
"45642",906,"there's no door and the section missing","ep087"
"45643",909,"out of the wall it is an open concept","ep087"
"45644",912,"isn't it it's very open the closets make","ep087"
"45645",915,"this a third bedroom oh okay still kind","ep087"
"45646",918,"of strange in my opinion a bedroom has","ep087"

"45658",954,"the loft is a big - I thought it was","ep087"
"45659",957,"three bedrooms you can really","ep087"
"45660",960,"accommodate all the kids here though","ep087"
"45661",963,"Heather finds a home that has more room","ep087"
"45662",966,"for the kids but do you think about the","ep087"
"45663",969,"house kind of disappointed that it's not","ep087"
"45664",972,"a craftsman-style house","ep087"
"45665",975,"[Music]","ep087"
"45666",978,"love this speech Paul has a maximum","ep087"
"45667",981,"budget of 425 thousand dollars to find a","ep087"
"45668",984,"home with waterfront access for himself","ep087"
"45669",987,"and his girlfriend / agent Heather in","ep087"
"45670",990,"Panama City Florida so far they've seen","ep087"
"45671",993,"a house with great indoor space but an","ep087"
"45672",996,"outdoor area that fell short and another","ep087"
"45673",999,"with great outdoor amenities but the","ep087"
"45674",1002,"layout didn't work for their blended","ep087"
"45675",1005,"family we have here the four-bed","ep087"
"45676",1008,"three-bath 2,100 square feet and there's","ep087"
"45677",1011,"plenty of room for the kids what do you","ep087"
"45678",1014,"think about the house kind of","ep087"
"45679",1017,"disappointed it's not a craftsman-style","ep087"
"45680",1020,"house like I really wanted I know Paul","ep087"
"45681",1023,"would love to find a craftsman but he","ep087"
"45682",1026,"may just have to settle for a few","ep087"
"45683",1029,"craftsman details and I'm gonna rule","ep087"
"45684",1032,"this point in because there's no","ep087"
"45685",1035,"wraparound porch and I just wanted to","ep087"
"45686",1038,"let you know it's 425 all right I do","ep087"
"45687",1041,"like the Craftsman style door hardwood","ep087"
"45688",1044,"door like that but it has stairs and I","ep087"
"45689",1047,"wasn't looking for that oh you like the","ep087"
"45690",1050,"stairs yeah and I wanted hardwood floors","ep087"
"45691",1053,"would have been ideal for me I mean this","ep087"
"45692",1056,"tile looks actually pretty nice but my","ep087"
"45693",1059,"preference is hardwood flooring it's got","ep087"
"45694",1062,"an interesting design so you've got a","ep087"
"45695",1065,"living room this is actually quite a big","ep087"
"45696",1068,"room when I soap in windows to the","ep087"
"45697",1071,"outside I like that mm-hmm","ep087"
"45698",1074,"there's no crown molding here yeah the","ep087"
"45699",1077,"crown molding to me adds to the charm of","ep087"
"45700",1080,"the house it's got a classic look okay","ep087"
"45701",1083,"looks like we've got our dining room","ep087"
"45702",1086,"right over here it almost looks like","ep087"
"45703",1089,"they wanted to open it but yet not open","ep087"

"45705",1095,"attempt to update it what's the","ep087"
"45706",1098,"dining-room lamp Hey","ep087"
"45707",1101,"it's dangling almost all the way to the","ep087"
"45708",1104,"floor well come on in here so you've got","ep087"
"45709",1107,"your chef's kitchen I wouldn't call it a","ep087"
"45710",1110,"chef's kitchen really you've got your","ep087"
"45711",1113,"stainless-steel appliances here I have","ep087"
"45712",1116,"pots that are higher than this","ep087"
"45713",1119,"there's a nice island here and there's","ep087"
"45714",1122,"granite countertop this could be the","ep087"
"45715",1125,"family room look the fireplace it feels","ep087"
"45716",1128,"a little tight in here though just","ep087"
"45717",1131,"because this there's that second-story","ep087"
"45718",1134,"but this this is why I brought you so","ep087"

"45726",1158,"where I could do some grilling okay I","ep087"
"45727",1161,"want to check out the dock to look at","ep087"
"45728",1164,"that canal that's a lot of space right","ep087"
"45729",1167,"on the water you have a hundred and","ep087"
"45730",1170,"twenty-five feet waterfront","ep087"
"45731",1173,"I see why is 425 now the view alone is","ep087"
"45732",1176,"worth 40 points absolutely they head","ep087"
"45733",1179,"back inside to see a guest bedroom then","ep087"
"45734",1182,"go upstairs to see two more guest","ep087"
"45735",1185,"bedrooms and a guest bathroom oh this is","ep087"
"45736",1188,"a really nice bathroom this kind of","ep087"
"45737",1191,"reminds me of the Craftsman style that I","ep087"
"45738",1194,"wanted oh yeah shaving is amazing and","ep087"
"45739",1197,"you've got nice countertops two sinks","ep087"

"46260",1248,"that all the bedrooms were on the same","ep088"
"46261",1251,"floor I don't like the fact that there's","ep088"
"46262",1254,"no place for a urinal it's over budget","ep088"
"46263",1257,"so there's not a ton of room really to","ep088"
"46264",1260,"do any projects now it's time to choose","ep088"
"46265",1263,"since Matt and Chrissy don't agree on","ep088"
"46266",1266,"much it may come down to office space","ep088"
"46267",1269,"open concept and price we really ought","ep088"
"46268",1272,"to make a distance among","ep088"

"46275",1293,"1978 cottage at the land that was within","ep088"
"46276",1296,"my budget at four hundred and seventy","ep088"
"46277",1299,"nine thousand nine hundred dollars but","ep088"
"46278",1302,"it's over yours I do love the fact that","ep088"
"46279",1305,"it's move-in ready","ep088"
"46280",1308,"it is the house that is the most amount","ep088"
"46281",1311,"of land that's awesome for me awesome","ep088"
"46282",1314,"for you and you loved the kitchen right","ep088"
"46283",1317,"that bonus space is perfect for the kids","ep088"
"46284",1320,"I didn't like that the bedrooms were not","ep088"
"46285",1323,"on the same floor and we would have to","ep088"
"46286",1326,"turn one of the bedrooms into an office","ep088"
"46287",1329,"space so that makes working from home","ep088"
"46288",1332,"well ruff what do you thing about that","ep088"
"46289",1335,"1957 dated ranch well within both of our","ep088"
"46290",1338,"budgets at three hundred ninety nine","ep088"
"46291",1341,"thousand nine hundred","ep088"
"46292",1344,"that it's a ranch it does have four","ep088"
"46293",1347,"bedrooms and three baths one bedroom is","ep088"
"46294",1350,"on the lower level in the finished","ep088"
"46295",1353,"basement right however if I gave up the","ep088"
"46296",1356,"office space we could make all four","ep088"
"46297",1359,"bedrooms be on the same floor there is a","ep088"
"46298",1362,"perfect spot for my urinal but it is","ep088"
"46299",1365,"under half an acre of land which is even","ep088"
"46300",1368,"more reason why I love it the thing that","ep088"
"46301",1371,"I love most about the dated ranch is","ep088"
"46302",1374,"that it's a major fixer and I know you","ep088"
"46303",1377,"don't want to do a lot of work I don't","ep088"

"46305",1383,"renovated colonial I mean it was the","ep088"

"46313",1407,"the urinal in the house it's the most","ep088"
"46314",1410,"expensive house we looked at that's","ep088"

"46440",267,"there's at least a fireplace there right","ep089"
"46441",270,"it doesn't look to be wood-burning I","ep089"
"46442",273,"think it's gas Chicago gets very cold in","ep089"
"46443",276,"the winter and it would be great to just","ep089"
"46444",279,"be able to get home from work set a fire","ep089"

"46473",366,"place what's that Joyce so that's the L","ep089"
"46474",369,"okay we're unfortunately backed up to","ep089"
"46475",372,"the L on this property and that's","ep089"
"46476",375,"probably why it's three hundred and","ep089"
"46477",378,"forty thousand dollars that's low in","ep089"
"46478",381,"this neighborhood I'm guessing it for","ep089"
"46479",384,"some work that needs to be there's gonna","ep089"
"46480",387,"be some work but I mean the Showell is","ep089"

"46483",396,"here we go you got your 10-foot ceilings","ep089"
"46484",399,"I love the ceilings good 14 inch massive","ep089"
"46485",402,"baseboards yeah those baseboards are","ep089"
"46486",405,"really cool do you think they're","ep089"
"46487",408,"original I do you can tell by how many","ep089"
"46488",411,"layers of paint on them the floors I'm","ep089"
"46489",414,"not so sure I don't think these are","ep089"
"46490",417,"original","ep089"
"46491",420,"I would actually rip all this up okay","ep089"
"46492",423,"continue the hardwood down the hall and","ep089"
"46493",426,"into both bedrooms how much would you","ep089"
"46494",429,"put on sticker price for that around","ep089"
"46495",432,"$10,000 for the whole apartment yeah","ep089"
"46496",435,"okay but again we're at $340,000 way","ep089"
"46497",438,"under your budget what do you think","ep089"
"46498",441,"about these","ep089"
"46499",444,"pocket doors here you know I really like","ep089"
"46500",447,"them it kind of keeps with the history","ep089"
"46501",450,"of the place so you're gonna hate me for","ep089"
"46502",453,"this but I would say actually rip this","ep089"
"46503",456,"entire wall out why you get a lot more","ep089"
"46504",459,"that natural light pouring into the back","ep089"
"46505",462,"of this room I'd be really sad to lose","ep089"
"46506",465,"this frame something like that is what","ep089"
"46507",468,"makes this place so cool I love the","ep089"
"46508",471,"fireplace look at these great windows it","ep089"
"46509",474,"adds so much character and also a ton of","ep089"
"46510",477,"light and I also love the ivy creeping","ep089"
"46511",480,"up through that window you feel like","ep089"
"46512",483,"you're in the trees so what's nice is","ep089"
"46513",486,"this property you have only two bedrooms","ep089"
"46514",489,"one bathroom but you have this really","ep089"
"46515",492,"cool little nook that I think you can","ep089"
"46516",495,"use as a great office space yeah this is","ep089"
"46517",498,"a great little space so let's take a","ep089"
"46518",501,"look at the master bed here okay","ep089"
"46519",504,"you got two large windows but we're","ep089"
"46520",507,"looking at a brick wall","ep089"
"46521",510,"um this is tight well it's vintage","ep089"
"46522",513,"fortunately this closet for vintage is","ep089"
"46523",516,"fairly large yeah this isn't bad oh my","ep089"
"46524",519,"gosh the Claude foot bathtub yeah do you","ep089"
"46525",522,"also see how much space is taking up in","ep089"
"46526",525,"here you also want a two bath and this","ep089"
"46527",528,"is your only bathroom in this home and","ep089"
"46528",531,"it's taken over by this clawfoot tub I","ep089"
"46529",534,"say it has to go the vanity is terrible","ep089"
"46530",537,"the tile also is horrendous this this","ep089"
"46531",540,"room requires a lot of work but I still","ep089"
"46532",543,"think there's room here to keep the tub","ep089"
"46533",546,"alright so there's good news and bad","ep089"
"46534",549,"news","ep089"
"46535",552,"goodness it's a vintage building with","ep089"
"46536",555,"essential air bad news is you don't have","ep089"
"46537",558,"any unit washer and dryer okay I mean","ep089"
"46538",561,"that's disappointing in my price range I","ep089"
"46539",564,"kind of expect to have an in unit","ep089"
"46540",567,"washer/dryer so luckily we have a lot of","ep089"
"46541",570,"space here for it I would say you're","ep089"
"46542",573,"probably gonna be looking at 35 to","ep089"
"46543",576,"$4,000 but it can be done okay","ep089"
"46544",579,"so the costs are continuing to pile up","ep089"
"46545",582,"in this place that's best vintage right","ep089"
"46546",585,"so it looks like they recently did the","ep089"
"46547",588,"kitchen okay if I was designing your","ep089"
"46548",591,"kitchen I would ever choose dark granite","ep089"
"46549",594,"I think there's a few cleanup items that","ep089"
"46550",597,"would look great fast and easy adding a","ep089"
"46551",600,"backsplash changing the handles I just","ep089"
"46552",603,"don't think it immediately needs a full","ep089"
"46553",606,"renovation they see the second bedroom","ep089"
"46554",609,"then head out back","ep089"
"46555",612,"oh my god this is loud it's loud you're","ep089"
"46556",615,"right on the tracks here so the good","ep089"
"46557",618,"thing is this is a huge deck space yeah","ep089"
"46558",621,"I can see the potential obviously the","ep089"
"46559",624,"Train is a big con so we can never get","ep089"
"46560",627,"rid of this train noise and the future","ep089"
"46561",630,"buyer is always going to hear that this","ep089"
"46562",633,"is - let's go inside there's some clear","ep089"
"46563",636,"pros I love the vintage charm the","ep089"
"46564",639,"fireplace the clawfoot tub the high","ep089"
"46565",642,"ceilings and then also this is my ideal","ep089"
"46566",645,"location the cons are kind of obvious","ep089"
"46567",648,"there's only one bathroom a small master","ep089"
"46568",651,"bedroom and obviously the train going","ep089"
"46569",654,"past all the time kinda kills the","ep089"
"46570",657,"relaxation behind that outdoor space the","ep089"
"46571",660,"bones of this place are amazing as","ep089"
"46572",663,"Timmy's Realtor and friend I'm","ep089"
"46573",666,"encouraging to buy a fixer-upper because","ep089"
"46574",669,"I want him to gain equity I just am not","ep089"
"46575",672,"sure if I want to take on that big of a","ep089"
"46576",675,"renovation at this time of my life so","ep089"
"46577",678,"james lines up the move-in ready place","ep089"
"46578",681,"Timmy wants but that comes at a cost","ep089"
"46579",684,"it's getting more near the top of my","ep089"
"46580",687,"budget so I'm hoping there's not too","ep089"
"46581",690,"much work to be done","ep089"
"46582",693,"[Music]","ep089"
"46583",696,"[Applause]","ep089"
"46584",699,"Chicago attorney Timmy is buying his","ep089"
"46585",702,"first home and he's turned to his friend","ep089"
"46586",705,"and broker James for help real estate to","ep089"
"46587",708,"me is really interesting every day is","ep089"
"46588",711,"different you know I work with all","ep089"
"46589",714,"different clients some good some bad","ep089"
"46590",717,"luckily Timmy's a good one help I'm the","ep089"
"46591",720,"good one working with four hundred and","ep089"
"46592",723,"fifty thousand dollars they've seen a","ep089"
"46593",726,"walk up with a vintage charm Timmy wants","ep089"
"46594",729,"in Lincoln Park but it needed a lot of","ep089"
"46595",732,"work so today James has lined up a","ep089"
"46596",735,"move-in-ready mid-rise we're in the","ep089"
"46597",738,"heart of River West right now walking","ep089"
"46598",741,"distance to downtown to your office okay","ep089"
"46599",744,"the elves right here yeah this is","ep089"
"46600",747,"actually the first-ever neighborhood I","ep089"
"46601",750,"lived in Chicago so it's a special area","ep089"
"46602",753,"to me what do you think of the exterior","ep089"
"46603",756,"there's no charm yes right it's a little","ep089"
"46604",759,"sterile for you but it's a two-bedroom","ep089"
"46605",762,"two-bath its $425,000 $425,000 is","ep089"
"46606",765,"getting more near the top of my budget","ep089"
"46607",768,"so I'm hoping there's not too much work","ep089"
"46608",771,"to be done it really only needs cosmetic","ep089"
"46609",774,"work okay so this is obviously not","ep089"
"46610",777,"vintage but I'm gonna show you why I","ep089"
"46611",780,"brought you here okay take a right right","ep089"
"46612",783,"here wow this is a spectacular view","ep089"
"46613",786,"great when you walk in you have the","ep089"
"46614",789,"entire Chicago skyline right in front of","ep089"
"46615",792,"you the floor-to-ceiling windows give it","ep089"
"46616",795,"so much natural light in here yep and","ep089"
"46617",798,"even better we won't go up there today","ep089"
"46618",801,"because it's raining but you have a","ep089"
"46619",804,"common roof deck that the building","ep089"
"46620",807,"shares that's pretty cool but I see a","ep089"
"46621",810,"private balcony which kind of feels like","ep089"
"46622",813,"a build out of the whole living room so","ep089"
"46623",816,"what do you think of this great room","ep089"
"46624",819,"kind of feel space you know one thing I","ep089"
"46625",822,"noticed right away is there's no real","ep089"
"46626",825,"hardwood floors you're right this is a","ep089"
"46627",828,"laminate floor you're looking at about","ep089"
"46628",831,"10 to 12 thousand dollars to add","ep089"
"46629",834,"hardwood to the entire units so a pretty","ep089"
"46630",837,"penny in the first project yes another","ep089"
"46631",840,"thing I noticed is there's no fireplace","ep089"
"46632",843,"but the wow factor in this room is","ep089"
"46633",846,"definitely the views I just don't think","ep089"
"46634",849,"there's anything that compares to the","ep089"
"46635",852,"Chicago skyline what do you think about","ep089"
"46636",855,"the finishes in here well I like that","ep089"
"46637",858,"the kitchen is kind of part of the","ep089"
"46638",861,"living room that's great for hosting it","ep089"
"46639",864,"just reminds me of one of these nicer","ep089"
"46640",867,"rental buildings I've lived in in law","ep089"
"46641",870,"school and","ep089"
"46642",873,"I'm not a fan you're looking at around","ep089"
"46643",876,"$14,000 for full cosmetic and appliance","ep089"
"46644",879,"update in the kitchen the place is","ep089"
"46645",882,"already $425,000 so I don't have as much","ep089"
"46646",885,"wiggle room right to spend on renovation","ep089"
"46647",888,"right I would suggest you do the floors","ep089"
"46648",891,"first and then you can live with this","ep089"
"46649",894,"for a little bit and update as you go on","ep089"
"46650",897,"down the hall they see a full guest bath","ep089"
"46651",900,"it's great to have someplace that guests","ep089"
"46652",903,"can use that's not in my bedroom and","ep089"
"46653",906,"then right here to the right we have the","ep089"
"46654",909,"full-size stackable washer and dryer","ep089"
"46655",912,"great I'm glad that this isn't a project","ep089"
"46656",915,"that I'd have to do so here's the second","ep089"
"46657",918,"bedroom what do you think yeah I mean","ep089"
"46658",921,"it's solid I didn't see a designated","ep089"
"46659",924,"office space in the living room so I","ep089"
"46660",927,"think I need to add a desk in here I","ep089"
"46661",930,"mean it's not the cool","ep089"
"46662",933,"office space yet I am looking for but","ep089"
"46663",936,"it's very functional okay so huge master","ep089"
"46664",939,"bedroom plenty of room for a king-size","ep089"
"46665",942,"bed what do you think I mean these","ep089"
"46666",945,"windows are great this whole unit is","ep089"
"46667",948,"using great windows for natural light","ep089"
"46668",951,"and take a look in there oh yeah this is","ep089"
"46669",954,"a big place this is a big walk-in closet","ep089"
"46670",957,"I have a good amount of clothes and I","ep089"
"46671",960,"can easily fill this closet he's never","ep089"
"46672",963,"gonna find enough storage space or","ep089"
"46673",966,"closet space in a vintage building this","ep089"
"46674",969,"is perfect for him and here you go your","ep089"
"46675",972,"massive full-size on Swedes it would be","ep089"
"46676",975,"cool if we did a clawfoot tub here that","ep089"
"46677",978,"would be an excellent space for it very","ep089"
"46678",981,"much in renovation though it feels a","ep089"
"46679",984,"little more than cosmetic yeah but not","ep089"
"46680",987,"right away and it really truly is","ep089"

"46684",999,"that there was an outdoor space that was","ep089"
"46685",1002,"private was enough for me the ceilings","ep089"
"46686",1005,"are very high the in unit washer and","ep089"
"46687",1008,"dryer was great and it was two beds in","ep089"
"46688",1011,"two full baths I know that it's still","ep089"
"46689",1014,"within my budget but we talked about a","ep089"
"46690",1017,"lot of projects that weren't she a","ep089"
"46691",1020,"concern is when I do all of that I still","ep089"
"46692",1023,"won't feel the charm","ep089"
"46693",1026,"it still doesn't really jive with what I","ep089"
"46694",1029,"wanted going into this process which is","ep089"
"46695",1032,"a cool vintage place to make my own","ep089"

"46709",1074,"move-in-ready mid-rise that was a bit","ep089"
"46710",1077,"too contemporary for his taste so today","ep089"
"46711",1080,"James has found a turnkey vintage place","ep089"
"46712",1083,"but it's in Rogers Park seven miles","ep089"

"46714",1089,"trip James but we are so far north but","ep089"
"46715",1092,"there's something really special about","ep089"
"46716",1095,"this area is that you actually have","ep089"
"46717",1098,"condo buildings that are built on the","ep089"
"46718",1101,"lake the view is incredible something","ep089"
"46719",1104,"like this in Lincoln Park","ep089"

"46721",1110,"Rodgers Park was a wild card when I","ep089"
"46722",1113,"brought to me here but I want to open","ep089"
"46723",1116,"his mind a little bit and kind of give","ep089"
"46724",1119,"him some ideas outside the box the curb","ep089"
"46725",1122,"appeal of the building is great it was","ep089"
"46726",1125,"built in the 20s and you wouldn't","ep089"
"46727",1128,"believe the price for something like","ep089"
"46728",1131,"this it's three hundred and seventy-nine","ep089"
"46729",1134,"thousand okay","ep089"
"46730",1137,"I'm interested to see it alright so","ep089"

"46733",1146,"are pretty high and it for a vintage","ep089"
"46734",1149,"it's real bright I think part of what's","ep089"
"46735",1152,"throwing me off initially are the color","ep089"
"46736",1155,"tones okay this wall has texture too to","ep089"
"46737",1158,"it I'm not a fan of that either","ep089"
"46738",1161,"for 379 these are just cosmetic fixes","ep089"
"46739",1164,"and that's something we can easily do","ep089"
"46740",1167,"after we close I like that there's a","ep089"
"46741",1170,"fireplace it's a gas fireplace what do","ep089"
"46742",1173,"you think of the floors the floors are","ep089"
"46743",1176,"really nice and what's nice here you","ep089"
"46744",1179,"have a little nook that you can use for","ep089"
"46745",1182,"your office again that is nice I like","ep089"
"46746",1185,"that that's near the window so you have","ep089"
"46747",1188,"sensual AC and then you have the radiant","ep089"
"46748",1191,"heat in the winters okay","ep089"
"46749",1194,"I actually I like the look of the","ep089"
"46750",1197,"radiator that's one of the vintage","ep089"
"46751",1200,"touches in here that I actually like","ep089"
"46752",1203,"alright let's take a look at the second","ep089"
"46753",1206,"bedroom great let's do it","ep089"

"46757",1218,"a solid second bedroom they see a full","ep089"
"46758",1221,"guest bath that's really convenient in","ep089"
"46759",1224,"case I do have guests","ep089"
"46760",1227,"then head to the kitchen never my","ep089"
"46761",1230,"favorite but the finishes again are real","ep089"
"46762",1233,"nice it's been recently updated new","ep089"
"46763",1236,"stainless-steel appliances I don't love","ep089"
"46764",1239,"the color tone of the cabinets easy","ep089"
"46765",1242,"paint then maybe even like a subway tile","ep089"
"46766",1245,"backsplash yeah","ep089"
"46767",1248,"so this master bedroom is amazing it's","ep089"
"46768",1251,"huge and you have the best views in the","ep089"
"46769",1254,"house every morning you the thought of","ep089"
"46770",1257,"waking up to that view every morning is","ep089"
"46771",1260,"incredible you don't have a huge closet","ep089"
"46772",1263,"over here but what I'm really excited to","ep089"
"46773",1266,"show you though is once you take a look","ep089"
"46774",1269,"in here oh there we go","ep089"
"46775",1272,"full-size side-by-side washer/dryer you","ep089"
"46776",1275,"never see that this is great that this","ep089"
"46777",1278,"is a project that I wouldn't have to do","ep089"
"46778",1281,"this is a second full sized bathroom","ep089"
"46779",1284,"nice size bright I mean once again the","ep089"
"46780",1287,"style wouldn't be mine I think a log","ep089"
"46781",1290,"Cherie clawfoot tub would look great","ep089"
"46782",1293,"over there I'm hoping he's gonna let me","ep089"
"46783",1296,"get my hands dirty on that master bath","ep089"
"46784",1299,"it's got a little bit generic tile in","ep089"
"46785",1302,"there some ceramic and it's an easy","ep089"
"46786",1305,"quick fix and it would make a dramatic","ep089"
"46787",1308,"difference in the unit and again we're","ep089"
"46788",1311,"at $379,000 here to spend other money","ep089"
"46789",1314,"and update the unit doesn't have a","ep089"
"46790",1317,"private outdoor space but there's a","ep089"
"46791",1320,"large shared patio how incredible is","ep089"
"46792",1323,"this this is gorgeous I mean I feel way","ep089"
"46793",1326,"out of the city which is obviously a con","ep089"
"46794",1329,"but to have this private beach area just","ep089"
"46795",1332,"for this community it's so rare and it's","ep089"
"46796",1335,"practically yours practically mine but","ep089"
"46797",1338,"not completely mine right but I can't","ep089"
"46798",1341,"argue with this all right what do you","ep089"
"46799",1344,"think I like the style the building and","ep089"
"46800",1347,"then the views I never imagined that I","ep089"
"46801",1350,"could find a place right on the lake to","ep089"
"46802",1353,"be honest I didn't know what existed in","ep089"
"46803",1356,"Chicago we had a washer and dryer in","ep089"
"46804",1359,"unit a huge master bedroom and all at a","ep089"
"46805",1362,"price point that's still far within my","ep089"
"46806",1365,"budget","ep089"
"46807",1368,"one thing that is gonna be very hard for","ep089"
"46808",1371,"me to get over is the location the rest","ep089"
"46809",1374,"of the country thinks seven miles may","ep089"
"46810",1377,"not be that far away in Chicago that's a","ep089"
"46811",1380,"world away I'm in the suburb up here","ep089"
"46812",1383,"you're technically still in Chicago zip","ep089"
"46813",1386,"code and the owl is just a walk away so","ep089"
"46814",1389,"I think it's a lifestyle he might be","ep089"
"46815",1392,"able to get used to","ep089"
"46816",1395,"if I sleep on it I'll be ready to make a","ep089"
"46817",1398,"decision okay good there's a lot to","ep089"
"46818",1401,"consider but ultimately Timmy may have","ep089"
"46819",1404,"to choose between a home that's move-in","ep089"
"46820",1407,"ready has vintage charm or is in the","ep089"
"46821",1410,"heart of the city I think I'm ready okay","ep089"
"46822",1413,"[Music]","ep089"
"46823",1416,"it's time to make a decision right Timmy","ep089"
"46824",1419,"has four hundred and fifty thousand","ep089"
"46825",1422,"dollars to buy his first place in","ep089"
"46826",1425,"Chicago with the help of real estate","ep089"
"46827",1428,"broker and contractor James he's seen","ep089"
"46828",1431,"both fixer-uppers and move-in-ready","ep089"
"46829",1434,"options now it's decision time","ep089"
"46830",1437,"so the Lincoln Park property is three","ep089"
"46831",1440,"hundred forty thousand dollars this is","ep089"
"46832",1443,"my ideal location the charm was just so","ep089"
"46833",1446,"amazing having a wood-burning fireplace","ep089"
"46834",1449,"was so cool to me but with that level of","ep089"
"46835",1452,"vintage charm comes a smaller master","ep089"
"46836",1455,"bedroom the train noise is a definite","ep089"
"46837",1458,"con and also it would require a lot of","ep089"
"46838",1461,"work the mid rise modern Lauren Ginn","ep089"
"46839",1464,"25,000 it really had no charm but it's","ep089"
"46840",1467,"two-bedroom two-bath and you get tons of","ep089"
"46841",1470,"natural light outdoor space that was","ep089"
"46842",1473,"private the views were amazing yeah","ep089"
"46843",1476,"however there were some pricey","ep089"
"46844",1479,"renovations we discussed now let's talk","ep089"
"46845",1482,"about the wild card property the Rodgers","ep089"
"46846",1485,"Park","ep089"
"46847",1488,"lakefront three hundred seventy nine","ep089"
"46848",1491,"thousand two bedroom two bath I never","ep089"
"46849",1494,"knew that Chicago even had lakefront","ep089"
"46850",1497,"properties like that I did like that it","ep089"
"46851",1500,"was vintage that being said there was no","ep089"
"46852",1503,"private outdoor space but the master","ep089"
"46853",1506,"bedroom was massive the question is if I","ep089"
"46854",1509,"can get over that location it's time to","ep089"
"46855",1512,"make a decision I think I'm ready","ep089"
"46856",1515,"I think it's clear I love the Lincoln","ep089"
"46857",1518,"Park vintage after seeing a few","ep089"
"46858",1521,"different properties it made it clear to","ep089"
"46859",1524,"me that to get the style and decor I","ep089"
"46860",1527,"want in my ideal location I've got to go","ep089"
"46861",1530,"into somewhat of a blank palette I'm a","ep089"
"46862",1533,"little nervous about the renovation I'm","ep089"
"46863",1536,"gonna guide you through it just know","ep089"
"46864",1539,"there's gonna be a lot of stress since","ep089"

"46866",1545,"start knocking stuff down let's get to","ep089"
"46867",1548,"work all right so these are two options","ep089"
"46868",1551,"for subway tile I closed on the property","ep089"
"46869",1554,"six weeks ago and here I am in the","ep089"
"46870",1557,"middle of construction zone the exciting","ep089"
"46871",1560,"part for me is creating this old old","ep089"
"46872",1563,"home into something that fits my","ep089"
"46873",1566,"personality this bathroom has to be","ep089"
"46874",1569,"finished before your lease is up so you","ep089"
"46875",1572,"can move in here this home was","ep089"
"46876",1575,"healthfully within my budget at $340,000","ep089"
"46877",1578,"we ended up paying three hundred","ep089"
"46878",1581,"thirty-seven thousand dollars to vintage","ep089"
"46879",1584,"touches that I'm so psyched to have in","ep089"
"46880",1587,"this place or the stained glass on the","ep089"
"46881",1590,"big front window that's very dramatic","ep089"
"46882",1593,"and also I've got my wood-burning","ep089"
"46883",1596,"fireplace and I'm having so much fun","ep089"
"46884",1599,"picking design finishes that match with","ep089"
"46885",1602,"the classic charm of my place you know I","ep089"
"46886",1605,"like the penny tile and the hexagon look","ep089"
"46887",1608,"I'm redoing all the floors I got rid of","ep089"
"46888",1611,"the pocket doors between the dining room","ep089"
"46889",1614,"in the living room to create a big open","ep089"
"46890",1617,"space another thing I did that maybe","ep089"
"46891",1620,"took away a little bit of the charm and","ep089"
"46892",1623,"ate at my heartstrings a little bit was","ep089"
"46893",1626,"I got rid of that clawfoot tub I mean","ep089"
"46894",1629,"admittedly I'm really excited to just","ep089"
"46895",1632,"have a big walk-in shower I got it out","ep089"
"46896",1635,"of the wall between the bathroom and the","ep089"

"46902",1653,"then we're gonna have the black hexagon","ep089"
"46903",1656,"floor here one good thing I found taking","ep089"
"46904",1659,"down the wall between the utility closet","ep089"
"46905",1662,"and the bathroom was a window appeared","ep089"
"46906",1665,"so we're gonna pop this window out bring","ep089"
"46907",1668,"the exterior down so the windows gonna","ep089"
"46908",1671,"fit and look like it's built in James","ep089"
"46909",1674,"and I sat down to go over a realistic","ep089"
"46910",1677,"budget and we came to the number of","ep089"

"47050",387,"idea for them to move into a smaller","ep090"
"47051",390,"starter home and then upgrade a few","ep090"
"47052",393,"years down the line when their family","ep090"
"47053",396,"continues to grow this is a nice big","ep090"
"47054",399,"room I'll tell you what I do like off","ep090"
"47055",402,"the bat is the form this is this","ep090"
"47056",405,"original hardwood yep original hardwoods","ep090"
"47057",408,"throughout the whole first floor and is","ep090"
"47058",411,"that the gas fireplace yes it's close","ep090"
"47059",414,"closer right off the main living room","ep090"
"47060",417,"here we have actually a playroom and","ep090"
"47061",420,"it's huge now what do you guys think","ep090"
"47062",423,"about the outdoor space that we can see","ep090"
"47063",426,"from here I don't know it's great that","ep090"
"47064",429,"they have a play set but I'm not seeing","ep090"
"47065",432,"a lot of one where she can be playing","ep090"
"47066",435,"outside mm-hmm so we have a dining room","ep090"
"47067",438,"space here all right and then the","ep090"
"47068",441,"kitchen right after okay I love the","ep090"
"47069",444,"cabinets and maybe it's because the","ep090"
"47070",447,"appliances are gorgeous and I'm obsessed","ep090"
"47071",450,"with this eat-in area yeah I want the","ep090"
"47072",453,"kids to be able to eat while we're in","ep090"
"47073",456,"the kitchen or have a space to hang out","ep090"
"47074",459,"so even though it's not open-concept I","ep090"
"47075",462,"think it still could function the way","ep090"
"47076",465,"that I would want with the layout okay","ep090"
"47077",468,"so then we also have a full basement","ep090"
"47078",471,"that's actually partially finished all","ep090"
"47079",474,"right let's check this out all right so","ep090"
"47080",477,"this is an interesting setup that's","ep090"
"47081",480,"really interesting what they did there","ep090"
"47082",483,"with TV and everything Eddie I think","ep090"
"47083",486,"most people would use a man cave to","ep090"
"47084",489,"watch like football or basketball is","ep090"
"47085",492,"this where you'd watch your kids movies","ep090"
"47086",495,"yeah I mean Aliana yeah they'd watch one","ep090"
"47087",498,"on here and I get to really","ep090"
"47088",501,"[Music]","ep090"
"47089",504,"here we go with our first bedroom okay","ep090"
"47090",507,"so it's a little small so this would be","ep090"
"47091",510,"like all the honors yet yeah or the new","ep090"
"47092",513,"baby's room we have the full bath on","ep090"
"47093",516,"this floor well I love how it's updated","ep090"
"47094",519,"but nice I feel like it's it's very","ep090"
"47095",522,"small for our marriage it's always","ep090"
"47096",525,"better to have two sinks two toilets two","ep090"
"47097",528,"showers all right this is a good-size","ep090"
"47098",531,"room there's like good character in the","ep090"
"47099",534,"home but you know me I'm just not","ep090"
"47100",537,"leaning towards a starter home so how","ep090"
"47101",540,"many years give me a time frame how many","ep090"
"47102",543,"years do we have I thought good four to","ep090"
"47103",546,"five years in 45 years okay this home is","ep090"
"47104",549,"definitely not big enough for me I want","ep090"
"47105",552,"to make sure that we can grow into it","ep090"
"47106",555,"and we're not gonna have to move too","ep090"
"47107",558,"quick this is an awesome starter home","ep090"
"47108",561,"financially it makes so much sense and","ep090"
"47109",564,"also I don't think that we're ready for","ep090"
"47110",567,"a forever house here we have the master","ep090"
"47111",570,"bedroom","ep090"
"47112",573,"this is a nice size okay overall I think","ep090"
"47113",576,"the bedroom sizes are great I definitely","ep090"
"47114",579,"think that one is really small whether","ep090"
"47115",582,"I'd use that as my office or if it would","ep090"
"47116",585,"be more of a nursery or baby's room the","ep090"
"47117",588,"outdoor space I'm not crazy about I'm","ep090"
"47118",591,"really not seeing as much grass as I had","ep090"
"47119",594,"in mind I love the price I love the","ep090"
"47120",597,"option for the playroom so it's designed","ep090"
"47121",600,"beautifully like the house was made","ep090"
"47122",603,"really nice but it's just like it's a","ep090"
"47123",606,"little bit small how long could this","ep090"
"47124",609,"really last roast like it's in our price","ep090"
"47125",612,"range but like how long till you make us","ep090"
"47126",615,"move because right but I mean that's the","ep090"
"47127",618,"whole process of a starter home it just","ep090"
"47128",621,"makes a lot of sense for us and we're","ep090"
"47129",624,"gonna really gain a perspective on","ep090"
"47130",627,"what's important for our forever home","ep090"
"47131",630,"instead of trying to decide that right","ep090"
"47132",633,"now I'm just on the fence about some","ep090"
"47133",636,"things since Eddie wants to see a larger","ep090"
"47134",639,"place with a stone exterior Abby","ep090"
"47135",642,"delivers big-time yes","ep090"
"47136",645,"look at the stonework","ep090"
"47137",648,"[Music]","ep090"
"47138",651,"oh yeah what do you think do you want a","ep090"
"47139",654,"new house yes or no new parents Eddie","ep090"
"47140",657,"and Mandy need more space in suburban","ep090"
"47141",660,"Rochester New York but with up to three","ep090"
"47142",663,"hundred thousand dollars to spend","ep090"
"47143",666,"they're miles apart on what to buy","ep090"
"47144",669,"Eddie dreams of a large stone house the","ep090"
"47145",672,"family can grow in four years but Mandy","ep090"
"47146",675,"is anxious about committing to anything","ep090"
"47147",678,"more than a starter home so far they've","ep090"
"47148",681,"seen a colonial starter that Mandy loves","ep090"
"47149",684,"but Eddie is worried they'll outgrow it","ep090"
"47150",687,"in a few years so today their agent","ep090"
"47151",690,"Mandy's sister Abby has lined up a place","ep090"
"47152",693,"with a little more square footage and a","ep090"
"47153",696,"large grassy lot","ep090"
"47154",699,"I love the cul-de-sac look at the","ep090"
"47155",702,"stonework oh it's beautiful what are you","ep090"
"47156",705,"talking about this is not my style at","ep090"
"47157",708,"all there's just so much stone I like","ep090"
"47158",711,"the stone yes I'm not crazy about it but","ep090"
"47159",714,"what do you have for us three bedrooms","ep090"
"47160",717,"one and a half bathroom that's not ideal","ep090"
"47161",720,"yeah all right so it's currently listed","ep090"
"47162",723,"at one hundred and sixty thousand","ep090"
"47163",726,"dollars hmm so this is the main living","ep090"
"47164",729,"space I mean the carpet doesn't do it","ep090"
"47165",732,"for you","ep090"
"47166",735,"no but I just love the high ceilings","ep090"
"47167",738,"look at the beams look how nice they are","ep090"
"47168",741,"and we got a fireplace yeah nice I","ep090"
"47169",744,"really like how open it is","ep090"
"47170",747,"now when was the house built 1983 yeah I","ep090"
"47171",750,"can tell","ep090"
"47172",753,"everything is ugly in here but I think","ep090"
"47173",756,"it has great potential right no I hear","ep090"
"47174",759,"you","ep090"
"47175",762,"Oh i'll eautiful I love the view I'm","ep090"
"47176",765,"concerned is that a cliff looks like","ep090"
"47177",768,"there's a little bit of a drop-off yeah","ep090"
"47178",771,"it's definitely a cliff it's beautiful","ep090"
"47179",774,"here though a little bit of grass too","ep090"
"47180",777,"it's not so bad I like the space we","ep090"
"47181",780,"would just need to put an offense yeah","ep090"
"47182",783,"that's like right in the budget all","ep090"
"47183",786,"three bedrooms right on the other side","ep090"
"47184",789,"of the house here okay I feel like I got","ep090"
"47185",792,"a walk on this stage at all I know right","ep090"
"47186",795,"it is kind of a weird layout all right","ep090"
"47187",798,"whether this carpet could stay it's not","ep090"
"47188",801,"ideal but it could stay what I am I","ep090"
"47189",804,"don't understand how you think this","ep090"
"47190",807,"traffic can stay let's go back to that","ep090"
"47191",810,"what a Leona's gonna destroy any carpet","ep090"
"47192",813,"we're in this should be like more than","ep090"
"47193",816,"enough for a kid's bedroom agreed here","ep090"
"47194",819,"we have the second bedroom","ep090"
"47195",822,"lovely carpet again see washer and dryer","ep090"
"47196",825,"in a bedroom we could definitely move it","ep090"
"47197",828,"downstairs okay this would be considered","ep090"
"47198",831,"the master bath house yes only one full","ep090"
"47199",834,"bath okay I don't like anything about","ep090"
"47200",837,"the cosmetic this is the biggest bedroom","ep090"
"47201",840,"sighs nice I love the double closets","ep090"
"47202",843,"well let's go to the basement I like","ep090"
"47203",846,"this space so like this could","ep090"
"47204",849,"potentially be like a whole nother","ep090"
"47205",852,"living space yeah","ep090"
"47206",855,"[Music]","ep090"
"47207",858,"overall I like that at 160,000 it's the","ep090"
"47208",861,"price point that I want to be in but","ep090"
"47209",864,"three-bedroom it's a little bit small I","ep090"
"47210",867,"don't want to move in a year I'm not a","ep090"
"47211",870,"fan of the style of this house but I","ep090"
"47212",873,"love how it's open the kitchen we have","ep090"
"47213",876,"the stone front open-concept nice beams","ep090"
"47214",879,"I'm just really concerned about the","ep090"
"47215",882,"cosmetics that are needed throughout the","ep090"
"47216",885,"entire house there's some significant","ep090"
"47217",888,"work that needs to be done for a starter","ep090"
"47218",891,"home that's not what I signed up for","ep090"
"47219",894,"cliff closed the negative and the","ep090"
"47220",897,"three-bedroom you got anything else we","ep090"
"47221",900,"can look at me so now Abbey is taking","ep090"
"47222",903,"them to a much larger more move-in-ready","ep090"
"47223",906,"house but of course it'll cost them so","ep090"
"47224",909,"that's like on the high end of what we","ep090"
"47225",912,"rely on","ep090"
"47226",915,"[Music]","ep090"
"47227",918,"man's this way too much meat I love you","ep090"
"47228",921,"do you want to make your own lunch sure","ep090"
"47229",924,"Eddie and Mandy are searching Rochester","ep090"
"47230",927,"New York for their first home within","ep090"
"47231",930,"their $300,000 max budget but they've","ep090"
"47232",933,"been giving their agent Mandy's sister","ep090"
"47233",936,"Abby a run for her money I love them to","ep090"
"47234",939,"death like they want totally different","ep090"
"47235",942,"things so it's made it pretty difficult","ep090"
"47236",945,"to find them exactly what they're","ep090"
"47237",948,"looking for so far they've seen a","ep090"
"47238",951,"well-priced move-in ready colonial","ep090"
"47239",954,"starter for her then they saw a larger","ep090"
"47240",957,"stone ranch with the exterior look he","ep090"
"47241",960,"likes but it needed work inside and","ep090"
"47242",963,"neither house has the four bedrooms and","ep090"
"47243",966,"two baths Eddie wants so now Abby has","ep090"
"47244",969,"lined up a much bigger place she thinks","ep090"
"47245",972,"will appeal to Eddie there's a lot going","ep090"
"47246",975,"on so let me tell you a little bit about","ep090"
"47247",978,"this house okay very very unique it's","ep090"
"47248",981,"six acres oh man a little bit less than","ep090"
"47249",984,"3,500 square feet four bedrooms and","ep090"
"47250",987,"three full baths that sound good","ep090"
"47251",990,"it's listed at 299 thousand dollars okay","ep090"
"47252",993,"so that's like on the high end of what","ep090"
"47253",996,"very high end so no stone but it's","ep090"
"47254",999,"better than vinyl siding that's for sure","ep090"
"47255",1002,"there's also a fountain right here on","ep090"
"47256",1005,"the side of the house there's a fountain","ep090"
"47257",1008,"buried under all this ice and snow yeah","ep090"
"47258",1011,"all right well let's come on in okay","ep090"
"47259",1014,"whoa","ep090"
"47260",1017,"this is great space yeah I love the","ep090"
"47261",1020,"ceilings and it has that open concept","ep090"
"47262",1023,"that you want - I do like the open","ep090"
"47263",1026,"concept of it and then it goes into the","ep090"
"47264",1029,"living area beautiful fireplace that's","ep090"
"47265",1032,"pretty cool my favorite aspect of this","ep090"
"47266",1035,"property is that it has the fountain it","ep090"
"47267",1038,"has the fireplace and it's not cookie","ep090"
"47268",1041,"cutter the carpet has to go but it'd be","ep090"
"47269",1044,"an easy fix","ep090"
"47270",1047,"oh man check this out oh the outline","ep090"
"47271",1050,"okay these are original holds this place","ep090"

"47276",1065,"Lynne Wow but I feel that because it's","ep090"

"47278",1071,"soccer balls to play lacrosse","ep090"
"47279",1074,"I love six acres but it just doesn't","ep090"
"47280",1077,"seem very functional for me","ep090"
"47281",1080,"okay let's check out the kitchen","ep090"
"47282",1083,"ah it just looks really dated yeah I","ep090"
"47283",1086,"like the eat-in area you could tell it","ep090"
"47284",1089,"was custom it's kind of funky","ep090"
"47285",1092,"I do wish that it was a bit more open","ep090"
"47286",1095,"and I would definitely feel like we","ep090"
"47287",1098,"would need to put some money into this","ep090"
"47288",1101,"fair enough","ep090"
"47289",1104,"we could just order pizza though we","ep090"
"47290",1107,"could we could just order pizza every","ep090"
"47291",1110,"day there's definitely some cosmetic","ep090"
"47292",1113,"stuff to that we're gonna need to fix","ep090"
"47293",1116,"out but there's so much space for a long","ep090"
"47294",1119,"haul forever home we could make this","ep090"
"47295",1122,"work but 299,000 is at the very high end","ep090"
"47296",1125,"of our budget and it just doesn't seem","ep090"
"47297",1128,"like it's a big deal to him oh this is","ep090"
"47298",1131,"really nice","ep090"
"47299",1134,"two sinks in the showers all tile - we","ep090"
"47300",1137,"wouldn't have to do a thing in here and","ep090"
"47301",1140,"that's awesome","ep090"
"47302",1143,"it is really nice so this is the master","ep090"
"47303",1146,"bedroom nice hardwood I love that","ep090"
"47304",1149,"there's the door but again I feel like","ep090"
"47305",1152,"we're gonna need to replace that - Mandy","ep090"
"47306",1155,"I really could see this being your","ep090"
"47307",1158,"office space that's a great eye","ep090"
"47308",1161,"I love these shelves I really like this","ep090"
"47309",1164,"as an office next it's downstairs to see","ep090"
"47310",1167,"the additional beds and baths well we","ep090"
"47311",1170,"have two bathrooms here Eddie and there","ep090"
"47312",1173,"is a sauna this is so cool the rest of","ep090"
"47313",1176,"the at least there's two maybe the","ep090"
"47314",1179,"second one's prettier what is this we'll","ep090"
"47315",1182,"kill the peacock hopefully that would be","ep090"
"47316",1185,"a quick easy fix there's a lot of quick","ep090"
"47317",1188,"easy fixes yeah there's a bit of work","ep090"
"47318",1191,"down the hall they see three bedrooms","ep090"
"47319",1194,"that could work well for the kids then","ep090"
"47320",1197,"head down to see a bonus room this is","ep090"
"47321",1200,"what we like to call the cake what is","ep090"
"47322",1203,"this what do you think I don't even know","ep090"
"47323",1206,"what to say what do you guys think about","ep090"
"47324",1209,"the orange carpet is it weird that","ep090"
"47325",1212,"that's not the first thing that caught","ep090"
"47326",1215,"my eye","ep090"
"47327",1218,"it's sprayed styrofoam was this original","ep090"
"47328",1221,"to the building you know I don't know","ep090"
"47329",1224,"but it's very unique I'll be honest I've","ep090"
"47330",1227,"never seen a cave room before in a house","ep090"
"47331",1230,"and I've been in a few houses I have no","ep090"
"47332",1233,"idea where this cave room came from but","ep090"
"47333",1236,"it's crazy it's a really cool room but","ep090"
"47334",1239,"what what are you gonna do with it","ep090"
"47335",1242,"for 299,000 this is definitely going to","ep090"
"47336",1245,"fall under the forever home category","ep090"
"47337",1248,"instead of the starter home and I'm just","ep090"
"47338",1251,"really worried about the price what are","ep090"
"47339",1254,"the things we like I really love the","ep090"
"47340",1257,"open concept and I love that with the","ep090"
"47341",1260,"kitchen we could easily open it up yeah","ep090"
"47342",1263,"but I like about it four bedrooms by","ep090"
"47343",1266,"your place fountain sauna the six acres","ep090"
"47344",1269,"is nice but it needs work but it's got","ep090"
"47345",1272,"potential","ep090"
"47346",1275,"right what do you think I'm on the phone","ep090"
"47347",1278,"yeah what about the cave room that was","ep090"
"47348",1281,"weird","ep090"
"47349",1284,"that's the only way to say it now it's","ep090"
"47350",1287,"time to decide a move-in-ready starter","ep090"
"47351",1290,"or a forever home that might need some","ep090"
"47352",1293,"work and Mandy is still anxious about","ep090"
"47353",1296,"their choices how do we know that this","ep090"
"47354",1299,"is what we want","ep090"
"47355",1302,"Eddie and Mandy have up to $300,000 to","ep090"
"47356",1305,"spend on their first town they've seen a","ep090"
"47357",1308,"number of places now it's time to decide","ep090"
"47358",1311,"I think the obvious one for me was the","ep090"
"47359",1314,"Colonial listed at $155,000","ep090"
"47360",1317,"it had the playroom I love how the","ep090"
"47361",1320,"kitchen had the eat-in area they had","ep090"
"47362",1323,"some good qualities not the siding but","ep090"
"47363",1326,"it had like nice hardwood floors a hot","ep090"
"47364",1329,"character the biggest challenge for me","ep090"
"47365",1332,"is the one full bath is just so small","ep090"
"47366",1335,"you want an open-concept kitchen didn't","ep090"
"47367",1338,"have that then a lot of the rooms were","ep090"
"47368",1341,"blocked off and smaller we definitely","ep090"
"47369",1344,"will have at least two kids in there at","ep090"
"47370",1347,"that time period and it's just that's","ep090"
"47371",1350,"really tight next is a stone ranch on a","ep090"
"47372",1353,"cul-de-sac listed for 160,000 dollars it","ep090"
"47373",1356,"needs work but it's got potential there","ep090"
"47374",1359,"are updates that need to be made in","ep090"
"47375",1362,"every single room especially the","ep090"
"47376",1365,"appliances and the cabinets they just","ep090"
"47377",1368,"seemed older to me we had three bedrooms","ep090"
"47378",1371,"do you think that's enough space for you","ep090"
"47379",1374,"guys I don't know smaller but I think it","ep090"
"47380",1377,"was a better fit than that colonial the","ep090"
"47381",1380,"big negative for me with that though is","ep090"
"47382",1383,"the cliff in the back it scares me","ep090"
"47383",1386,"I liked the ranch in the woods $299,000","ep090"
"47384",1389,"the price is really hard for me to get","ep090"
"47385",1392,"over my four bedrooms we can make this a","ep090"
"47386",1395,"home that were there a lot longer for","ep090"
"47387",1398,"and watch our kids grow up onto unique","ep090"
"47388",1401,"home it's not cookie cutter I really","ep090"
"47389",1404,"loved the open concept I see the value","ep090"
"47390",1407,"in investing in this house that we're","ep090"
"47391",1410,"gonna stay in for a really long time but","ep090"
"47392",1413,"there is work that needs to be done wait","ep090"
"47393",1416,"and there's the cave room yeah it's just","ep090"
"47394",1419,"weird I don't know what we would do with","ep090"
"47395",1422,"it which one will they choose","ep090"
"47396",1425,"I am NOT a fan of the colonial I would","ep090"
"47397",1428,"rather lean towards the ranch in the","ep090"
"47398",1431,"woods or we can have a smaller hole with","ep090"
"47399",1434,"the cliff it feels like I need to just","ep090"
"47400",1437,"get over the numbers I see the value in","ep090"
"47401",1440,"not having to move again the ranch in","ep090"
"47402",1443,"the woods might be the best fit for our","ep090"
"47403",1446,"family that's a place that we can grow","ep090"
"47404",1449,"into can we put an offering it has been","ep090"
"47405",1452,"on the market for a little bit of time","ep090"
"47406",1455,"so we might be able to negotiate that","ep090"
"47407",1458,"could make a huge difference if we could","ep090"
"47408",1461,"get them down okay we'll work your","ep090"
"47409",1464,"girl's magic we actually just got the","ep090"
"47410",1467,"key one week ago Abby did a pretty good","ep090"
"47411",1470,"job she did great we got it for two","ep090"
"47412",1473,"hundred and seventy thousand dollars it","ep090"
"47413",1476,"really made me feel so much more","ep090"
"47414",1479,"comfortable about making this huge","ep090"
"47415",1482,"financial move I played my cards right I","ep090"
"47416",1485,"didn't have to compromise that much it's","ep090"
"47417",1488,"not cookie cutter and it's just a","ep090"
"47418",1491,"beautiful home on a lot of room I","ep090"
"47419",1494,"totally compromised the most however","ep090"
"47420",1497,"there's not as much work as I had","ep090"
"47421",1500,"originally thought that needs to be done","ep090"
"47422",1503,"to the home right away my favorite space","ep090"
"47423",1506,"in this house is definitely the great","ep090"
"47424",1509,"room I love the open concept I love the","ep090"
"47425",1512,"potential we put some bamboo flooring in","ep090"
"47426",1515,"the great room which was really really","ep090"
"47427",1518,"good hey what are you doing don't touch","ep090"
"47428",1521,"my pillow","ep090"
"47429",1524,"Mandy gave me full rein of the cave room","ep090"
"47430",1527,"bad decision guess what we turned it","ep090"
"47431",1530,"into the master bedroom I think it's a","ep090"
"47432",1533,"big assumption people would think we're","ep090"
"47433",1536,"crazy and not assume we're crazy frankly","ep090"
"47434",1539,"the space works really really well for a","ep090"
"47435",1542,"master bedroom","ep090"
"47436",1545,"bathrooms definitely need updating but","ep090"
"47437",1548,"for right now the space is great for","ep090"
"47438",1551,"sure one of the things Mandy's gonna","ep090"
"47439",1554,"want to get done is gonna be the kitchen","ep090"
"47440",1557,"get some sort of an island and just open","ep090"
"47441",1560,"it up as much as possible","ep090"
"47442",1563,"we haven't been here very long and","ep090"
"47443",1566,"alianna is already in her glory we have","ep090"
"47444",1569,"set up her own little playroom and we","ep090"
"47445",1572,"close the door and it is done Ileana","ep090"
"47446",1575,"do you know that there's gonna be","ep090"
"47447",1578,"another baby soon I get maybe a lot of","ep090"
"47448",1581,"respect because he held really strong on","ep090"
"47449",1584,"to the forever home concept I was so","ep090"
"47450",1587,"stubborn about wanting a starter home","ep090"
"47451",1590,"that I'm really happy that he may have","ep090"
"47452",1593,"been right about this we're good on tape","ep090"
"47453",1596,"it is really nice to be in our new place","ep090"
"47454",1599,"you know we finally have a home but","ep090"
"47455",1602,"being a forever home just means that our","ep090"
"47456",1605,"kids have a consistent house that they","ep090"
"47457",1608,"call home this is their home and it's","ep090"
"47458",1611,"always gonna be their home it's just","ep090"
"47459",1614,"really exciting for what's ahead","ep090"
"47460",12,"Carrie and Marty are saying I'll be the","ep091"
"47461",15,"same to their old lives Seattle is","ep091"
"47462",18,"looking as good as it's ever looked for","ep091"
"47463",21,"a chance to get closer to their family","ep091"
"47464",24,"roots in Berlin Germany this is where my","ep091"
"47465",27,"grandparents brought me Marty wants to","ep091"
"47466",30,"experience the city this is really the","ep091"
"47467",33,"reason why we came here this is the","ep091"
"47468",36,"center of Berlin while Carrie wants","ep091"
"47469",39,"what's best for the family the school I","ep091"
"47470",42,"really want the kids to go to is a","ep091"
"47471",45,"45-minute bus train ride yeah I was","ep091"
"47472",48,"hoping like a five minute bike ride yes","ep091"
"47473",51,"10-minute bike ride but if we're in the","ep091"
"47474",54,"city with a banker you gotta consider","ep091"
"47475",57,"the trade on who's driving crazy guys","ep091"
"47476",60,"[Music]","ep091"
"47477",63,"so like Seattle my parents came from","ep091"
"47478",66,"Berlin so I'm a dual citizen my kids are","ep091"
"47479",69,"both dual citizens to be German American","ep091"
"47480",72,"you kind of have to embrace both sides","ep091"
"47481",75,"well we've lived in America now we need","ep091"
"47482",78,"to explore what living in Germany is","ep091"
"47483",81,"like as well gary is already in Berlin","ep091"
"47484",84,"and the kids have started school so I've","ep091"
"47485",87,"had a few doubts about our mood is this","ep091"
"47486",90,"the right thing to do to our kids moving","ep091"
"47487",93,"them away from their family and friends","ep091"
"47488",96,"into this country that they don't know","ep091"
"47489",99,"anything about is that the right move as","ep091"
"47490",102,"a parent Josie do you like to school but","ep091"
"47491",105,"I feel like our kids are just right at","ep091"
"47492",108,"the cusp of not wanting to hang out with","ep091"
"47493",111,"us much anymore","ep091"
"47494",114,"so we feel like we caught them right at","ep091"
"47495",117,"the outer edge of them thinking it's","ep091"
"47496",120,"cool to do this adventure with us","ep091"
"47497",123,"Seattle is looking as good as it's ever","ep091"
"47498",126,"looked not a beautiful day absolutely","ep091"
"47499",129,"perfect out there","ep091"
"47500",132,"Marty's bosses have agreed to let him do","ep091"
"47501",135,"his radio show remotely so what exactly","ep091"
"47502",138,"are you gonna do in Berlin it's gotta be","ep091"
"47503",141,"like I'm still here we're gonna we're","ep091"
"47504",144,"gonna fake it well and if it doesn't","ep091"
"47505",147,"work then you're fired and we'll pick","ep091"
"47506",150,"somebody else up is great I've worked","ep091"
"47507",153,"with Jodie my my on-air partner for 10","ep091"
"47508",156,"years by moving to the other side of the","ep091"
"47509",159,"globe that's going to affect the rhythm","ep091"
"47510",162,"just make sure that you manage your","ep091"
"47511",165,"situation so we can keep doing the","ep091"
"47512",168,"shadows I fear at some point the company","ep091"
"47513",171,"or my coworkers are gonna say it's not","ep091"
"47514",174,"worth it","ep091"
"47515",177,"enjoy yourself in Berlin and that","ep091"
"47516",180,"concerns me","ep091"
"47517",183,"Berlin is such an amazing mix of that","ep091"
"47518",186,"German efficiency like the buses and the","ep091"
"47519",189,"trains run on time right we're here and","ep091"
"47520",192,"then that weird artsy community that was","ep091"
"47521",195,"the result of it being buried behind the","ep091"
"47522",198,"Iron Curtain","ep091"
"47523",201,"Berlin is aidan enormous city to school","ep091"
"47524",204,"I really want the kids to go to is a","ep091"
"47525",207,"45-minute bus train ride and I'm really","ep091"
"47526",210,"hoping to find a house close enough to","ep091"
"47527",213,"the school the real estate market in","ep091"
"47528",216,"Berlin is really really tough these days","ep091"
"47529",219,"as it's like in the middle of Europe so","ep091"
"47530",222,"guys let me know what you are looking","ep091"
"47531",225,"for four bedrooms would be ideal we'd","ep091"
"47532",228,"say four thousand US dollars a month I","ep091"
"47533",231,"do a radio show in Seattle and I need","ep091"
"47534",234,"quiet space that I can call a studio","ep091"
"47535",237,"where the kids don't annoy me I really","ep091"
"47536",240,"want to be near the kids school okay","ep091"
"47537",243,"this is where we disagree because I want","ep091"
"47538",246,"to experience Berlin and I think most of","ep091"
"47539",249,"that is happening in the city center so","ep091"
"47540",252,"we can take a train to the city from the","ep091"
"47541",255,"suburb right that's that's gonna be our","ep091"
"47542",258,"issue will drive me crazy guys Marty and","ep091"
"47543",261,"Kerry are looking for really different","ep091"
"47544",264,"things he's more focused on his job she","ep091"
"47545",267,"just wants the best for her family I'm","ep091"
"47546",270,"going to have a hard journey here","ep091"
"47547",273,"Simon decides to focus on Marty first so","ep091"
"47548",276,"he's taking them to an ideal location in","ep091"
"47549",279,"hopes to win Kerry over with something","ep091"
"47550",282,"unique hey I feel like we're in the","ep091"
"47551",285,"center because we just stepped across","ep091"
"47552",288,"where the old Berlin Wall used to run","ep091"
"47553",291,"yeah definitely and how about this is to","ep091"
"47554",294,"school I would say on a good day it's 30","ep091"
"47555",297,"minutes on a bad day 45 minutes okay and","ep091"
"47556",300,"price-wise what are we looking at here","ep091"
"47557",303,"we are quite at the limit it's four","ep091"
"47558",306,"thousand US dollars a month oh oh okay","ep091"
"47559",309,"this","ep091"
"47560",312,"the entrance yeah like the entrance is","ep091"
"47561",315,"like really special okay so this is","ep091"
"47562",318,"weird because it looks like we're living","ep091"
"47563",321,"in a gallery it is together oh wow yeah","ep091"
"47564",324,"keep an open mind okay Wow so the","ep091"
"47565",327,"entrance to the apartment is through an","ep091"
"47566",330,"art gallery and then when you go","ep091"
"47567",333,"continue through the art gallery then","ep091"
"47568",336,"you're in the apartment here we have the","ep091"
"47569",339,"kitchen and the dining area of the","ep091"
"47570",342,"apartment it seems like our family is","ep091"
"47571",345,"part of a real-life art exhibit this so","ep091"
"47572",348,"yeah definitely that's a funky thing","ep091"
"47573",351,"about the apartment and something","ep091"
"47574",354,"special it's so different from what we","ep091"
"47575",357,"are used to living in that it adds to","ep091"
"47576",360,"the experience of moving to a foreign","ep091"
"47577",363,"country and living in a foreign city","ep091"
"47578",366,"I think Carrie is far more conservative","ep091"
"47579",369,"in that regard so here we have like the","ep091"
"47580",372,"second bedroom and this has like an open","ep091"
"47581",375,"bathtub over there wow that's really","ep091"
"47582",378,"open it's literally right in the middle","ep091"
"47583",381,"of the bedroom you kinda have to walk","ep091"
"47584",384,"around the bathtub to get to the bed","ep091"
"47585",387,"there's not really a lot of privacy yeah","ep091"
"47586",390,"we have the patio and also it is the","ep091"
"47587",393,"connection to the second part of the","ep091"
"47588",396,"apartment so this is the only outdoor","ep091"
"47589",399,"just the strip of patio yes exactly I","ep091"
"47590",402,"guess we're just used to more open","ep091"
"47591",405,"spaces and where's the city living","ep091"
"47592",408,"she doesn't envision this the same way I","ep091"
"47593",411,"do that she doesn't want to like go out","ep091"
"47594",414,"on a limb and do things differently than","ep091"
"47595",417,"we've done them in the past this is the","ep091"
"47596",420,"second part of the apartment I wanted to","ep091"
"47597",423,"show you a second kitchen exactly yeah","ep091"
"47598",426,"you gotta have a second kitchen here","ep091"
"47599",429,"over here is what I thought could be the","ep091"
"47600",432,"studio for Marty and also your bedroom","ep091"
"47601",435,"oh yeah this is a great space for a","ep091"
"47602",438,"studio that's what I thought would be","ep091"
"47603",441,"such perfect you have your private","ep091"
"47604",444,"studio over here so during the day you","ep091"
"47605",447,"can do your work you are looking at for","ep091"
"47606",450,"me Simon and that's what I like","ep091"
"47607",453,"like seriously this is it I mean it's","ep091"
"47608",456,"gorgeous I really love the studio I","ep091"
"47609",459,"think we could get used to being","ep091"
"47610",462,"somewhat separated from the kids the","ep091"
"47611",465,"kids are getting older they don't need","ep091"
"47612",468,"us like right next door I think that's","ep091"
"47613",471,"kind of silly I mean that's not how you","ep091"
"47614",474,"live your life is having an unattached","ep091"
"47615",477,"apartment from the rest of your family","ep091"
"47616",480,"and on top of that it's 30 it's more","ep091"
"47617",483,"like 45 minutes by public transportation","ep091"
"47618",486,"to the school and the time a long school","ep091"
"47619",489,"day it just doesn't feel like the right","ep091"
"47620",492,"thing to me I'd actually just like to","ep091"
"47621",495,"stay in my studio space you guys go with","ep091"
"47622",498,"me he's never gonna want to leave trust","ep091"
"47623",501,"me","ep091"
"47624",504,"what's the next house I think I have","ep091"
"47625",507,"something a little bit more traditional","ep091"
"47626",510,"oh my gosh it even has an awesome","ep091"
"47627",513,"acoustics for city living it really hits","ep091"
"47628",516,"the mark my issue is its tickle it's not","ep091"
"47629",519,"that close to school this is amazing","ep091"
"47630",522,"this is the Brandenburg Gate this is","ep091"
"47631",525,"where my grandparents brought me and my","ep091"
"47632",528,"sister your aunt when we were your age","ep091"
"47633",531,"Carrie and Marty are expanding their","ep091"
"47634",534,"horizons by taking Marty's job Seattle","ep091"
"47635",537,"is looking as as good as its ever looked","ep091"
"47636",540,"and their family to Berlin Germany Marty","ep091"
"47637",543,"and I have always dreamt of coming and","ep091"
"47638",546,"living in Europe and Germany is the","ep091"
"47639",549,"perfect place Marty's parents grew up","ep091"
"47640",552,"here they went to university here and","ep091"
"47641",555,"we've always dreamt of living here they","ep091"
"47642",558,"couldn't cross because we were in East","ep091"
"47643",561,"Germany there was a wall the Berlin Wall","ep091"
"47644",564,"that kept people from crossing back and","ep091"
"47645",567,"forth so this was like no-man's land","ep091"
"47646",570,"that's awesome this side well actually","ep091"
"47647",573,"yeah but only if you have the right","ep091"
"47648",576,"papers we'd stay with my grandparents","ep091"
"47649",579,"over here in East Germany for a while","ep091"
"47650",582,"and then at the end of our visit we'd","ep091"
"47651",585,"have to cross back over","ep091"
"47652",588,"could you imagine leaving your","ep091"
"47653",591,"grandparents and them not being able to","ep091"
"47654",594,"come with you because of a wall this is","ep091"
"47655",597,"really the reason why we came here","ep091"
"47656",600,"let's let's do what no one else could do","ep091"
"47657",603,"before let's cross underneath it I","ep091"
"47658",606,"wonder if living in Germany for a while","ep091"
"47659",609,"will make me feel a little bit like for","ep091"
"47660",612,"the first time in my life I'm coming","ep091"
"47661",615,"home I hope it brings our family closer","ep091"
"47662",618,"together we're not going with a social","ep091"
"47663",621,"circle we are each other social network","ep091"
"47664",624,"here but so far their apartment search","ep091"
"47665",627,"has been anything but typical so this is","ep091"
"47666",630,"the only outdoor just this strip of","ep091"
"47667",633,"patio she doesn't want to like go out on","ep091"
"47668",636,"a limb and do things differently than","ep091"
"47669",639,"we've done them in the past oh yeah this","ep091"
"47670",642,"is a great space for a studio I mean","ep091"
"47671",645,"it's gorgeous","ep091"
"47672",648,"I do a radio show in Seattle and I'm","ep091"
"47673",651,"gonna try to keep doing it here from","ep091"
"47674",654,"Berlin we can easily turn that into my","ep091"
"47675",657,"studio and it's beautiful I think that's","ep091"
"47676",660,"kind of silly I mean that's not how you","ep091"
"47677",663,"live your life is having an unattached","ep091"
"47678",666,"apartment from the rest of your family","ep091"
"47679",669,"and on top of that it's 30 it's more","ep091"
"47680",672,"like 45 minutes by public transportation","ep091"
"47681",675,"to the school roof the next house I","ep091"
"47682",678,"think I have something a little bit more","ep091"
"47683",681,"traditional and a bit closer to the","ep091"
"47684",684,"school and I think then it's going to be","ep091"
"47685",687,"perfect for them so we are here in the","ep091"
"47686",690,"really center of town I would say the","ep091"
"47687",693,"distance to school is about 20 to 30","ep091"
"47688",696,"minutes by public transport or car yeah","ep091"
"47689",699,"I was hoping like a five-minute bike","ep091"
"47690",702,"ride yeah but if we're in the center you","ep091"
"47691",705,"got to consider the trade-off that on","ep091"
"47692",708,"the weekends then we don't have to take","ep091"
"47693",711,"a bus cuz we're right here","ep091"
"47694",714,"I don't know that me a 30-minute bus","ep091"
"47695",717,"right on each end of their schooldays","ep091"
"47696",720,"long day I think he doesn't really","ep091"
"47697",723,"understand how much that's gonna impact","ep091"
"47698",726,"our life in such a big way but it does","ep091"
"47699",729,"seem like we're on a really busy street","ep091"
"47700",732,"here","ep091"
"47701",735,"no worries the apartment is not that the","ep091"
"47702",738,"street the apartment is at the back","ep091"

"47706",750,"make that work","ep091"
"47707",753,"well let's can we make it work how much","ep091"
"47708",756,"does it cost thirty five hundred US","ep091"
"47709",759,"dollar a month great","ep091"
"47710",762,"duck duck that's nice I like the high","ep091"

"47718",786,"really has nice and high ceilings that's","ep091"
"47719",789,"cool yeah I think living in this place","ep091"

"47724",804,"more to see so let's move on this is","ep091"
"47725",807,"like the huge living room and the","ep091"

"47729",819,"having a meal here and kids doing their","ep091"
"47730",822,"homework there what surprised me about","ep091"
"47731",825,"Carrie's reaction is that she liked it","ep091"
"47732",828,"as much as she did","ep091"
"47733",831,"yeah it's true for city living it really","ep091"
"47734",834,"hits the mark but location to where our","ep091"
"47735",837,"kids are gonna go to school is not so","ep091"
"47736",840,"great","ep091"
"47737",843,"let me ask you about the outside there a","ep091"
"47738",846,"backyard no it's like only a terrace but","ep091"
"47739",849,"you know you're in the center of Berlin","ep091"
"47740",852,"so to have a terrace in the middle of","ep091"
"47741",855,"town it's really really lectures and","ep091"
"47742",858,"rare now we come to the highlight this","ep091"
"47743",861,"is the huge master bedroom yeah great","ep091"
"47744",864,"hold on what's this Wow Marty that's my","ep091"
"47745",867,"surprise for you","ep091"

"47753",891,"it is and I really like the open space I","ep091"
"47754",894,"like the modern my issue is still it's","ep091"
"47755",897,"not that close to school since you work","ep091"
"47756",900,"out of the home you don't have to","ep091"
"47757",903,"commute we will have to commute twice a","ep091"
"47758",906,"day and I want a little homier a little","ep091"
"47759",909,"yard yeah maybe that's my American","ep091"
"47760",912,"expectations and I need to get rid of","ep091"
"47761",915,"that yes yes I feel like it's almost","ep091"
"47762",918,"perfect it's just like this much off are","ep091"
"47763",921,"we still in Germany because we drove","ep091"
"47764",924,"forever to get here yeah","ep091"
"47765",927,"when Carrie wants to stay so close to","ep091"
"47766",930,"the school then yeah Marty probably","ep091"
"47767",933,"needs to do a compromise yeah this is","ep091"
"47768",936,"great","ep091"
"47769",939,"really when in Berlin do like winners","ep091"
"47770",942,"we're getting falafel Kerry and Marty","ep091"
"47771",945,"are trying to strike a balance between","ep091"
"47772",948,"work it's got to be like I'm still here","ep091"
"47773",951,"and family as they search for their new","ep091"
"47774",954,"home in Berlin Germany hear all that you","ep091"
"47775",957,"order Carrie and the challenge of living","ep091"
"47776",960,"in a new country has been quite the","ep091"
"47777",963,"learning experience I'm all telephone","ep091"
"47778",966,"honestly I think I'm a talker and even","ep091"
"47779",969,"in my week being here I found that I","ep091"
"47780",972,"can't talk to people so that has felt","ep091"
"47781",975,"like one of my arms of two and my arms","ep091"
"47782",978,"have been cut off this big Steiner he","ep091"
"47783",981,"just said you sound like a real German","ep091"
"47784",984,"I'm not as as social as as carriers you","ep091"
"47785",987,"know people think that if you're in","ep091"
"47786",990,"radio well you've got to be really","ep091"
"47787",993,"social it's you're not because I sit in","ep091"
"47788",996,"a room with three other people that's","ep091"
"47789",999,"delicious","ep091"
"47790",1002,"Marty is a very unique person and I'm","ep091"
"47791",1005,"learning even in my week being here that","ep091"
"47792",1008,"he is very German to the core oh my gosh","ep091"
"47793",1011,"even has awesome acoustics I'm","ep091"
"47794",1014,"understanding him more as we continue","ep091"
"47795",1017,"our time here I'd actually just like to","ep091"
"47796",1020,"stay in my studio space you guys go with","ep091"
"47797",1023,"without me it's so different from what","ep091"
"47798",1026,"we are used to living in that it adds to","ep091"
"47799",1029,"the experience of moving to a foreign","ep091"
"47800",1032,"country","ep091"
"47801",1035,"living in a foreign city I really like","ep091"
"47802",1038,"the open space I like the modern my","ep091"
"47803",1041,"issue is still it's not that close to","ep091"
"47804",1044,"school we will have to commute twice a","ep091"
"47805",1047,"day I'm gonna look now for a place which","ep091"
"47806",1050,"is really really close to the school and","ep091"
"47807",1053,"forget about the central location so","ep091"
"47808",1056,"that at this time maybe can convince","ep091"
"47809",1059,"Carrie","ep091"
"47810",1062,"are we still in Germany because we drove","ep091"
"47811",1065,"forever to get here not only in Germany","ep091"
"47812",1068,"are we we are still in Berlin oh of","ep091"
"47813",1071,"course it's not the city center anymore","ep091"
"47814",1074,"but we are really close to school and","ep091"
"47815",1077,"its maximum of five minute bike ride and","ep091"
"47816",1080,"it's way under your budget we have a","ep091"
"47817",1083,"monthly rent of 3100 US dollars a month","ep091"
"47818",1086,"so let's go inside I'll show you the","ep091"
"47819",1089,"house all right look living in the","ep091"
"47820",1092,"outlying areas scares me a bit sure","ep091"
"47821",1095,"maybe at the beginning we'll still","ep091"
"47822",1098,"venture into the city from time to time","ep091"
"47823",1101,"but otherwise we'll get lazy and we","ep091"
"47824",1104,"won't go in to see the museums and the","ep091"
"47825",1107,"sights in the city centre please come in","ep091"
"47826",1110,"we got a really authentic German kitchen","ep091"
"47827",1113,"but it has modern devices in it yeah","ep091"
"47828",1116,"this is great","ep091"
"47829",1119,"really it's old and small yeah reminds","ep091"
"47830",1122,"me very much of my grandparents when I","ep091"
"47831",1125,"used to come to Germany and visit when I","ep091"
"47832",1128,"was a kid so that's kind of my weird","ep091"
"47833",1131,"hang-up about the place so guys please","ep091"
"47834",1134,"come in into a huge living room and a","ep091"
"47835",1137,"really nice dining room and is that our","ep091"

"47840",1152,"get that that's a great play area for","ep091"
"47841",1155,"the kids but I also wanted to get away","ep091"
"47842",1158,"from having to maintain a yard by coming","ep091"
"47843",1161,"to Europe and moving into the city here","ep091"
"47844",1164,"we come to the second floor I think","ep091"
"47845",1167,"that's a really","ep091"
"47846",1170,"nice room what do you think yeah this is","ep091"
"47847",1173,"great I hear a little squeak in the","ep091"
"47848",1176,"floor stop dead guys you're driving me","ep091"
"47849",1179,"nuts I think that's like the typical","ep091"
"47850",1182,"feeling about a real wooden floor I did","ep091"
"47851",1185,"it makes a bit of salt okay it's got","ep091"

"48081",375,"Avenue yeah well I've never heard of a","ep092"
"48082",378,"big city without any noise so I kind of","ep092"
"48083",381,"prepared myself for that I think this","ep092"
"48084",384,"place is decent but I think that's an","ep092"
"48085",387,"older style because it's how I grow up","ep092"
"48086",390,"like my grandma style floor","ep092"
"48087",393,"hey it's not my favorite okay so this is","ep092"
"48088",396,"the master bedroom","ep092"
"48089",399,"yes these rooms are very small maybe I'm","ep092"
"48090",402,"just too big I think that's what it is","ep092"

"48094",414,"with people like me in mind the Columbia","ep092"
"48095",417,"style is definitely small bedrooms and","ep092"
"48096",420,"bathrooms but I actually like them and","ep092"
"48097",423,"of course you know if you're right in","ep092"
"48098",426,"the heart of the city so I'm all to make","ep092"
"48099",429,"those compromises their thoughts about","ep092"
"48100",432,"this place I like it you know I like the","ep092"
"48101",435,"kind of traditional feel","ep092"
"48102",438,"it's got three bedrooms at the big plus","ep092"
"48103",441,"yeah a little bit cramped but you know","ep092"
"48104",444,"it's an open bottle which is right here","ep092"
"48105",447,"and the heart of the action I think the","ep092"
"48106",450,"view is really nice by seller of noise","ep092"
"48107",453,"and I don't like the floor because","ep092"
"48108",456,"they're like grandma style","ep092"
"48109",459,"really yes they are","ep092"
"48110",462,"I like it not so much I'm really getting","ep092"

"48118",486,"welcome to Monticello green and quiet is","ep092"

"48487",90,"peacock I got a flight Ecuador is an","ep093"
"48488",93,"adventure country it has the rainforest","ep093"
"48489",96,"I could go to the beach I could go to","ep093"
"48490",99,"the Andes the Galapagos Island it's","ep093"
"48491",102,"amazing and Ketones basically it's a","ep093"
"48492",105,"capital it's a hub so once I figured out","ep093"
"48493",108,"how to do my business remotely I figured","ep093"
"48494",111,"hey I could do right from there so","ep093"
"48495",114,"moving to Ecuador just me and my dog","ep093"
"48496",117,"ginger a lot of people would even dream","ep093"

"48511",162,"is a move that he needs to make but I","ep093"

"48863",1218,"keep him on a sensible path to a happy","ep093"
"48864",1221,"home","ep093"
"48865",1224,"but even she still has a few things to","ep093"
"48866",1227,"learn like your opinion about houses so","ep093"
"48867",1230,"the modern apartment has everything in","ep093"
"48868",1233,"it and had a brand-new kitchen and the","ep093"
"48869",1236,"views amazing yeah but it wasn't colonia","ep093"
"48870",1239,"and it wasn't in central historical","ep093"
"48871",1242,"that's what I wanted that's true let's","ep093"
"48872",1245,"talk about the suburban house it was","ep093"
"48873",1248,"very spacious and had a big kitchen","ep093"
"48874",1251,"however it's $100 over budget and it's","ep093"
"48875",1254,"really really far from town yeah that's","ep093"
"48876",1257,"true that wasn't my style what about the","ep093"
"48877",1260,"colonial oh it's close to the center of","ep093"
"48878",1263,"town it has the whole colonial feel and","ep093"
"48879",1266,"it's under budget but the kitchen was","ep093"
"48880",1269,"tiny it was basically two hot plates in","ep093"
"48881",1272,"a beer fridge yeah that's true","ep093"
"48882",1275,"and it was in the basement at Star I was","ep093"
"48883",1278,"expecting to see a ghost walk out of the","ep093"
"48884",1281,"guest bedroom","ep093"
"48885",1284,"I think the suburban house should be off","ep093"
"48886",1287,"the list I totally agree with that","ep093"
"48887",1290,"you know the first thing of real estate","ep093"
"48888",1293,"is location and that place is just way","ep093"
"48889",1296,"too far and it's a hundred dollars over","ep093"
"48890",1299,"budget I agree with that is definitely a","ep093"
"48891",1302,"no-go so it's between the modern","ep093"
"48892",1305,"apartment and the dungeon and how you","ep093"
"48893",1308,"means the Ottoman Medicaid yeah what","ep093"
"48894",1311,"about it that case was awesome it's in","ep093"
"48895",1314,"central historical that's where I want","ep093"
"48896",1317,"to be and when you walk in it was just a","ep093"
"48897",1320,"cool feeling it's so different it is","ep093"
"48898",1323,"different it's the difference between","ep093"

"48904",1341,"master bedroom was huge in the view was","ep093"
"48905",1344,"incredible but look at the guest bedroom","ep093"
"48906",1347,"that's a tiny room but in the colonial","ep093"
"48907",1350,"that guest room had a big bed it was","ep093"
"48908",1353,"very authentic so when my guests come","ep093"
"48909",1356,"they're actually getting the whole","ep093"
"48910",1359,"Ecuadorian feel that's true","ep093"

"49481",207,"parents weren't there we are trying to","ep095"
"49482",210,"find a place now in sihanoukville but","ep095"

"49503",273,"house with lots of natural light for me","ep095"
"49504",276,"the priority is the budget to stay under","ep095"
"49505",279,"$500 per month and prefer to live on the","ep095"
"49506",282,"island so there is no commute to work","ep095"
"49507",285,"you won't find a Western house on the","ep095"

"49515",309,"can find","ep095"
"49516",312,"Western amenities are limited on koh","ep095"
"49517",315,"rong island near the site of their new","ep095"
"49518",318,"resort so Saeng kicks things off on the","ep095"
"49519",321,"mainland","ep095"
"49520",324,"knowing the commute by ferry could be an","ep095"
"49521",327,"issue for Luke so how many bedrooms in","ep095"
"49522",330,"this one it's two bedrooms okay so the","ep095"
"49523",333,"boys will have to share how much is it","ep095"
"49524",336,"it's a $600 over the budget so it's nice","ep095"
"49525",339,"it's cute actually","ep095"
"49526",342,"so western-style can we have a look","ep095"
"49527",345,"please yeah please have a look","ep095"

"49530",354,"with the furniture just these okay at","ep095"
"49531",357,"least there's a few things we'd have to","ep095"
"49532",360,"buy an aircon that's the number one","ep095"
"49533",363,"thing yeah but the ceilings like they","ep095"
"49534",366,"got all the leaks and everything are","ep095"

"49537",375,"have to do it myself","ep095"
"49538",378,"yeah I guess that's Cambodia life for","ep095"
"49539",381,"you then","ep095"
"49540",384,"hmm it's not so bright so is this the","ep095"
"49541",387,"bigger bedroom yeah this is a the","ep095"
"49542",390,"biggest bedroom because they will have","ep095"
"49543",393,"to get a second bed","ep095"

"49546",402,"this one I like this one looks nice and","ep095"
"49547",405,"clean and the light is pretty good","ep095"
"49548",408,"[Music]","ep095"
"49549",411,"dog here that's because of the","ep095"
"49550",414,"protection outside it's making the room","ep095"
"49551",417,"green there's no way of removing that at","ep095"
"49552",420,"all is that I guess you can do something","ep095"
"49553",423,"about it again myself yeah of course of","ep095"
"49554",426,"course you need to do it","ep095"
"49555",429,"Joshua seems to be liking that this","ep095"
"49556",432,"house in western style but it's over the","ep095"
"49557",435,"budget and all those things need to be","ep095"
"49558",438,"fixed so there's an ensuite there's no","ep095"
"49559",441,"windows wow that's really dark in here","ep095"
"49560",444,"very simple with no soulstealer","ep095"
"49561",447,"yeah look at that I guess I say the","ep095"

"49564",456,"myself again yes I guess so you've got a","ep095"
"49565",459,"lot of work on your plane I think Luke","ep095"
"49566",462,"was just thinking budget it's over","ep095"
"49567",465,"budgets over budget there's nothing to","ep095"
"49568",468,"really think about I was more hopeful we","ep095"
"49569",471,"could definitely work out the schematics","ep095"
"49570",474,"it looked really quite Western yes this","ep095"
"49571",477,"is a kitchen have a look okay there's","ep095"
"49572",480,"not too bad","ep095"
"49573",483,"we got washing machine free so it's two","ep095"
"49574",486,"of the biggest expenses we don't have to","ep095"
"49575",489,"buy well there's no oven","ep095"
"49576",492,"no no away you just need to buy it for","ep095"
"49577",495,"yourself all right","ep095"
"49578",498,"every kitchen I've seen in my lifetime","ep095"
"49579",501,"has an oven it's just there how do they","ep095"

"49582",510,"backyard no no backyard","ep095"
"49583",513,"nothing real yeah but just be difficult","ep095"
"49584",516,"for the boys and the dog because they","ep095"
"49585",519,"can get a little bit rowdy how much is","ep095"
"49586",522,"it again it's a $600 is that okay with","ep095"
"49587",525,"you my budget was 500 and there's so","ep095"
"49588",528,"many things that I'll need to fix around","ep095"
"49589",531,"here I have a mixed reaction I mean I","ep095"
"49590",534,"like it because overall it's western","ep095"
"49591",537,"style which is what I want it we've got","ep095"
"49592",540,"the mod cons I mean it's not exactly","ep095"
"49593",543,"what I'm used to in Sydney but obviously","ep095"
"49594",546,"I'll have to give up something here at","ep095"
"49595",549,"the end of the day budget is one of the","ep095"
"49596",552,"crucial things and for me it's quite a","ep095"
"49597",555,"long commute and I really wanted to","ep095"

"49797",1155,"Cambodia so I'm not really gonna get","ep095"

"49799",1161,"bedrooms it's what I wanted boys","ep095"
"49800",1164,"wouldn't have to share but walking","ep095"
"49801",1167,"through the house I'm really not","ep095"
"49802",1170,"impressed gosh I will have to give up","ep095"
"49803",1173,"the Western world because it doesn't","ep095"
"49804",1176,"exist here it doesn't exist in Cambodia","ep095"
"49805",1179,"everything is Cambodia style Cambodia","ep095"
"49806",1182,"way oh that's a lot of outdoor space you","ep095"
"49807",1185,"can imagine the boys and the dog would","ep095"
"49808",1188,"really enjoy hanging out here we've got","ep095"
"49809",1191,"a pool that's a nice bonus I wouldn't","ep095"
"49810",1194,"put a foot in there now mm-hmm","ep095"
"49811",1197,"it's been abandoned for three months now","ep095"
"49812",1200,"and I guess I would have to clean it","ep095"
"49813",1203,"myself right yeah you'll do your own","ep095"
"49814",1206,"cleaning yes I mean this outdoor space","ep095"
"49815",1209,"could really change my mind about this","ep095"
"49816",1212,"place I like spending a lot of time","ep095"
"49817",1215,"outside and so do the kids of course and","ep095"
"49818",1218,"I think we could make that quite a nice","ep095"
"49819",1221,"livable area it's a large house but over","ep095"
"49820",1224,"the budget that I was expecting to spend","ep095"
"49821",1227,"too many things to fix and clean and for","ep095"
"49822",1230,"me it's quite a long commute I'm really","ep095"
"49823",1233,"worried it's way over my budget and","ep095"
"49824",1236,"definitely non-western style but kosher","ep095"
"49825",1239,"seems to be liking that other area and","ep095"
"49826",1242,"that's a bit of a worry because","ep095"
"49827",1245,"certainly not something that I expected","ep095"
"49828",1248,"or I'm thinking about","ep095"
"49829",1251,"to start with it's well over the budget","ep095"
"49830",1254,"and it's very far away from the island I","ep095"
"49831",1257,"know in the budget and the location is","ep095"
"49832",1260,"so important to you but that's a really","ep095"
"49833",1263,"big decision to make","ep095"
"49834",1266,"Luke and Dasha are ditching their hectic","ep095"
"49835",1269,"corporate jobs and big house back in","ep095"
"49836",1272,"Australia and redesigning their lives in","ep095"
"49837",1275,"Cambodia we're gonna have","ep095"
"49838",1278,"good family time together highs in that","ep095"
"49839",1281,"gray sihanoukville province is an","ep095"
"49840",1284,"up-and-coming travel destination and","ep095"
"49841",1287,"it's the future side of their new resort","ep095"
"49842",1290,"do you think we can find a house here","ep095"
"49843",1293,"I'm not quite sure but with a simpler","ep095"
"49844",1296,"way of living in the region and their","ep095"
"49845",1299,"money tied up in a brand new venture","ep095"
"49846",1302,"they need to decide what they're willing","ep095"
"49847",1305,"to live without what about the 2 bedroom","ep095"
"49848",1308,"villa for 600 before me steel it's over","ep095"
"49849",1311,"the budget and it's far away from the","ep095"
"49850",1314,"island at the same time it's quite","ep095"
"49851",1317,"modern it's not too bad","ep095"
"49852",1320,"washing machine freeze the kitchens okay","ep095"
"49853",1323,"I can live without an oven but I really","ep095"
"49854",1326,"don't like that there's no outdoor space","ep095"
"49855",1329,"backyard so that's gonna be a little","ep095"
"49856",1332,"tough on their kids in the dog what","ep095"
"49857",1335,"about the island house for me it's so","ep095"
"49858",1338,"close to work and it's right on the","ep095"
"49859",1341,"beach and it's $200 I know you'd be","ep095"
"49860",1344,"saving a lot of money but I just don't","ep095"
"49861",1347,"think I'd be able to handle I don't know","ep095"
"49862",1350,"how the kids will be able to handle it I","ep095"
"49863",1353,"mean it's really off the grid that's the","ep095"
"49864",1356,"bathroom yeah just stand up there's no","ep095"
"49865",1359,"mod cons of whatsoever","ep095"
"49866",1362,"I'd really have to have a big think","ep095"
"49867",1365,"about it what do you think about the","ep095"
"49868",1368,"three bedroom villa it ticks the boxes","ep095"
"49869",1371,"for the three bedrooms and I like the","ep095"
"49870",1374,"outdoor area we got a pool","ep095"
"49871",1377,"that's a nice","ep095"
"49872",1380,"the boys would love the pool once it's","ep095"
"49873",1383,"cleaned off the dog would have its base","ep095"
"49874",1386,"to run around for me to start with it's","ep095"
"49875",1389,"well over the budget and there's so many","ep095"
"49876",1392,"things to add that's the kitchen yeah","ep095"
"49877",1395,"you're missing everything in here you","ep095"
"49878",1398,"need just to buy extra stuff","ep095"
"49879",1401,"[Music]","ep095"
"49880",1404,"I mean for me it's a no-brainer I'm","ep095"
"49881",1407,"sorry but the shack is out just way too","ep095"
"49882",1410,"much that would need to be done to that","ep095"
"49883",1413,"place it's just too too simple for me to","ep095"
"49884",1416,"even consider I can understand that's a","ep095"
"49885",1419,"big culture shock for you","ep095"
"49886",1422,"no matter how much money we're saving I","ep095"
"49887",1425,"really could not imagine myself living","ep095"
"49888",1428,"in those circumstances so that leaves us","ep095"
"49889",1431,"with two options the three-bedroom pool","ep095"
"49890",1434,"villa and the two-bedroom the location","ep095"
"49891",1437,"is much the same so that doesn't really","ep095"
"49892",1440,"help us for me really it's all about the","ep095"
"49893",1443,"outdoor space two boys with heaps of","ep095"
"49894",1446,"energy and a dog so that's the plus for","ep095"
"49895",1449,"the three-bedroom Villa there's a lot of","ep095"
"49896",1452,"outdoor area there's a pool if we clean","ep095"
"49897",1455,"it up well it's very expensive and has","ep095"
"49898",1458,"no kitchen and has no hot water in it","ep095"
"49899",1461,"it's a big expense in the two-bedroom","ep095"
"49900",1464,"villa","ep095"
"49901",1467,"I just don't know with the outdoor area","ep095"
"49902",1470,"having none really there's just no way","ep095"
"49903",1473,"for them to run around I guess two","ep095"
"49904",1476,"bedroom villa we'll have to put up with","ep095"
"49905",1479,"all the bathrooms and water leaks and","ep095"
"49906",1482,"there's a lot of things to be fixed but","ep095"
"49907",1485,"the bigger house will have definitely","ep095"
"49908",1488,"much more work and more money the two","ep095"
"49909",1491,"bedroom villa with the final answer is","ep095"
"49910",1494,"that we have taken for our family will","ep095"
"49911",1497,"be the best choice I don't know I'm not","ep095"
"49912",1500,"too happy about the boys sharing the","ep095"

"50212",789,"really need I like that it's a ranch","ep096"
"50213",792,"homes it's not exactly my style I do","ep096"
"50214",795,"prefer either a craftsman or a bungalow","ep096"
"50215",798,"I really love the size of this front","ep096"
"50216",801,"property we did want to do a circle","ep096"
"50217",804,"driveway going out look really good here","ep096"

"50219",810,"plenty of room to park the boat so I","ep096"
"50220",813,"really like the impression when I first","ep096"
"50221",816,"came off the curb side and solved in the","ep096"
"50222",819,"ranch house I liked how I can add to the","ep096"
"50223",822,"driveway do the circle driveway I had","ep096"
"50224",825,"plenty of room for the boat this is a","ep096"
"50225",828,"wood frame home it is not concrete block","ep096"
"50226",831,"like you originally wanted can we live","ep096"
"50227",834,"with that I wonder if it has shutters","ep096"
"50228",837,"for it I don't see anything out right","ep096"
"50229",840,"now take a look inside go look oh wow","ep096"
"50230",843,"it's cute huh I like the openness it's","ep096"
"50231",846,"beautiful how you can just see all the","ep096"
"50232",849,"way out to the back when you first walk","ep096"
"50233",852,"in I love that there's a fireplace","ep096"
"50234",855,"it's so cute your stockings yeah baby","ep096"
"50235",858,"what do you think about the shelves I","ep096"
"50236",861,"could probably do without that okay over","ep096"
"50237",864,"here you have your formal dining room","ep096"
"50238",867,"light fixtures got to go but I like the","ep096"
"50239",870,"room you don't like this light fixture","ep096"
"50240",873,"Hale","ep096"
"50241",876,"not really never here guys we have your","ep096"
"50242",879,"family room so this is like a little bit","ep096"
"50243",882,"more of an informal family area yeah we","ep096"
"50244",885,"could have a little area here set up","ep096"
"50245",888,"with the TV so when you're cooking we","ep096"
"50246",891,"can all be part of the fun well yeah I","ep096"
"50247",894,"like the idea though too that we could","ep096"
"50248",897,"have that as the TV room and this would","ep096"
"50249",900,"be a little bit more of an informal spot","ep096"
"50250",903,"and behind you Suzanne look what you got","ep096"
"50251",906,"I love it I love the counter space lot","ep096"
"50252",909,"of cabinet space yeah the only thing is","ep096"
"50253",912,"it's like they updated the countertops","ep096"
"50254",915,"and then painted the cabinets and the","ep096"
"50255",918,"backsplash is still it's just kind of","ep096"
"50256",921,"mismatched bowls of ix+","ep096"
"50257",924,"it's pretty it just doesn't go with the","ep096"
"50258",927,"kitchen so before we head outside let me","ep096"
"50259",930,"show you guys the bedrooms hey guys this","ep096"

"50263",942,"save this little spot for Rob yeah all","ep096"
"50264",945,"right it's nice at least there's a","ep096"
"50265",948,"master bath it's probably like half the","ep096"
"50266",951,"size of the bathroom we had least half","ep096"
"50267",954,"so it is a little bit small but at least","ep096"
"50268",957,"we'd have our own bathroom down the hall","ep096"
"50269",960,"is the guest bath and two bedrooms even","ep096"
"50270",963,"though the bedrooms are nice and I like","ep096"
"50271",966,"that they're together I was really","ep096"
"50272",969,"looking for that fourth bedroom okay","ep096"
"50273",972,"guys and out here we have your covered","ep096"
"50274",975,"lanai like I like a stranger and now","ep096"

"50277",984,"backyard I'm not really comfortable","ep096"
"50278",987,"though with how open it is with a baby","ep096"
"50279",990,"you know it's kind of scary to think","ep096"
"50280",993,"about I'm pretty concerned about the","ep096"
"50281",996,"fact that there's no fence around the","ep096"
"50282",999,"pool for the baby I mean from a parent's","ep096"
"50283",1002,"point of view you want some kind of","ep096"
"50284",1005,"protection or something there to put","ep096"
"50285",1008,"something between the pool and your baby","ep096"
"50286",1011,"and I agree it's something we definitely","ep096"
"50287",1014,"need yeah we definitely have to do that","ep096"
"50288",1017,"[Music]","ep096"
"50289",1020,"I like the inside the outsides great","ep096"
"50290",1023,"great area it's a little high on the","ep096"
"50291",1026,"price for me yeah I don't think the","ep096"
"50292",1029,"price is that bad","ep096"
"50293",1032,"Suzanne was one to stick to the 300,000","ep096"
"50294",1035,"but I know realistically in this area","ep096"
"50295",1038,"we're gonna have to give ourselves a","ep096"
"50296",1041,"little bit of leeway and we're not","ep096"
"50297",1044,"getting that fourth bedroom you know","ep096"
"50298",1047,"this was nice actually like we're","ep096"
"50299",1050,"gaining another room you know this is a","ep096"
"50300",1053,"place that we can come out and sit sure","ep096"
"50301",1056,"but there are a few things with in","ep096"
"50302",1059,"regards to the budget that we would have","ep096"
"50303",1062,"to think about we want the circular","ep096"
"50304",1065,"driveway hurricane protection right she","ep096"
"50305",1068,"and the baby fence just cost just kind","ep096"
"50306",1071,"of keep adding up I would like to see","ep096"
"50307",1074,"some houses with concrete block","ep096"
"50308",1077,"construction and maybe the fourth","ep096"
"50309",1080,"bedroom so the next house has that","ep096"
"50310",1083,"fourth bedroom and the concrete block","ep096"
"50311",1086,"but hey honey","ep096"
"50312",1089,"[Music]","ep096"
"50313",1092,"with a max budget of 350,000 dollars","ep096"
"50314",1095,"Robert and Suzanne are looking for a","ep096"
"50315",1098,"four-bedroom home in Palm City Florida","ep096"
"50316",1101,"so far they've seen a Craftsman bungalow","ep096"
"50317",1104,"with the charm Suzanne wants and the","ep096"
"50318",1107,"four bedrooms they prefer but parking","ep096"
"50319",1110,"for the boat would be tight and it was","ep096"
"50320",1113,"at the top of their budget then they saw","ep096"
"50321",1116,"a more modern ranch more to Robert's","ep096"
"50322",1119,"taste with ideal boat parking but there","ep096"
"50323",1122,"was no fourth bedroom and neither home","ep096"
"50324",1125,"was constructed with hurricane resistant","ep096"
"50325",1128,"concrete blocks oh my gosh it's so cute","ep096"
"50326",1131,"I love it what do you think yes","ep096"
"50327",1134,"definitely your style so I think this is","ep096"
"50328",1137,"a great compromise for you guys okay","ep096"
"50329",1140,"it's really cute I love the Key West","ep096"
"50330",1143,"bungalow look this house is a","ep096"
"50331",1146,"four-bedroom three-bath concrete block","ep096"
"50332",1149,"with impact windows so the list price is","ep096"
"50333",1152,"360 360 Julie honey it is a budget but","ep096"
"50334",1155,"it has a lot of the features that you're","ep096"
"50335",1158,"looking for but I'm worried about the","ep096"
"50336",1161,"size of the driveway I don't have room","ep096"
"50337",1164,"for the boat and there's no way to put a","ep096"
"50338",1167,"circle driveway in here the front yard","ep096"
"50339",1170,"is this very small you're gonna have to","ep096"
"50340",1173,"compromise a few things so for Robert it","ep096"
"50341",1176,"is really important to have room for","ep096"
"50342",1179,"their boats and for the circle driveway","ep096"
"50343",1182,"I don't know if he's going to compromise","ep096"
"50344",1185,"on that or not that's something I could","ep096"
"50345",1188,"probably compromise on but I don't know","ep096"
"50346",1191,"we'll have to see let's go in and take a","ep096"
"50347",1194,"look all right let's take a look","ep096"
"50348",1197,"oh my gosh that's great","ep096"
"50349",1200,"walking in the house I see this big","ep096"
"50350",1203,"open-concept great room I can see from","ep096"
"50351",1206,"the front of the house to the back of","ep096"
"50352",1209,"the house I really like it so here we've","ep096"
"50353",1212,"got one bedroom so this is like the","ep096"
"50354",1215,"fourth bedroom this would be your fourth","ep096"
"50355",1218,"bedroom yep I love the high ceilings and","ep096"

"50370",1263,"only living space this is your living","ep096"
"50371",1266,"space yeah okay but the thing I don't","ep096"
"50372",1269,"like is that we're stuck to just this","ep096"
"50373",1272,"one room right well that's where you","ep096"
"50374",1275,"could utilize the room up front you can","ep096"
"50375",1278,"use it as a den or a separate TV room","ep096"
"50376",1281,"but I really wanted it to be our fourth","ep096"
"50377",1284,"bedroom so it's not ideal","ep096"
"50378",1287,"Julie shows them two guest bedrooms and","ep096"

"50385",1308,"details that make a house charming it's","ep096"
"50386",1311,"not cookie cutter would have been really","ep096"

"50388",1317,"the master take a look at that closet","ep096"

"50394",1335,"was gonna continue going back like that","ep096"

"50404",1365,"close to our neighbors there's hardly","ep096"
"50405",1368,"any room yard at all there's really not","ep096"
"50406",1371,"room for a pool I really wanted the big","ep096"
"50407",1374,"yard there's no pool I don't have the","ep096"
"50408",1377,"option of a pool this is kind of","ep096"

"50414",1395,"dream kitchen I love that it's a little","ep096"
"50415",1398,"bungalow I'm just a little concerned","ep096"
"50416",1401,"that it's over budget it's even over","ep096"
"50417",1404,"your budget now it's time for Robert and","ep096"
"50418",1407,"Suzanne to decide which house they want","ep096"
"50419",1410,"they'll have to choose between their","ep096"
"50420",1413,"priorities a big yard four bedrooms or","ep096"
"50421",1416,"the concrete structure four bedroom","ep096"
"50422",1419,"which you know I want the fourth bedroom","ep096"
"50423",1422,"yes big deal","ep096"
"50424",1425,"[Music]","ep096"
"50425",1428,"with a budget of 350,000 dollars Robert","ep096"
"50426",1431,"and Suzanne have looked at several","ep096"
"50427",1434,"different places in the Palm City","ep096"
"50428",1437,"Florida area in the hopes of finding the","ep096"
"50429",1440,"perfect family home now they have to","ep096"
"50430",1443,"make a tough decision the first one is","ep096"
"50431",1446,"the two storey bungalow style house at","ep096"
"50432",1449,"350 its four-bedroom which you know I","ep096"
"50433",1452,"want the fourth bedroom yes big deal and","ep096"
"50434",1455,"I do like that pool area and the big","ep096"
"50435",1458,"backyard and the charm in that house oh","ep096"
"50436",1461,"my goodness","ep096"
"50437",1464,"big time for me in that house was that","ep096"
"50438",1467,"it's a galley kitchen and then it's also","ep096"
"50439",1470,"wood frame there's no hurricane","ep096"
"50440",1473,"protection on that house either so that","ep096"
"50441",1476,"is an additional cost and we're already","ep096"
"50442",1479,"at 350 so let's talk about the ranch","ep096"
"50443",1482,"next at 325 I know you really like the","ep096"
"50444",1485,"way that house log time yeah I do like","ep096"
"50445",1488,"the style I like the big front yard and","ep096"
"50446",1491,"I did have room for the boat","ep096"
"50447",1494,"I like it being open in the kitchen but","ep096"
"50448",1497,"is only a three-bedroom house that was","ep096"
"50449",1500,"not what we were probably looking for","ep096"
"50450",1503,"had a couple ideas or maybe we could add","ep096"
"50451",1506,"a spot that's what frame and it doesn't","ep096"
"50452",1509,"need hurricane protection the price was","ep096"
"50453",1512,"a pro even it was a little more than I","ep096"
"50454",1515,"want to spend maybe that's a compromise","ep096"
"50455",1518,"we can make the pool was beautiful was","ep096"
"50456",1521,"beautiful the Key West bungalow at 360","ep096"
"50457",1524,"you know I like the Key West bungalow","ep096"
"50458",1527,"south loved the idea was concrete block","ep096"
"50459",1530,"yeah huge plus in the kitchen was","ep096"
"50460",1533,"beautiful we just had the one great room","ep096"
"50461",1536,"right one living space but there was the","ep096"
"50462",1539,"ward bedroom so I mean if you're gonna","ep096"
"50463",1542,"you know give and take a little bit","ep096"
"50464",1545,"that's a that's a pretty good compromise","ep096"
"50465",1548,"the yard and the front was a little","ep096"
"50466",1551,"small and the back I really don't feel","ep096"
"50467",1554,"like I had room in the driveway for the","ep096"
"50468",1557,"boat no room for a pool but that one I","ep096"
"50469",1560,"think the price is just a little bit","ep096"
"50470",1563,"high so which one will they choose","ep096"
"50471",1566,"[Music]","ep096"
"50472",1569,"[Applause]","ep096"
"50473",1572,"okay so as much as I love to choose","ep096"
"50474",1575,"story in the fourth bedroom I really","ep096"
"50475",1578,"like that the ranch has the extra living","ep096"
"50476",1581,"space and it has the layout that I love","ep096"
"50477",1584,"so maybe I think the ranch is the best","ep096"
"50478",1587,"way to go okay so we're gonna do this","ep096"
"50479",1590,"yeah I think we should call Jolie","ep096"
"50480",1593,"okay lose it yeah okay what I think is","ep096"
"50481",1596,"after we get done with this why you guys","ep096"
"50482",1599,"should be able to handle this not a","ep096"
"50483",1602,"little taking that we have not moved in","ep096"
"50484",1605,"yet we're still doing some minor","ep096"
"50485",1608,"renovations and we have some more things","ep096"
"50486",1611,"to do each and every time we walk in","ep096"
"50487",1614,"here we have a good feeling we know that","ep096"
"50488",1617,"this was the right house out of that","ep096"
"50489",1620,"this house was listed for 325 and we","ep096"
"50490",1623,"ended up paying 318,000 which was much","ep096"
"50491",1626,"more close to my comfortable budget no","ep096"
"50492",1629,"problems there we painted every every","ep096"
"50493",1632,"wall what's up the kitchen we painted","ep096"
"50494",1635,"the ceilings and we put up beadboard","ep096"
"50495",1638,"wainscoting in the dining room wall we","ep096"
"50496",1641,"did decide to take down the built-in","ep096"
"50497",1644,"shelves around the fireplace underneath","ep096"
"50498",1647,"the shelving there was no flooring so","ep096"

"50592",192,"budget would be eight hundred thousand","ep097"

"50594",198,"what to spend it on they love a","ep097"

"50603",225,"hundred thousand dollars anyway to","ep097"
"50604",228,"recoup some of those expenses would be","ep097"
"50605",231,"really ideal I'm a little nervous about","ep097"
"50606",234,"multifamily homes because while their","ep097"
"50607",237,"income potentials there would be","ep097"
"50608",240,"sacrificing a lot of our privacy I think","ep097"
"50609",243,"right now maybe we're worried about","ep097"
"50610",246,"compromising too much because we're used","ep097"
"50611",249,"to making sacrifices and we really this","ep097"
"50612",252,"should really be our dream home this","ep097"
"50613",255,"would really be a place that we can","ep097"
"50614",258,"settle into it looks like it's a big","ep097"
"50615",261,"yard I personally like the Cape Cod","ep097"
"50616",264,"style houses or ones that kind of have","ep097"
"50617",267,"face like features with the two windows","ep097"
"50618",270,"so it looks kind of unique and funny to","ep097"

"50620",276,"mouth right there looks like I didn't","ep097"

"50622",282,"be a colonial house I like the open","ep097"
"50623",285,"space this is the cramped ceiling you","ep097"
"50624",288,"don't like so much okay looks pretty","ep097"
"50625",291,"cramped my ideal kitchen would be a nice","ep097"
"50626",294,"subway tiles with stainless steel","ep097"
"50627",297,"appliances like that island looks like a","ep097"
"50628",300,"lot of people can gather on that I own","ep097"
"50629",303,"the place","ep097"
"50630",306,"I do like that fridge I actually don't","ep097"
"50631",309,"really like the tile at all the","ep097"
"50632",312,"stainless steel and the white tile just","ep097"
"50633",315,"look very sterile or like maybe so I","ep097"
"50634",318,"don't really like that I like something","ep097"
"50635",321,"more warm maybe warm wooden colors or","ep097"
"50636",324,"country kitchen like if I had my","ep097"
"50637",327,"druthers I've put everything in straw","ep097"

"50642",342,"huge investment and we're hoping we're","ep097"

"50644",348,"[Music]","ep097"
"50645",351,"today I'm showing you a multi-family","ep097"
"50646",354,"house oh it's pretty nice it's built in","ep097"
"50647",357,"the 1838 it's a colonial 38 I looks a","ep097"
"50648",360,"lot newer than that it has three units","ep097"
"50649",363,"three units yes where are they all","ep097"
"50650",366,"hiding there is a unit on the first and","ep097"
"50651",369,"second floor","ep097"
"50652",372,"those are 2-bedroom 1-bath about a","ep097"
"50653",375,"thousand square feet and then the last","ep097"
"50654",378,"unit is in the basement or lower level a","ep097"
"50655",381,"one monitor one bath that would be the","ep097"
"50656",384,"smallest what's the asking price so the","ep097"
"50657",387,"asking price is seven hundred and twenty","ep097"
"50658",390,"thousand oh that's great for three units","ep097"
"50659",393,"yes and it was reduced from seven","ep097"
"50660",396,"hundred and fifty thousand that's","ep097"
"50661",399,"actually making my wallet clear happy","ep097"
"50662",402,"yes I love that it has three units so","ep097"
"50663",405,"there's two potential units for income I","ep097"
"50664",408,"mean we have ten thirteen years of","ep097"
"50665",411,"educational debt to make up for us so","ep097"
"50666",414,"the price is amazing they head up the","ep097"
"50667",417,"stairs to see the second floor unit","ep097"
"50668",420,"first so let's check out the kitchen","ep097"
"50669",423,"Wow I really like this I love this","ep097"
"50670",426,"backsplash it's beautiful Seth likes the","ep097"
"50671",429,"backsplash it's the subway tile but it's","ep097"
"50672",432,"okay you know it's kind of like an","ep097"
"50673",435,"avant-garde version of subway tile it's","ep097"
"50674",438,"not subway tile but is so much better","ep097"
"50675",441,"than that and it's beautiful I love that","ep097"
"50676",444,"agree to disagree","ep097"
"50677",447,"got it so what's next so here is the","ep097"
"50678",450,"living room I like the flooring yeah","ep097"
"50679",453,"really nice you know for the bird for","ep097"
"50680",456,"the plants I think this would be a","ep097"
"50681",459,"really great room I know it's still kind","ep097"
"50682",462,"of cramped out right we still have a lot","ep097"
"50683",465,"of stuff this is something that we have","ep097"
"50684",468,"to though we have to wrestle with","ep097"
"50685",471,"because this is a multi-family we're","ep097"
"50686",474,"saving money it would be like living in","ep097"
"50687",477,"an apartment it's a thousand square feet","ep097"
"50688",480,"remember yeah so let's take a look at","ep097"
"50689",483,"the bathroom this is the one bath for","ep097"
"50690",486,"this apartment this is the only bathroom","ep097"
"50691",489,"for the whole unit right correct every","ep097"
"50692",492,"apartment has one bathroom okay so let's","ep097"
"50693",495,"see the bedrooms","ep097"
"50694",498,"I sense as Stevens really struggling","ep097"
"50695",501,"with it's kind of all or nothing we go","ep097"
"50696",504,"for the multi-family we're gonna save","ep097"
"50697",507,"money we're gonna sacrifice the space","ep097"
"50698",510,"and that kind of privacy the house would","ep097"
"50699",513,"give us all that kind of family value in","ep097"
"50700",516,"that living space that we're looking for","ep097"
"50701",519,"maybe long term we've really are","ep097"
"50702",522,"struggling to kind of figure out where","ep097"
"50703",525,"our priorities are gonna be at this","ep097"
"50704",528,"point then Steven and Stephanie head","ep097"
"50705",531,"downstairs to check out the second","ep097"
"50706",534,"apartment which is an exact replica of a","ep097"
"50707",537,"top floor very very similar to upstairs","ep097"
"50708",540,"surprise it's pretty much the same as","ep097"
"50709",543,"the one appraised exactly well there's a","ep097"
"50710",546,"side door now that goes out to the yard","ep097"
"50711",549,"signage so this works out well for","ep097"
"50712",552,"having a dog yes I would foresee this","ep097"
"50713",555,"being the owners unit just because you","ep097"
"50714",558,"have access to the yard","ep097"
"50715",561,"typical so the tenant will be upstairs","ep097"
"50716",564,"right is it very noisy then the people","ep097"
"50717",567,"upstairs","ep097"
"50718",570,"interviewer the sound downstairs that's","ep097"
"50719",573,"something to consider I'll be right back","ep097"
"50720",576,"run","ep097"
"50721",579,"hey how was that you hear that yes you","ep097"
"50722",582,"can hear and you walk normally","ep097"
"50723",585,"okay wait yeah we're gonna hear it so","ep097"
"50724",588,"that is one of the downsides of having","ep097"
"50725",591,"your units stacked on top of each other","ep097"
"50726",594,"exactly they take a quick look at the","ep097"
"50727",597,"basement level unit then go outside to","ep097"
"50728",600,"see the yard so they come around come in","ep097"
"50729",603,"this way","ep097"
"50730",606,"right exactly they come around from that","ep097"
"50731",609,"side it's a good-size backyard yeah","ep097"
"50732",612,"actually that's good for a dive so","ep097"
"50733",615,"you're George - yeah he could run around","ep097"
"50734",618,"today was really eye-opening you know","ep097"
"50735",621,"it's a newly renovated so it looks","ep097"
"50736",624,"really great inside it has a great","ep097"
"50737",627,"income potential we set our budget at","ep097"
"50738",630,"800,000 and this is 720 and to be able","ep097"
"50739",633,"to have three units it basically just","ep097"
"50740",636,"pay very minimal amount to live in this","ep097"
"50741",639,"space there's a question of when is it","ep097"
"50742",642,"time for us to stop postponing all those","ep097"
"50743",645,"things that we were postponing while we","ep097"
"50744",648,"were training and enjoy the life great","ep097"
"50745",651,"investment but there's a lot that I wish","ep097"
"50746",654,"there was more of do you have any other","ep097"
"50747",657,"places you can look at yes absolutely I","ep097"
"50748",660,"wanted to show you a place where would","ep097"
"50749",663,"be more suitable to your lifestyle as","ep097"
"50750",666,"opposed to investment opportunity okay","ep097"
"50751",669,"absolutely","ep097"
"50752",672,"so now they're meeting their broker at","ep097"
"50753",675,"this single-family sidewall colonial the","ep097"
"50754",678,"asking price is at the top of your rain","ep097"
"50755",681,"relative kindergarten projects edible","ep097"
"50756",684,"marker oh that's awesome","ep097"
"50757",687,"Steven and Stephanie both doctors are in","ep097"
"50758",690,"the market for their first home their","ep097"
"50759",693,"dilemma to spend their $800,000 budget","ep097"
"50760",696,"on an income-producing multi-family to","ep097"
"50761",699,"help them pay off their student debt or","ep097"
"50762",702,"just take the plunge and buy a","ep097"
"50763",705,"single-family home for themselves their","ep097"
"50764",708,"dog and their bird Misha so far they've","ep097"
"50765",711,"seen a well-priced multi-family with","ep097"
"50766",714,"three units it was updated and had a big","ep097"
"50767",717,"yard for their dog but it would mean","ep097"
"50768",720,"they'd have to live in a two-bedroom","ep097"
"50769",723,"one-bath unit with little privacy so now","ep097"
"50770",726,"they've asked to see a single-family","ep097"
"50771",729,"home instead I do like the quiet street","ep097"
"50772",732,"that porch looks like it's gonna be","ep097"
"50773",735,"interesting it's awesome so this is a","ep097"
"50774",738,"three bedroom one and a half bath 1,900","ep097"
"50775",741,"square foot okay the side wall colonial","ep097"
"50776",744,"a lotta charm it was built in 1935 the","ep097"
"50777",747,"asking price is at the top of your range","ep097"
"50778",750,"at $799,000 income potential not here Oh","ep097"
"50779",753,"we'd have to really like this yeah got","ep097"
"50780",756,"it without the potential for rental","ep097"
"50781",759,"income and with our student debt would","ep097"
"50782",762,"be a tough test for me to love it","ep097"
"50783",765,"this is your living room I like the nice","ep097"
"50784",768,"tall ceilings that this feels that makes","ep097"
"50785",771,"it feel so much more spacious so next we","ep097"
"50786",774,"are going to see the sunroom so many","ep097"

"50788",780,"and not fly anywhere else","ep097"
"50789",783,"well close us off a little mesh and then","ep097"

"50836",924,"addition the overall space and the view","ep097"
"50837",927,"is beautiful it is I think the major","ep097"
"50838",930,"thing that we were looking for was for","ep097"
"50839",933,"our to that big backyard with the trees","ep097"
"50840",936,"to offer some shade and just very small","ep097"

"50842",942,"have Lisa will be very happy in the","ep097"
"50843",945,"sunroom the kitchen itself was really","ep097"
"50844",948,"inadequate I really wish that the","ep097"
"50845",951,"kitchen was bigger and this house had an","ep097"
"50846",954,"open concept at $800,000 we're really","ep097"
"50847",957,"stretching our money bin here at this","ep097"
"50848",960,"point I think this house is a good","ep097"
"50849",963,"stepping stone for our first","ep097"
"50850",966,"single-family home there's a lot of","ep097"
"50851",969,"potential and I think we can get used to","ep097"
"50852",972,"some of the aspects of it then we're not","ep097"
"50853",975,"thrilled about it now but I really am","ep097"
"50854",978,"hoping to see other houses that may","ep097"
"50855",981,"fulfill more of our priorities the next","ep097"
"50856",984,"house is also at the top of their budget","ep097"
"50857",987,"but it may give them more bang for the","ep097"
"50858",990,"buck","ep097"
"50859",993,"the yard is 0.26 acres so definitely a","ep097"
"50860",996,"lot of space for our two","ep097"
"50861",999,"[Music]","ep097"
"50862",1002,"dr. Steven and Stephanie have to decide","ep097"
"50863",1005,"of the home they want to buy in","ep097"
"50864",1008,"Westchester New York should be a single","ep097"
"50865",1011,"family place just for themselves or an","ep097"
"50866",1014,"income-producing multi-family that would","ep097"
"50867",1017,"help them pay off their student loans","ep097"
"50868",1020,"working with an $800,000 budget they've","ep097"
"50869",1023,"seen a well-priced multi-family home","ep097"
"50870",1026,"that would mean rental income for them","ep097"
"50871",1029,"but tight living quarters then they saw","ep097"
"50872",1032,"a more spacious single-family with","ep097"
"50873",1035,"attractive features but it was at the","ep097"
"50874",1038,"top of their budget and the yard was","ep097"
"50875",1041,"small so now their brokers lined up","ep097"
"50876",1044,"another single-family home this time","ep097"
"50877",1047,"with a bigger yard Cape Cod houses I","ep097"
"50878",1050,"always see faces of them this one with","ep097"
"50879",1053,"the bay window looks like the left eye","ep097"
"50880",1056,"has a black eye and then the big eye","ep097"
"50881",1059,"here in the nose I really don't want to","ep097"
"50882",1062,"live in a house with that face the yard","ep097"
"50883",1065,"is 0.26 acres so definitely a lot of","ep097"
"50884",1068,"space for our two in the price this is","ep097"
"50885",1071,"asking $7.99 so again the top of your","ep097"
"50886",1074,"budget but you know what it came down","ep097"
"50887",1077,"from 879 so it seems like the sellers","ep097"
"50888",1080,"are motivated and I bet you there's a","ep097"
"50889",1083,"chance to get it at a lower price okay","ep097"
"50890",1086,"so let's check it out and say oh wow a","ep097"
"50891",1089,"little bit low I think you definitely","ep097"
"50892",1092,"touch the ceilings it's not all compact","ep097"
"50893",1095,"little claustrophobic I mean I guess","ep097"
"50894",1098,"that's the Cape the compact miss of the","ep097"
"50895",1101,"Cape I don't mind it because I'm 5 feet","ep097"
"50896",1104,"but it does feel very open so the","ep097"
"50897",1107,"kitchen's been updated you could see","ep097"
"50898",1110,"there's granite countertops there's some","ep097"
"50899",1113,"stainless steel appliances","ep097"
"50900",1116,"I like the subway tile I actually missed","ep097"
"50901",1119,"the subway tile because I saw the warm","ep097"
"50902",1122,"wood paneling of the cabinet's so","ep097"
"50903",1125,"professionally it's somehow compromises","ep097"
"50904",1128,"it's a good fit for what we both like","ep097"
"50905",1131,"cuz I don't mind the subway tile is so","ep097"
"50906",1134,"much it has the illusion of being open","ep097"
"50907",1137,"with the blue one over here but I still","ep097"
"50908",1140,"feel kind of cramped in here they check","ep097"
"50909",1143,"out the first-floor bathroom a guest","ep097"
"50910",1146,"bedroom","ep097"

"50915",1161,"the one bathroom up on this level okay","ep097"
"50916",1164,"it's a nice blue color what do you think","ep097"
"50917",1167,"of the blue I should really like it yeah","ep097"
"50918",1170,"it's very calming that's a nice calming","ep097"
"50919",1173,"effect down the hall from the bathroom","ep097"
"50920",1176,"is the master bedroom this is the master","ep097"
"50921",1179,"bedroom because it has a lot of closets","ep097"

"50932",1212,"a bar is maybe a little too excessive it","ep097"

"50970",1326,"most important an income-producing","ep097"
"50971",1329,"property a big backyard or high ceilings","ep097"

"50979",1353,"they've seen several options now they","ep097"

"50981",1359,"the multifamily colonial $720,000 you","ep097"
"50982",1362,"can't be there for three units we'd be","ep097"
"50983",1365,"able to pay off our loans so much faster","ep097"
"50984",1368,"we'd be sacrificing a lot of our privacy","ep097"
"50985",1371,"right yeah that's the multi-family","ep097"
"50986",1374,"that's what we're giving up they'd be","ep097"
"50987",1377,"noisy in the first floor and then you'd","ep097"
"50988",1380,"be making noise for people downstairs","ep097"
"50989",1383,"the kitchens are small yes the rooms are","ep097"
"50990",1386,"small it would be more just for us yeah","ep097"
"50991",1389,"the one with the double porches that","ep097"
"50992",1392,"side colonial that was for $7.99 799","ep097"

"50997",1407,"you know we could definitely live there","ep097"
"50998",1410,"for more than 10 years it would be more","ep097"

"51032",1512,"entirely our own so ultimately we chose","ep097"

"51262",612,"too steep for what I'm willing to pay","ep098"

"51264",618,"really happy to be just three or four","ep098"

"51266",624,"too far from the beach it turns out I","ep098"

"51316",774,"that it's absolutely perfect it's","ep098"
"51317",777,"definitely not my style","ep098"
"51318",780,"it's still about 10-15 minutes from the","ep098"

"51335",831,"wasn't expecting this I love it","ep098"
"51336",834,"definitely different from the outside","ep098"
"51337",837,"obviously they've done a little bit of","ep098"
"51338",840,"work internally could just be a little","ep098"
"51339",843,"bit small for my liking reminds me of","ep098"
"51340",846,"kind of a little English place I love it","ep098"
"51341",849,"I love the mix of the sort of character","ep098"
"51342",852,"on the outside but then instead of a","ep098"
"51343",855,"modern finish on the inside to the","ep098"
"51344",858,"modern kitchen suits me down to the","ep098"
"51345",861,"ground the modern kitchen is perfect","ep098"

"51358",900,"this is a bit the only thing that","ep098"
"51359",903,"probably needs to be finished on the","ep098"
"51360",906,"property guys to the left we've got","ep098"
"51361",909,"another bedroom this is exactly what I","ep098"

"51488",1290,"like a little bit bigger but having said","ep098"
"51489",1293,"that I do like that it feeds out into","ep098"
"51490",1296,"the outdoor space so probably really","ep098"
"51491",1299,"good for entertaining and BBQs that kind","ep098"
"51492",1302,"of thing you've also got the breakfast","ep098"

"51524",1398,"outside exactly what I'm looking for in","ep098"
"51525",1401,"a house","ep098"
"51526",1404,"it is lovely but it doesn't have the","ep098"
"51527",1407,"character that I'm really looking for","ep098"
"51528",1410,"and it's really far out from the city","ep098"

"51534",1428,"moving over here and really want to","ep098"
"51535",1431,"compromise beautiful with this it's","ep098"

"51543",1455,"she sacrificed a lot and has her own","ep098"
"51544",1458,"ideas about what will make the move","ep098"
"51545",1461,"worth why high ceilings and a polished","ep098"
"51546",1464,"floor this is exactly what I had in mind","ep098"
"51547",1467,"and that garden was just available it's","ep098"
"51548",1470,"a good-sized yard and the house is large","ep098"
"51549",1473,"but it's not something that suits me","ep098"
"51550",1476,"definitely not that modern feel that I'm","ep098"
"51551",1479,"really looking for there's way over","ep098"
"51552",1482,"budget I like this I love the mix of the","ep098"
"51553",1485,"character on the outside but there's a","ep098"
"51554",1488,"modern finish on the inside just a","ep098"
"51555",1491,"little bit small for my liking it was","ep098"
"51556",1494,"under budget still too far from the","ep098"
"51557",1497,"beach the modern beach house was right","ep098"
"51558",1500,"up my alley","ep098"
"51559",1503,"ten minutes walk from the beach put in","ep098"
"51560",1506,"your budgets we have 1,400 a month it's","ep098"
"51561",1509,"exactly what I want it's just really not","ep098"
"51562",1512,"what I had in mind at all modern is","ep098"
"51563",1515,"exactly what you can get in England and","ep098"
"51564",1518,"it's really far out from the city","ep098"
"51565",1521,"[Music]","ep098"
"51566",1524,"I can't believe how stressful this has","ep098"
"51567",1527,"been moving over here and looking at all","ep098"
"51568",1530,"these different houses they're all got","ep098"
"51569",1533,"so much to offer it it has been really","ep098"
"51570",1536,"really hard I think we really need to","ep098"
"51571",1539,"rule the house up yeah I think it would","ep098"
"51572",1542,"make the decision easier I'm thinking","ep098"
"51573",1545,"it's got to be the classic green thunder","ep098"
"51574",1548,"just because even though the yards","ep098"
"51575",1551,"amazing and it's a really good size I","ep098"
"51576",1554,"just don't think it's a good idea to go","ep098"
"51577",1557,"over budget at the state","ep098"
"51578",1560,"I totally agree I know it was the","ep098"
"51579",1563,"biggest house with the biggest yard but","ep098"
"51580",1566,"we definitely don't have the money to be","ep098"
"51581",1569,"spending yet so that leaves us with two","ep098"
"51582",1572,"yeah well you know which one's my","ep098"
"51583",1575,"favorite I love that small Queens on","ep098"
"51584",1578,"there I really do I like the combination","ep098"
"51585",1581,"of the Queensland style plus the modern","ep098"
"51586",1584,"fittings and the location is so great I","ep098"
"51587",1587,"could tell you that one but I really do","ep098"

"51589",1593,"perfect for I want the air conditioning","ep098"
"51590",1596,"the big yard entertaining area I think","ep098"
"51591",1599,"it's exactly what we need","ep098"
"51592",1602,"being so close to the beach in that Jeep","ep098"
"51593",1605,"that was a big sell for me but the","ep098"
"51594",1608,"location is an ideal for me I don't","ep098"
"51595",1611,"really want to be commuting too far and","ep098"
"51596",1614,"that's more Queens under been so close","ep098"
"51597",1617,"to the city would leave us a lot more","ep098"
"51598",1620,"free time to be enjoying the Aussie","ep098"
"51599",1623,"lifestyle but I know how much you want","ep098"

"51725",276,"kitchen would be really nice and I","ep099"

"51728",285,"you looking from a budget point of view","ep099"
"51729",288,"our budget is a thousand dollars a month","ep099"

"51734",303,"stay at a thousand dollars if we can I","ep099"
"51735",306,"kind I think it should be fairly easy to","ep099"
"51736",309,"find a job so we could go over a little","ep099"
"51737",312,"bit Kevin and Lee want to leave all","ep099"
"51738",315,"right where the universities or","ep099"

"51740",321,"this is Lee's picked this is near the","ep099"
"51741",324,"water so it's about 15 20 minutes to the","ep099"
"51742",327,"University but with what Lee wants it's","ep099"
"51743",330,"five minutes from the city couple of","ep099"
"51744",333,"minutes from the water area I love all","ep099"
"51745",336,"these trees and nice and close to the","ep099"
"51746",339,"water but I think it might be a little","ep099"
"51747",342,"far from the Uni it wouldn't hurt to","ep099"
"51748",345,"ride the BOC would it back and forth","ep099"
"51749",348,"hey so I think I'd be a puddle of sweat","ep099"

"51756",369,"per month","ep099"
"51757",372,"not too bad it's a bit more than I was","ep099"

"51759",378,"savings and is willing to dip into them","ep099"
"51760",381,"I feel bad","ep099"
"51761",384,"dipping into her savings and not","ep099"

"51800",501,"away from the University and it's also a","ep099"
"51801",504,"bit over the budget that we are hoping","ep099"
"51802",507,"to spend so yeah but we don't want to","ep099"
"51803",510,"rule it out quite yet the area is","ep099"

"51816",549,"furnitures a bit plain couch is a bit","ep099"
"51817",552,"worn out I guess that's why it's under","ep099"

"51826",579,"and stingrays the Great Barrier Reef is","ep099"
"51827",582,"kind of the marine biology dream we've","ep099"

"51983",1050,"to do much better than that no it just","ep099"
"51984",1053,"seems like it should be even more under","ep099"
"51985",1056,"budget if it's that far away from town","ep099"
"51986",1059,"it's just a 10-minute bike ride every","ep099"
"51987",1062,"day that's nothing","ep099"
"51988",1065,"if we put that apartment closer to the","ep099"

"52005",1116,"that she really really loves and it's a","ep099"

"52007",1122,"compromise Kevin Lee are looking for I","ep099"

"52009",1128,"something that's in the city where Kevin","ep099"
"52010",1131,"wants something that's close to the","ep099"

"52016",1149,"minutes away from the beach that is a","ep099"
"52017",1152,"bit far out from the beach yeah it does","ep099"
"52018",1155,"kind of feel like a homey neighborhood","ep099"
"52019",1158,"though so here we are okay is it the","ep099"
"52020",1161,"ground floor the top floor you like","ep099"

"52026",1179,"all right this looks really modern seems","ep099"
"52027",1182,"really homey","ep099"
"52028",1185,"quite large too I really like the","ep099"
"52029",1188,"windows get lots of natural light in","ep099"
"52030",1191,"here too furniture is actually really","ep099"
"52031",1194,"nice wow this kitchen is huge look at","ep099"
"52032",1197,"all the covers oh never run out of","ep099"
"52033",1200,"storage space in here now this is what I","ep099"
"52034",1203,"call a nice modern kitchen oh here we go","ep099"
"52035",1206,"it might be a little bit small it's not","ep099"
"52036",1209,"that big is it it's not a lot of room","ep099"
"52037",1212,"for anything else than what's already in","ep099"
"52038",1215,"here yeah I wouldn't get much furniture","ep099"
"52039",1218,"in here","ep099"
"52040",1221,"really not a lot of space in here really","ep099"
"52041",1224,"tiny countertops pretty small and","ep099"
"52042",1227,"there's not a lot of storage in here","ep099"
"52043",1230,"it's really not that big of a bathroom","ep099"
"52044",1233,"shower looks really nice though I think","ep099"
"52045",1236,"I was more concerned about how small the","ep099"
"52046",1239,"bathroom was he thought it didn't really","ep099"
"52047",1242,"matter as much oh wow I haven't see art","ep099"
"52048",1245,"is huge this is a cute little table yeah","ep099"
"52049",1248,"I really like the flow from the kitchen","ep099"
"52050",1251,"right out onto the patio this would be a","ep099"
"52051",1254,"great place to eat meals together yeah","ep099"
"52052",1257,"definitely why don't we share this yard","ep099"
"52053",1260,"okay yes you do so obviously the","ep099"
"52054",1263,"balconies upstairs but you've got all","ep099"
"52055",1266,"down here so who does all the yard work","ep099"
"52056",1269,"then body is by me okay what do you","ep099"
"52057",1272,"think of the whole place I mean first","ep099"
"52058",1275,"impressions walking in it was WOW","ep099"
"52059",1278,"like this is really modern looks like","ep099"
"52060",1281,"it's been totally redone everything","ep099"
"52061",1284,"looks brand-new it's really nowhere near","ep099"
"52062",1287,"the University and it's still quite a","ep099"
"52063",1290,"bit far from the beach too and a little","ep099"
"52064",1293,"bit further from town than I think I'd","ep099"
"52065",1296,"like it to be I think you would like it","ep099"
"52066",1299,"if it maybe had a pool too yeah there's","ep099"
"52067",1302,"no pool here and it is over budget I can","ep099"
"52068",1305,"see why Martin brought us here it's a","ep099"
"52069",1308,"really modern unit and it's got a lot of","ep099"
"52070",1311,"the interior features that we were","ep099"
"52071",1314,"looking for price of this unit is a","ep099"
"52072",1317,"little bit more than we want to spend","ep099"
"52073",1320,"that much over budget though","ep099"
"52074",1323,"but for somewhere that's far from the","ep099"
"52075",1326,"University and also far from the beach","ep099"
"52076",1329,"not sure if we'd be worth it if we got","ep099"
"52077",1332,"the one by the beach would be so close","ep099"
"52078",1335,"all the restaurants and shopping areas I","ep099"
"52079",1338,"think we might be thinking a little bit","ep099"
"52080",1341,"like tourists wanting to live close to","ep099"
"52081",1344,"the beach and the attractive area of","ep099"
"52082",1347,"town where we really should be thinking","ep099"
"52083",1350,"about something that's gonna be","ep099"
"52084",1353,"convenient for our everyday lives this","ep099"
"52085",1356,"is so crazy I think we can just come","ep099"
"52086",1359,"down and go for a walk along the ocean","ep099"
"52087",1362,"Kevin and Lee came to Townsville so","ep099"
"52088",1365,"Kevin could study marine biology but Lee","ep099"
"52089",1368,"isn't about to give up on what she wants","ep099"
"52090",1371,"out of Australia keV just a","ep099"
"52091",1374,"to get an abode and go do research","ep099"
"52092",1377,"whereas I expect more to be able to live","ep099"
"52093",1380,"somewhere that's close to the beach and","ep099"
"52094",1383,"relax","ep099"
"52095",1386,"I'd really like to stick with the budget","ep099"
"52096",1389,"we could dip into lee's savings but i'd","ep099"
"52097",1392,"rather save that and live really close","ep099"
"52098",1395,"to university what did you think about","ep099"
"52099",1398,"the one by the beach","ep099"
"52100",1401,"I liked that one I mean the view over","ep099"
"52101",1404,"the water was great such a great I","ep099"
"52102",1407,"really loved the view on that balcony","ep099"
"52103",1410,"it's so close to the beach and all the","ep099"
"52104",1413,"shops I really liked it although it did","ep099"
"52105",1416,"come in over our budget I'd really like","ep099"
"52106",1419,"to stay within the thousand dollars that","ep099"
"52107",1422,"we were planning to spend originally","ep099"
"52108",1425,"what did you think about the one by the","ep099"
"52109",1428,"University I really like that one I mean","ep099"
"52110",1431,"really convenient to get to school it's","ep099"
"52111",1434,"living areas awesome furnitures a bit","ep099"
"52112",1437,"plain I'm really happy about how close","ep099"
"52113",1440,"it is to the University because it'll","ep099"
"52114",1443,"make my life so much easier yeah came in","ep099"
"52115",1446,"under budget $900 a month that's true","ep099"
"52116",1449,"was definitely under our budget I don't","ep099"
"52117",1452,"know it just seems like it should be","ep099"
"52118",1455,"even more under budget if it's that far","ep099"
"52119",1458,"away from town","ep099"
"52120",1461,"just think of that really modern one","ep099"
"52121",1464,"that looks like it been recently redone","ep099"
"52122",1467,"that was beautiful I really like that","ep099"
"52123",1470,"one it's really hoping the concept seems","ep099"
"52124",1473,"really homey quite large - I was really","ep099"
"52125",1476,"blown away when we first walked in it's","ep099"
"52126",1479,"so modern the living area is fantastic","ep099"
"52127",1482,"has this a really natural flow to it and","ep099"
"52128",1485,"feels like a home already it's just","ep099"
"52129",1488,"walking in there's nice and big you guys","ep099"
"52130",1491,"have a patio and barbecue back there","ep099"
"52131",1494,"friends but we're sharing it with the","ep099"
"52132",1497,"upstairs neighbors it's not close to the","ep099"
"52133",1500,"beach","ep099"
"52134",1503,"and it's not close to the University and","ep099"
"52135",1506,"it came in at $1,100 if you put it by","ep099"
"52136",1509,"the beach I'd be ready to move in and if","ep099"
"52137",1512,"you plopped it down by the university","ep099"
"52138",1515,"keV would be ready to move in so I'm","ep099"
"52139",1518,"just not really sure if the location","ep099"
"52140",1521,"makes sense for us but the property just","ep099"
"52141",1524,"blew us away","ep099"
"52142",1527,"[Music]","ep099"
"52143",1530,"that really modern ones really not close","ep099"
"52144",1533,"to the beach or the University and it's","ep099"
"52145",1536,"hundred dollars over a budget","ep099"
"52146",1539,"yeah I'm really not sure if it's worth","ep099"
"52147",1542,"going over our budget yeah I agree","ep099"
"52148",1545,"despite how much we really love the","ep099"
"52149",1548,"interior I think I'd probably eliminate","ep099"
"52150",1551,"that one yeah let's do that so there's","ep099"
"52151",1554,"two left we've got the one by the","ep099"
"52152",1557,"University and we've got the one by the","ep099"
"52153",1560,"beach what do you think I think we","ep099"
"52154",1563,"should take the one by the beach that","ep099"
"52155",1566,"one was nice but how often are we really","ep099"
"52156",1569,"gonna go to the beach the one by the","ep099"
"52157",1572,"university would be convenient for","ep099"
"52158",1575,"everyday life but if we took the one by","ep099"
"52159",1578,"the beach we could come walk down here","ep099"
"52160",1581,"all the time have a nice glass of wine","ep099"
"52161",1584,"on that patio the one by the beach is","ep099"
"52162",1587,"$100 a month over budget yeah it is a","ep099"
"52163",1590,"little bit over budget but it wasn't","ep099"
"52164",1593,"that much over budget I think we might","ep099"
"52165",1596,"be thinking a little bit like tourists","ep099"
"52166",1599,"wanting to live close to the beach and","ep099"
"52167",1602,"the attractive area of town where we","ep099"
"52168",1605,"really should be thinking about","ep099"
"52169",1608,"something that's gonna be convenient for","ep099"
"52170",1611,"our everyday lives","ep099"
"52171",1614,"and hey the pool oh I did love that pool","ep099"
"52172",1617,"you're probably gonna make better use of","ep099"
"52173",1620,"the pool and the one by the university","ep099"
"52174",1623,"than the one by the beach if we got the","ep099"
"52175",1626,"one by the beach would be so close to","ep099"
"52176",1629,"all the restaurants and shopping areas I","ep099"
"52177",1632,"just think being by the beach","ep099"
"52178",1635,"might not really be as important as we","ep099"
"52179",1638,"think it is we're not gonna be going to","ep099"
"52180",1641,"the beach every day I think we should go","ep099"
"52181",1644,"for the one by the University but I want","ep099"
"52182",1647,"you to be happy so I throw it to you","ep099"
"52183",1650,"whichever one you want I did really love","ep099"

"52478",792,"between here and Philly is important but","ep100"
"52479",795,"at the same time I really wanted a","ep100"
"52480",798,"change","ep100"

"52493",837,"Courtney mode has high hopes for her","ep100"
"52494",840,"move to Rome","ep100"

"52507",879,"thinks living in a small city apartment","ep100"
"52508",882,"is worth trying she understands that","ep100"
"52509",885,"we're doing this for her initially I've","ep100"
"52510",888,"always been in a stable job so Dave is","ep100"

"52515",903,"and have more fun that's interesting","ep100"
"52516",906,"and I think if we don't find the place","ep100"
"52517",909,"that is comfortable for us we don't want","ep100"
"52518",912,"to be adding a layer of stress that","ep100"

"52520",918,"you want to try to be fun no thank you","ep100"

"52524",930,"them when Courtney wants to downsize","ep100"
"52525",933,"it's just too much space Dave I mean","ep100"

"52527",939,"thinks a rare find in the heart of Rome","ep100"
"52528",942,"could be what they're both looking for","ep100"
"52529",945,"city life and space I think that these","ep100"
"52530",948,"apartment matches all their requests it","ep100"

"52565",1053,"apartment gives us a really great","ep100"
"52566",1056,"compromise","ep100"
"52567",1059,"it gives Dave the space that he was","ep100"
"52568",1062,"looking for but it's still smaller than","ep100"
"52569",1065,"what we had in the United States so I","ep100"
"52570",1068,"feel like I am downsizing a little yet","ep100"
"52571",1071,"it's in this amazing location you can","ep100"
"52572",1074,"really see that you're in the center of","ep100"
"52573",1077,"Rome through these big windows it's","ep100"
"52574",1080,"great so what about these stairs what is","ep100"
"52575",1083,"this the terrace","ep100"
"52576",1086,"Wow this is incredible","ep100"
"52577",1089,"you're the forum it's it's just unreal","ep100"
"52578",1092,"this is really incredible I could","ep100"
"52579",1095,"absolutely come out to this every day I","ep100"
"52580",1098,"think it would be an incredible addition","ep100"
"52581",1101,"to the space inside a little oasis in","ep100"
"52582",1104,"the heart of room as an apartment I can","ep100"
"52583",1107,"consider something like this but I don't","ep100"
"52584",1110,"know if I can get over that budget I","ep100"
"52585",1113,"think it's actually worth splurging on","ep100"
"52586",1116,"the budget which I'm surprised to hear","ep100"
"52587",1119,"myself say that just when agreement","ep100"
"52588",1122,"seems to be in reach it still proves","ep100"
"52589",1125,"elusive it has the exact feel from","ep100"
"52590",1128,"living in Europe that I was looking for","ep100"
"52591",1131,"so you know the penthouse is also a way","ep100"
"52592",1134,"over our budget old-world streets that","ep100"
"52593",1137,"we're actually moving here","ep100"
"52594",1140,"Courtenay may still be in awe but now","ep100"
"52595",1143,"it's a reality we've really got to make","ep100"
"52596",1146,"a decision on where we're gonna live","ep100"
"52597",1149,"after 10 years of dreaming about it the","ep100"
"52598",1152,"Stars finally aligned to where she could","ep100"
"52599",1155,"convince her husband to move their whole","ep100"
"52600",1158,"family abroad this was my idea so really","ep100"
"52601",1161,"at the end of the day I feel all the","ep100"
"52602",1164,"pressure all the load but they have yet","ep100"
"52603",1167,"to align on which house to live in the","ep100"
"52604",1170,"home is the foundation so we want a","ep100"
"52605",1173,"place that were ultimately all happy","ep100"
"52606",1176,"living it","ep100"
"52607",1179,"house one perfectly fit Courtney's","ep100"
"52608",1182,"desire to downsize it had a great","ep100"
"52609",1185,"outdoor space we can let the dog out","ep100"
"52610",1188,"here the kid can play out here and was","ep100"
"52611",1191,"way under budget three thousand and five","ep100"
"52612",1194,"hundred dollars the price is great Dave","ep100"
"52613",1197,"liked it but thought the smaller space","ep100"
"52614",1200,"left no room for privacy it's nice but","ep100"
"52615",1203,"it's very small to be overall could you","ep100"
"52616",1206,"imagine cooking Thanksgiving dinner in","ep100"
"52617",1209,"here no I could house to put them back","ep100"
"52618",1212,"in the suburbs in an up sized house that","ep100"
"52619",1215,"made Dave feel much more comfortable","ep100"
"52620",1218,"this is the space that I was looking I","ep100"
"52621",1221,"love to see the over looking from the","ep100"
"52622",1224,"kitchen into the room but the immense","ep100"
"52623",1227,"space made Kourtney's head spin that","ep100"
"52624",1230,"means the house is too big Wow too much","ep100"
"52625",1233,"space Dave this is you know it's","ep100"
"52626",1236,"downsizing it at all","ep100"
"52627",1239,"house 3 offered good space in the heart","ep100"
"52628",1242,"of Rome this is incredible but the price","ep100"
"52629",1245,"forty six hundred for it well okay so","ep100"
"52630",1248,"that is quite a bit over our budget","ep100"
"52631",1251,"[Music]","ep100"
"52632",1254,"the first one now I just don't think","ep100"
"52633",1257,"that I want to live in is the","ep100"
"52634",1260,"ground-floor apartment yeah it was small","ep100"
"52635",1263,"and we're all gonna be on top of each","ep100"
"52636",1266,"other I just don't know if that","ep100"
"52637",1269,"apartments gonna give us what we need","ep100"
"52638",1272,"I'm in agreement with you so you know","ep100"
"52639",1275,"with the townhouse I love the pool I","ep100"
"52640",1278,"didn't expect that we'd be able to get","ep100"
"52641",1281,"one it's gonna give me something to do","ep100"
"52642",1284,"in the summer with the kids plus we have","ep100"
"52643",1287,"all that space so for me with the","ep100"
"52644",1290,"townhouse it's not an allocation I had","ep100"
"52645",1293,"envisioned at all when we thought about","ep100"
"52646",1296,"moving to Europe","ep100"
"52647",1299,"there's no Piazza it really doesn't have","ep100"
"52648",1302,"that European feel plus it's so big I","ep100"
"52649",1305,"really wanted to downsize it definitely","ep100"
"52650",1308,"makes me feel more comfortable okay the","ep100"
"52651",1311,"penthouse it has the exact feel for","ep100"
"52652",1314,"living in Europe that I was looking for","ep100"
"52653",1317,"the room sizes were all really good the","ep100"
"52654",1320,"kitchen was actually plenty big so you","ep100"
"52655",1323,"know the penthouse is also way over our","ep100"
"52656",1326,"budget yeah you're right about that so","ep100"
"52657",1329,"I'm just really torn I know you really","ep100"
"52658",1332,"want that penthouse you know it really","ep100"
"52659",1335,"just has the best of both worlds I feel","ep100"
"52660",1338,"like for our family","ep100"
"52661",1341,"but I know how reluctant you were about","ep100"
"52662",1344,"this whole move and I saw how","ep100"
"52663",1347,"comfortable you are in that townhouse so","ep100"
"52664",1350,"I feel like you know I'm okay to let you","ep100"
"52665",1353,"get what you want with where we live Wow","ep100"
"52666",1356,"I did not expect you to come around like","ep100"
"52667",1359,"that I just I know I saw your face we're","ep100"
"52668",1362,"at the the penthouse and I just I","ep100"
"52669",1365,"figured that was gonna be what you","ep100"
"52670",1368,"wanted so thank you this is one of my","ep100"
"52671",1371,"favorite things to do in Rome ruins of","ep100"
"52672",1374,"the ancient civilization and this is a","ep100"
"52673",1377,"church from the medieval times this was","ep100"
"52674",1380,"a quite a change for us and I think I've","ep100"
"52675",1383,"adjusted pretty well see how that used","ep100"
"52676",1386,"to be a dome","ep100"
"52677",1389,"yes I'm happy that we made the move just","ep100"
"52678",1392,"because the experiences that we've had","ep100"
"52679",1395,"so far every weekend we really try to","ep100"
"52680",1398,"plan something to do that we wouldn't","ep100"
"52681",1401,"get to take advantage of if we were","ep100"
"52682",1404,"still living in the United States","ep100"
"52683",1407,"all right who's gonna get first yeah D","ep100"

"52687",1419,"we've taken the smaller bedroom on the","ep100"
"52688",1422,"third floor which has the bathroom so","ep100"
"52689",1425,"it's kind of been a like a little sweet","ep100"
"52690",1428,"for us and it's worked out well in Rome","ep100"

"52773",240,"little work this is the type of","ep101"
"52774",243,"neighborhood you just walk everywhere","ep101"
"52775",246,"coffee shops gonna be right in the","ep101"
"52776",249,"corner and get out of your hair and it","ep101"
"52777",252,"nice to be close to parks nerd thing I'm","ep101"

"52779",258,"everything so one of my favorite things","ep101"
"52780",261,"to do is without the kids and just walk","ep101"
"52781",264,"to a coffee shop go grab a cup of coffee","ep101"
"52782",267,"so that's that's a huge thing I mean of","ep101"

"53373",486,"would be worth the cost","ep102"
"53374",489,"do you have something that might be a","ep102"
"53375",492,"little more on budget I'm concerned that","ep102"
"53376",495,"she loves this place so much especially","ep102"
"53377",498,"since this is the first property that","ep102"
"53378",501,"we've seen every property you see after","ep102"

"53409",594,"looking in their dream city making that","ep102"

"53646",1305,"[Music]","ep102"
"53647",1308,"it's so peaceful here it's a nice slice","ep102"

"53655",1332,"before you do anything else I want my","ep102"
"53656",1335,"children to be comfortable so I am","ep102"
"53657",1338,"willing to spend a little bit more I am","ep102"
"53658",1341,"coming to Taiwan with no job and I care","ep102"
"53659",1344,"a lot more about the price then Cecilia","ep102"
"53660",1347,"does so what do you think of the city","ep102"
"53661",1350,"apartment it had everything that I","ep102"

"53664",1359,"place is gorgeous it doesn't have an","ep102"
"53665",1362,"office though it's also way over our","ep102"
"53666",1365,"budget well what did you think about the","ep102"
"53667",1368,"apartment with the office that one was","ep102"
"53668",1371,"still over budget but a little closer","ep102"
"53669",1374,"and the location was great too there's","ep102"
"53670",1377,"only five minutes the public","ep102"
"53671",1380,"transportation and schools but","ep102"
"53672",1383,"unfortunately this case it doesn't equip","ep102"
"53673",1386,"with the dishwasher it's just not quite","ep102"
"53674",1389,"my taste that apartment have a","ep102"
"53675",1392,"hodgepodge of different kinds of","ep102"
"53676",1395,"furniture but it's leather and it's","ep102"
"53677",1398,"gonna be much easier to clean the city","ep102"
"53678",1401,"apartment what about the apartment with","ep102"
"53679",1404,"the swimming pool I can definitely see","ep102"
"53680",1407,"our kids using this all the time I like","ep102"
"53681",1410,"the fact that it had a fourth bedroom","ep102"
"53682",1413,"for my office it's also right on budget","ep102"
"53683",1416,"all right but does it also have a washer","ep102"
"53684",1419,"and dryer too I'll butcher you know this","ep102"
"53685",1422,"is it for the kitchen and worry about","ep102"
"53686",1425,"cooking in there plus it's kind of far","ep102"
"53687",1428,"from","ep102"
"53688",1431,"forgot about that part 20 minutes away","ep102"
"53689",1434,"that's a long hike every single day so","ep102"
"53690",1437,"is it safe to say that we could cross","ep102"
"53691",1440,"out the swimming pool apartment I think","ep102"
"53692",1443,"that's right","ep102"
"53693",1446,"I can't imagine walking 20 minutes every","ep102"
"53694",1449,"day each way to drop the kids off and","ep102"
"53695",1452,"get real real soon we're down to the","ep102"
"53696",1455,"city apartment and the office apartment","ep102"
"53697",1458,"kind of love the city apartment it's so","ep102"
"53698",1461,"spacious there's so much light that","ep102"
"53699",1464,"comes in the view it I mean it's","ep102"
"53700",1467,"gorgeous","ep102"
"53701",1470,"yeah but how often are you actually","ep102"
"53702",1473,"gonna use the view if we pick the office","ep102"
"53703",1476,"apartment I'm gonna use the office","ep102"
"53704",1479,"pretty much every single day but you","ep102"
"53705",1482,"know what we would probably use every","ep102"
"53706",1485,"single day the dishwasher and that large","ep102"
"53707",1488,"laundry room but it's so expensive and I","ep102"
"53708",1491,"don't have a job right now so I think","ep102"
"53709",1494,"that's gonna be tough the office","ep102"
"53710",1497,"apartment it offers the best of both","ep102"
"53711",1500,"worlds it checks off a lot of our","ep102"
"53712",1503,"wishlist items it's close by to the","ep102"
"53713",1506,"schools a price that's closer to our","ep102"
"53714",1509,"budget well I guess it might make more","ep102"
"53715",1512,"sense even if I do have to give up my","ep102"
"53716",1515,"dishwasher so you're okay with office","ep102"
"53717",1518,"apartment I think so I mean I think it's","ep102"

"54014",837,"train tracks right correct does that","ep103"
"54015",840,"mean we're close to the subway so","ep103"
"54016",843,"unfortunately there is no subway around","ep103"
"54017",846,"here but you are two blocks from a major","ep103"
"54018",849,"bus line that will take you downtown one","ep103"
"54019",852,"of the things I'm not so sure about is","ep103"
"54020",855,"moving out of the South Loop we've been","ep103"
"54021",858,"in our current neighborhood for almost a","ep103"
"54022",861,"decade so that would be an adjustment","ep103"

"54024",867,"you know I love the layout of it I love","ep103"
"54025",870,"this nice big Center Island","ep103"
"54026",873,"but you know I have to say obviously","ep103"

"54031",888,"could always install though yourself you","ep103"
"54032",891,"know you are significantly underneath","ep103"
"54033",894,"your budget yeah and no backsplash is","ep103"
"54034",897,"better than an ugly backsplash true","ep103"
"54035",900,"right around the corner they walk into","ep103"
"54036",903,"the master suite this is way bigger than","ep103"
"54037",906,"our current bedroom in fact we'd","ep103"
"54038",909,"probably have to buy some other","ep103"
"54039",912,"furniture in order to fill up this space","ep103"
"54040",915,"yeah I think so this bathroom is great","ep103"
"54041",918,"yeah it's got the double vanities","ep103"

"54045",930,"this one's actually pretty big yeah it","ep103"
"54046",933,"looks like we might have some room for","ep103"

"54054",957,"exactly what I was looking for and I","ep103"
"54055",960,"laughed I happen to like the fact that","ep103"
"54056",963,"it's a lot of square footage and it does","ep103"
"54057",966,"come with deeded parking included in the","ep103"
"54058",969,"price is not an additional twenty or","ep103"
"54059",972,"thirty thousand dollars or anything like","ep103"
"54060",975,"that I know we have that Juliet balcony","ep103"
"54061",978,"but it would have been awesome if we","ep103"
"54062",981,"could have some sort of usable outdoor","ep103"
"54063",984,"space I'm not entirely sure about Pilsen","ep103"
"54064",987,"it's not the South Loop it's not the","ep103"
"54065",990,"area that I really wanted to be in and","ep103"
"54066",993,"it wasn't the style I was looking for it","ep103"
"54067",996,"wasn't a modern irise it didn't have","ep103"
"54068",999,"focus and glass and because of that you","ep103"
"54069",1002,"know I'm unsure ELISA knows what Chris","ep103"
"54070",1005,"is looking for but isn't sure he can","ep103"
"54071",1008,"handle the truth about what it will cost","ep103"
"54072",1011,"this is getting expensive pretty fast I","ep103"
"54073",1014,"know","ep103"
"54074",1017,"[Music]","ep103"

"54079",1032,"with in their $400,000 budget but they","ep103"
"54080",1035,"don't see eye to eye it is quite a","ep103"
"54081",1038,"challenge when you have a couple with","ep103"
"54082",1041,"two very different styles you really","ep103"
"54083",1044,"have to work hard to find something","ep103"
"54084",1047,"that's going to work for both of them so","ep103"
"54085",1050,"far they've seen a contemporary condo","ep103"
"54086",1053,"that was at the top of their budget but","ep103"
"54087",1056,"had the features Chris wanted then they","ep103"
"54088",1059,"saw a well-priced timber loft for Molly","ep103"
"54089",1062,"but it wasn't close enough to downtown","ep103"
"54090",1065,"and he didn't like the style so now","ep103"
"54091",1068,"they're on the north side of the city to","ep103"
"54092",1071,"see another option so this place looks","ep103"
"54093",1074,"like it was designed by Mies van der","ep103"
"54094",1077,"Rohe you are correct it is an iconic","ep103"
"54095",1080,"mid-century modern building about the","ep103"
"54096",1083,"1955 well that's exciting that's exactly","ep103"

"54098",1089,"back two bath condo the list price is","ep103"
"54099",1092,"three hundred and ninety nine thousand","ep103"

"54101",1098,"two hundred and ten dollars a month","ep103"
"54102",1101,"saved a wrench parking you do this is","ep103"
"54103",1104,"getting expensive pretty fast","ep103"
"54104",1107,"I understand but you're both close to","ep103"
"54105",1110,"work okay the views are fantastic from","ep103"
"54106",1113,"the unit what floor are we going 28","ep103"
"54107",1116,"almost all the way to the top oh wow","ep103"
"54108",1119,"look at this he was amazing","ep103"
"54109",1122,"I know these buildings don't generally","ep103"
"54110",1125,"have a balcony space but for a view like","ep103"
"54111",1128,"this I don't mind we really can't get","ep103"
"54112",1131,"any more Chicago than this mm-hm I'm","ep103"

"54116",1143,"floor-to-ceiling windows that's that's","ep103"
"54117",1146,"right yeah well finally so Molly","ep103"
"54118",1149,"is your white kitchen yes it's white but","ep103"
"54119",1152,"it's on the dated side I was yeah is","ep103"
"54120",1155,"that a DVD player it is this seems more","ep103"
"54121",1158,"mid-90s modern the mid-century modern","ep103"
"54122",1161,"down the hall they check out the guest","ep103"
"54123",1164,"bedroom I mean it's small but our guest","ep103"
"54124",1167,"would have a fantastic view as well I'm","ep103"
"54125",1170,"glad I do not see carpet in here no","ep103"
"54126",1173,"carpet anywhere is there like an office","ep103"
"54127",1176,"or den space here there is no den space","ep103"
"54128",1179,"this is just a 2-bed 2bath but i do feel","ep103"
"54129",1182,"like this room is big enough where you","ep103"
"54130",1185,"could have an office space as well","ep103"
"54131",1188,"you know i think i'd be very tight","ep103"
"54132",1191,"ideally it'd be one or the other and","ep103"
"54133",1194,"especially with this weird you know","ep103"
"54134",1197,"heating unit we lose the ability to put","ep103"
"54135",1200,"something against the window","ep103"
"54136",1203,"unfortunately why don't we go take a","ep103"

"54138",1209,"this is just the guest bathroom yes okay","ep103"
"54139",1212,"I like the design of it I just think","ep103"
"54140",1215,"it's a little on the small side the door","ep103"
"54141",1218,"bumps into the shower door be kind of","ep103"
"54142",1221,"awkward as a shower it's hard to see","ep103"

"54144",1227,"bedroom it's right here to your left","ep103"

"54165",1290,"you said the size was great I disagree I","ep103"

"54170",1305,"building does have a laundry room I have","ep103"
"54171",1308,"not done that it's hard to think that","ep103"
"54172",1311,"I'm like paying all this money I thought","ep103"
"54173",1314,"the top of our price point and I'm still","ep103"

"54175",1320,"hold you the laundry I can do it for you","ep103"
"54176",1323,"I don't know if I really want you to now","ep103"
"54177",1326,"Molly and Chris must decide what matters","ep103"
"54178",1329,"most the parking the location for the","ep103"
"54179",1332,"windows color me shocked","ep103"
"54180",1335,"[Music]","ep103"

"54184",1347,"home after seeing a number of places","ep103"
"54185",1350,"it's time to decide so what do you think","ep103"
"54186",1353,"about the contemporary condo with the","ep103"
"54187",1356,"balcony for three hundred and ninety","ep103"
"54188",1359,"thousand dollars you know I love the","ep103"
"54189",1362,"location it's really close to where we","ep103"
"54190",1365,"live now","ep103"
"54191",1368,"the master bathroom was amazing it was","ep103"
"54192",1371,"fully upgraded it was like a spa in","ep103"
"54193",1374,"there the thing that I hated about that","ep103"
"54194",1377,"place is that there was carpet in both","ep103"
"54195",1380,"bedrooms and the kitchen layout seems so","ep103"
"54196",1383,"annoying yeah","ep103"
"54197",1386,"I love the windows in that place nice","ep103"
"54198",1389,"floor-to-ceiling it was the only place","ep103"
"54199",1392,"we looked at with a real balcony but it","ep103"
"54200",1395,"is next to a construction site and lord","ep103"
"54201",1398,"knows what that view is gonna be in a","ep103"
"54202",1401,"couple of years so what about the timber","ep103"
"54203",1404,"loft and pilsen for three hundred and","ep103"
"54204",1407,"sixty thousand dollars I loved it oh my","ep103"
"54205",1410,"gosh it had the exposed brick the","ep103"
"54206",1413,"exposed ductwork no carpet it was huge","ep103"
"54207",1416,"but it did not have outdoor space and it","ep103"
"54208",1419,"certainly didn't have your white kitchen","ep103"
"54209",1422,"you know you're right but it did have","ep103"
"54210",1425,"that enclosed den office space that I","ep103"
"54211",1428,"really wanted it was the only place we","ep103"
"54212",1431,"looked at with it","ep103"
"54213",1434,"it'd be a longer commute to work what","ep103"
"54214",1437,"we're dealing with now we're going to go","ep103"
"54215",1440,"outside more again so be mid-century","ep103"
"54216",1443,"modern high-rise for 399,000","ep103"
"54217",1446,"I don't even need to ask what you","ep103"
"54218",1449,"thought of that one I know you loved it","ep103"
"54219",1452,"yeah I thought I had million-dollar","ep103"
"54220",1455,"views and did have your white kitchen it","ep103"
"54221",1458,"did but it needs a lot of upgrades and","ep103"
"54222",1461,"those bathrooms they were both so tiny","ep103"
"54223",1464,"there's no in unit washer and dryer well","ep103"

"54227",1476,"timber loft color me shocked it's the","ep103"
"54228",1479,"style that I've always wanted it really","ep103"
"54229",1482,"has a warm homey feel to me I can't","ep103"
"54230",1485,"believe I'm saying this but I think that","ep103"
"54231",1488,"one will work best for the two of us are","ep103"
"54232",1491,"you serious I am I'm going to be missing","ep103"
"54233",1494,"the views in the floor-to-ceiling","ep103"
"54234",1497,"windows but the combination of the price","ep103"
"54235",1500,"and the size it was enough to make me","ep103"
"54236",1503,"think this gonna work the best for the","ep103"
"54237",1506,"both of us that's amazing I'm so excited","ep103"
"54238",1509,"should we call ELISA better do it fast","ep103"

"54241",1518,"time to bring out the pig bring out the","ep103"
"54242",1521,"pig we moved in about two weeks ago and","ep103"
"54243",1524,"still unloading some boxes seen you in a","ep103"
"54244",1527,"while this home was listed at $360,000","ep103"
"54245",1530,"and we ended up paying three hundred","ep103"
"54246",1533,"sixty two thousand five hundred but that","ep103"
"54247",1536,"did include a credit for closing cost","ep103"
"54248",1539,"if I knew honestly like it was the one I","ep103"
"54249",1542,"had that kind of butterfly feeling Hey","ep103"
"54250",1545,"yeah it looks nice I like it I think","ep103"
"54251",1548,"it's pretty obvious given this is a loft","ep103"
"54252",1551,"that I compromise the most but not only","ep103"
"54253",1554,"did we get more space for less money it","ep103"

"54333",144,"if we look for a house with space for","ep104"
"54334",147,"them to run we won't have to go on walks","ep104"
"54335",150,"all the time they'll be able to run and","ep104"
"54336",153,"wear themselves out of that way so we","ep104"
"54337",156,"won't have to exercise like we're","ep104"
"54338",159,"supposed to right I want as much","ep104"
"54339",162,"properties we can get the large open","ep104"
"54340",165,"area for the dogs he wants multiple","ep104"
"54341",168,"acres what about his house so it's not","ep104"
"54342",171,"quite as much Anchorage as I was hoping","ep104"
"54343",174,"for him you know something to get 10 20","ep104"
"54344",177,"and up acres we definitely still want","ep104"
"54345",180,"another room for the birds or places","ep104"
"54346",183,"they can be currently we have a big","ep104"
"54347",186,"sunroom lots of windows lots of light","ep104"
"54348",189,"so looking for a new place would","ep104"
"54349",192,"definitely be flexible to where they","ep104"
"54350",195,"have a nice place indoors but also it","ep104"
"54351",198,"will when the weather is nice to happen","ep104"
"54352",201,"of course I would really like a","ep104"
"54353",204,"Craftsman style type home so this house","ep104"
"54354",207,"I really like the look of there's","ep104"
"54355",210,"different definition there's different","ep104"
"54356",213,"depths in the house I'm not saying it's","ep104"
"54357",216,"terrible but I would prefer to go more","ep104"
"54358",219,"ranch farmhouse a lot of the farmhouse","ep104"
"54359",222,"to me is simplicity plain and simple I","ep104"
"54360",225,"would like to have the updated kitchen","ep104"
"54361",228,"and appliances definitely want at least","ep104"
"54362",231,"three bedrooms two bathrooms I think it","ep104"
"54363",234,"might be too much of an open floor plan","ep104"
"54364",237,"we talked about wanting to have that","ep104"
"54365",240,"separation for the dogs and this ever","ep104"
"54366",243,"habit with the large open floor plan","ep104"
"54367",246,"it's very difficult to kind of section","ep104"
"54368",249,"off the house when you're trying to","ep104"
"54369",252,"contain the dog so having a little bit","ep104"
"54370",255,"more defined rooms is gonna make that","ep104"
"54371",258,"process a little bit easier hardwood","ep104"
"54372",261,"floors in there they look really nice","ep104"
"54373",264,"yeah I like that there's no carpet that","ep104"
"54374",267,"means we could do a lot of cleaning and","ep104"
"54375",270,"keeping the birds by the windows as well","ep104"
"54376",273,"I like a big porch on any house","ep104"
"54377",276,"especially the farmhouse style I think","ep104"
"54378",279,"you know the wraparound or a partial","ep104"
"54379",282,"wraparound is a really neat feature whoa","ep104"
"54380",285,"there you go those are just my size curb","ep104"
"54381",288,"appeal is important to both of them and","ep104"
"54382",291,"they both like to avoid a major","ep104"
"54383",294,"renovation having just completed","ep104"
"54384",297,"renovating their current house it's kind","ep104"
"54385",300,"of miserable having to constantly live","ep104"
"54386",303,"through those renovations and yes the","ep104"
"54387",306,"end product was awesome but the road to","ep104"
"54388",309,"get there who is not awesome","ep104"
"54389",312,"still Jordan does like getting his hands","ep104"
"54390",315,"dirty making things one of the bigger","ep104"
"54391",318,"things I'd like to have is a dedicated","ep104"
"54392",321,"workshop I'm pretty sure that's for oil","ep104"
"54393",324,"filters they know they'll be taking on a","ep104"
"54394",327,"long commute by moving out to the","ep104"
"54395",330,"country especially for Jordan whose job","ep104"
"54396",333,"is farther they just hope to keep it at","ep104"
"54397",336,"an hour max our budget is 275 but","ep104"
"54398",339,"realistically we don't really want to go","ep104"
"54399",342,"that high at all going further away from","ep104"
"54400",345,"the city I think we'll get a lot more","ep104"
"54401",348,"bang for our buck first up is a house in","ep104"
"54402",351,"the rural community of Mount Olive","ep104"
"54403",354,"almost 50 miles from st. Louis it's","ep104"
"54404",357,"beautiful out here","ep104"
"54405",360,"that's for sure but this what's my","ep104"
"54406",363,"commute to be right around like 4550","ep104"

"54412",381,"only weight this is a hospital I like hi","ep104"
"54413",384,"Jen hey great what do you think about","ep104"
"54414",387,"the property walking up it's gorgeous","ep104"
"54415",390,"but this isn't really either of our","ep104"
"54416",393,"Styles not far grass a little bit more","ep104"
"54417",396,"of a mid-century type field I know and I","ep104"
"54418",399,"I brought you here because I think that","ep104"
"54419",402,"you're gonna like what the property","ep104"
"54420",405,"has to offer you have a workshop and","ep104"
"54421",408,"you've got acreage and lots of privacy","ep104"
"54422",411,"mmm that's pretty good","ep104"
"54423",414,"it's priced at two hundred thirty two","ep104"
"54424",417,"thousand dollars it's not just a","ep104"
"54425",420,"intriguing all right and I think you'll","ep104"
"54426",423,"see you're gonna need a little extra","ep104"
"54427",426,"room for some updates no gen remodels","ep104"
"54428",429,"but that's alright the property's gonna","ep104"
"54429",432,"be worth it","ep104"
"54430",435,"let's go inside alright you think what","ep104"
"54431",438,"do you think about the front porch","ep104"
"54432",441,"various writing this is great very cute","ep104"
"54433",444,"I like it","ep104"
"54434",447,"[Music]","ep104"
"54435",450,"alright so it's pretty dated in here Don","ep104"
"54436",453,"I know you wanted an updated kitchen but","ep104"
"54437",456,"I want you to keep an open mind as we","ep104"
"54438",459,"take a look at this kitchen","ep104"
"54439",462,"oh yes very open-minded this is a","ep104"
"54440",465,"vintage dishwasher but it's offset by","ep104"
"54441",468,"your stainless steel refrigerators nice","ep104"
"54442",471,"it's bright looks fairly new yeah what","ep104"
"54443",474,"do you think about that ceiling I didn't","ep104"
"54444",477,"even notice that until you just pointed","ep104"
"54445",480,"it out thanks a lot papered ceiling","ep104"
"54446",483,"makes it a little more cozy for the","ep104"
"54447",486,"living space while it's dated I am","ep104"
"54448",489,"thinking that it is a nice setup for the","ep104"
"54449",492,"animals we have this gate that I can eat","ep104"
"54450",495,"you or the animals this is the family","ep104"
"54451",498,"room and look at this this is a nice","ep104"
"54452",501,"view I like being able look out see the","ep104"
"54453",504,"birds and everything so again is that","ep104"
"54454",507,"all of our property at all back there","ep104"
"54455",510,"that's part of the property to off the","ep104"
"54456",513,"dining room is the screened-in porch","ep104"
"54457",516,"this is great I don't see too many","ep104"
"54458",519,"neighbors hanging around here I think","ep104"
"54459",522,"this'll be perfect setup for the birds","ep104"
"54460",525,"and it extends out to another deck so","ep104"
"54461",528,"you have more space for entertaining or","ep104"
"54462",531,"just sitting outside and enjoying the","ep104"
"54463",534,"view they head downstairs to see the","ep104"
"54464",537,"finished basement this would typically","ep104"
"54465",540,"be a family room but I think for you","ep104"
"54466",543,"guys it would be a great place to put","ep104"
"54467",546,"the birds okay it's a possibility I mean","ep104"
"54468",549,"I don't know we could they burns down","ep104"
"54469",552,"here or upstairs what kind of just have","ep104"
"54470",555,"to see they look in on the two","ep104"
"54471",558,"downstairs bedrooms before heading","ep104"
"54472",561,"outside so this is why I brought you to","ep104"
"54473",564,"this house it's beautiful it really is","ep104"
"54474",567,"the nice thing about this piece of","ep104"
"54475",570,"property","ep104"
"54476",573,"seems like it's a pretty good mixture of","ep104"
"54477",576,"timber meadow and lon so at least","ep104"
"54478",579,"there's not a whole bunch of Mon to do","ep104"
"54479",582,"the dogs can run freely over there oh","ep104"
"54480",585,"yeah they run wild I think this house","ep104"
"54481",588,"would be very functional for our animals","ep104"
"54482",591,"the size of property that it comes with","ep104"
"54483",594,"with the 12 acres and the different land","ep104"
"54484",597,"styles that are on the acreage I think","ep104"
"54485",600,"it's great for our animals this is the","ep104"
"54486",603,"first time I've helped someone house","ep104"
"54487",606,"hunt so they have more space for more","ep104"
"54488",609,"animals here is the half bath right yeah","ep104"
"54489",612,"I definitely wanted the full bath but","ep104"
"54490",615,"it's fine it'll get the job done maybe","ep104"
"54491",618,"there's a chance to renovate do some","ep104"
"54492",621,"projects let's go check out the master","ep104"
"54493",624,"bedroom this is a really good-size room","ep104"
"54494",627,"that's a very good-sized room this is a","ep104"
"54495",630,"little bit of kind of an awkward","ep104"
"54496",633,"cubby area I'm sure we can make our","ep104"
"54497",636,"furniture fit if we end up going this","ep104"
"54498",639,"way but I just have to get a little","ep104"
"54499",642,"creative with it let's check out the","ep104"
"54500",645,"master back this is a great size it is","ep104"
"54501",648,"but it's missing one thing no second","ep104"
"54502",651,"sink I don't care about two sinks yeah","ep104"
"54503",654,"well that's because you always used my","ep104"
"54504",657,"sink before I never had a thing well","ep104"
"54505",660,"you've seen the whole house you've seen","ep104"
"54506",663,"the property what are your thoughts","ep104"
"54507",666,"obviously outside is perfectly inside","ep104"
"54508",669,"it's very pet friendly for our situation","ep104"
"54509",672,"with all the animals pet friendly and","ep104"
"54510",675,"lots of land but it's also definitely","ep104"
"54511",678,"dated in your commute I almost forgot","ep104"
"54512",681,"about the commute I definitely wouldn't","ep104"
"54513",684,"forgive that every more to it I'm","ep104"
"54514",687,"driving an hour and a half yeah since","ep104"
"54515",690,"this location makes Jordans commute","ep104"
"54516",693,"almost too far Jen shows the couple a","ep104"
"54517",696,"house much closer to st. Louis both sigh","ep104"
"54518",699,"Jen found us a ranch-style this time","ep104"
"54519",702,"yeah it's definitely not a craftsman","ep104"

"54521",708,"Jordan and John have 275 thousand","ep104"
"54522",711,"dollars for a property with a lot of","ep104"
"54523",714,"land for their pets in rural Illinois","ep104"
"54524",717,"they've seen a mid-century modern on 12","ep104"
"54525",720,"acres their ideal amount of space it had","ep104"
"54526",723,"a workshop and a closed floor plan but","ep104"
"54527",726,"it would need lots of work and at 90","ep104"
"54528",729,"minutes from Jordans job it may just be","ep104"
"54529",732,"too far out so now they're seeing a","ep104"
"54530",735,"place in Belleville that's more Jordan","ep104"
"54531",738,"style and with a shorter commute Oh si","ep104"
"54532",741,"Jin found us a ranch-style this time","ep104"
"54533",744,"yeah it's definitely not a craftsman","ep104"
"54534",747,"they're really open as soon as we got","ep104"
"54535",750,"some property to so that'll be good for","ep104"
"54536",753,"the dogs yeah absolutely got a ranch for","ep104"
"54537",756,"you","ep104"
"54538",759,"excellent only about a 30 to 45-minute","ep104"
"54539",762,"commute it for you Jordan all right","ep104"
"54540",765,"that's good yeah I think you're gonna","ep104"
"54541",768,"like the price what do we got 230,000","ep104"
"54542",771,"opening that's gonna be a problem with","ep104"
"54543",774,"the dogs there's no easy way to section","ep104"
"54544",777,"off different spaces so that they can't","ep104"
"54545",780,"just run them up everywhere the floors","ep104"
"54546",783,"look really nice yeah great space for","ep104"
"54547",786,"the birds with all the windows oh yeah","ep104"
"54548",789,"absolutely being able to have options","ep104"
"54549",792,"really to put the birds just about","ep104"
"54550",795,"anywhere we choose tons of light in here","ep104"
"54551",798,"let's head this way take a look at the","ep104"
"54552",801,"kitchen it's not the kitchen the","ep104"
"54553",804,"refrigerators a little bit different","ep104"
"54554",807,"than the rest appliances so I update","ep104"
"54555",810,"that yes I also notice there's no","ep104"
"54556",813,"Hardware on Taniya anything that's off","ep104"
"54557",816,"of that I would recommend that when we","ep104"
"54558",819,"write an offer on the property we","ep104"
"54559",822,"actually write that in that the seller","ep104"
"54560",825,"is to provide you with an allowance for","ep104"
"54561",828,"hardware and have that installed they go","ep104"
"54562",831,"outside to check out the yard so how","ep104"
"54563",834,"much of this is ours this is a three","ep104"
"54564",837,"acre lot I know that that's not quite as","ep104"
"54565",840,"much as what you're wanting but again","ep104"
"54566",843,"this is what's gonna get you a little","ep104"
"54567",846,"bit closer into town you're missing a","ep104"
"54568",849,"little privacy but we can fix that with","ep104"
"54569",852,"trees good space for the dogs the art is","ep104"
"54570",855,"very open which is great for the dogs","ep104"
"54571",858,"run around but it would also mean we","ep104"
"54572",861,"would have to put an offense to contain","ep104"
"54573",864,"them","ep104"
"54574",867,"[Music]","ep104"
"54575",870,"you know I do live having hard floors","ep104"
"54576",873,"for the dogs but the carpet seems to be","ep104"
"54577",876,"a good color that'll hide dirt so I","ep104"
"54578",879,"think it'll work a bathroom is down the","ep104"
"54579",882,"hall I mean it's a guest bath so I think","ep104"
"54580",885,"it's fine","ep104"
"54581",888,"dan looks nice updated yeah and here is","ep104"
"54582",891,"the master oh not very big is it yeah","ep104"

"54589",912,"don't like the fillers I don't like the","ep104"
"54590",915,"tub I don't like the tile I don't","ep104"
"54591",918,"there's not a thing I like about the","ep104"
"54592",921,"master bath","ep104"
"54593",924,"I want to immediately take those pillars","ep104"
"54594",927,"down they head down to see the lower","ep104"

"54596",933,"your favorite part of the house you know","ep104"
"54597",936,"I don't like the thought of remodeling","ep104"
"54598",939,"and renovating but it's kind of nice to","ep104"
"54599",942,"have a clean blank slate to do whatever","ep104"
"54600",945,"you want with the big huge open basement","ep104"
"54601",948,"is great I think we can maybe put a","ep104"
"54602",951,"living space down there and I could have","ep104"
"54603",954,"a work area you could do a lock down","ep104"
"54604",957,"here this is huge","ep104"
"54605",960,"we've seen everything inside and out","ep104"
"54606",963,"what are your thoughts well it's not the","ep104"
"54607",966,"Craftsman style that I wanted it is the","ep104"
"54608",969,"range thought that I was looking for but","ep104"
"54609",972,"there's a lot of things in here that I'm","ep104"
"54610",975,"not really that thrilled about mainly","ep104"
"54611",978,"the master bath mm-hmm I know it's not","ep104"
"54612",981,"as much property as you wanted I did","ep104"
"54613",984,"like the hot floors throughout it's nice","ep104"
"54614",987,"to be able to move the bird cages around","ep104"
"54615",990,"when we need to the kitchen is updated","ep104"
"54616",993,"well enough I think we can deal with","ep104"
"54617",996,"that","ep104"
"54618",999,"I like that it's open it's very bright","ep104"

"54656",1113,"it's pretty actually it's a very unique","ep104"

"54658",1119,"is your dining area and your kitchen","ep104"
"54659",1122,"this is an upgrade yeah they've","ep104"
"54660",1125,"definitely done some updating in the","ep104"
"54661",1128,"kitchen which is nice because I know","ep104"
"54662",1131,"that's something that's important for","ep104"
"54663",1134,"you yeah","ep104"
"54664",1137,"I mean in all the appliance match which","ep104"
"54665",1140,"is also a plus like they don't have to","ep104"
"54666",1143,"be stainless steel but matching is","ep104"
"54667",1146,"really nice so let me show you the bonus","ep104"
"54668",1149,"round okay so this is a bonus room slash","ep104"
"54669",1152,"laundry room would this be a good place","ep104"
"54670",1155,"for a workshop I think so it could also","ep104"
"54671",1158,"be a good place for the birds the birds","ep104"
"54672",1161,"could you know live in there and enjoy","ep104"
"54673",1164,"themselves however I could do the same","ep104"
"54674",1167,"thing in my own space and they could","ep104"
"54675",1170,"enjoy themselves in the living room down","ep104"
"54676",1173,"the hall is a full bathroom it's a nice","ep104"
"54677",1176,"size but it is a little awkward having a","ep104"
"54678",1179,"bathroom right off the kitchen I feel","ep104"
"54679",1182,"like this could make some some odd","ep104"
"54680",1185,"Thanksgiving dinner moment","ep104"
"54681",1188,"so head on into your master bedroom","ep104"
"54682",1191,"this is actually a burm house what that","ep104"
"54683",1194,"means is that the back side of the house","ep104"
"54684",1197,"is built in to the berm the berm is a","ep104"
"54685",1200,"hill and so the house is built into the","ep104"
"54686",1203,"hillside semi underground if you will so","ep104"
"54687",1206,"you don't have windows on the backside","ep104"
"54688",1209,"but having that door with a nice big","ep104"
"54689",1212,"window gives a lot of good light haven't","ep104"
"54690",1215,"the house built into the hill is unique","ep104"
"54691",1218,"but given our dog situation I'm fairly","ep104"
"54692",1221,"certain the dogs would be up on the roof","ep104"
"54693",1224,"and that could really cause some","ep104"
"54694",1227,"problems down the road let's go check","ep104"
"54695",1230,"out the master bath which what do you","ep104"
"54696",1233,"notice about that it's not attached","ep104"
"54697",1236,"right you notice there's no shower which","ep104"
"54698",1239,"would mean that you have company over","ep104"
"54699",1242,"and you if you need to shower you guys","ep104"
"54700",1245,"go through the kitchen that's weird","ep104"
"54701",1248,"yes this is your second bedroom they","ep104"
"54702",1251,"were smart adding that in because","ep104"
"54703",1254,"without that you couldn't put a window","ep104"
"54704",1257,"there because it is a burm home mm-hmm","ep104"
"54705",1260,"let's take a look upstairs at the third","ep104"
"54706",1263,"bedroom this is really pretty look at","ep104"
"54707",1266,"this view then nice little area for me","ep104"
"54708",1269,"with that pond it's too bad though","ep104"
"54709",1272,"there's no bathroom like right up here","ep104"
"54710",1275,"because this could almost be like a","ep104"
"54711",1278,"master suite very nice and easy access","ep104"
"54712",1281,"to a bathroom they head outside to the","ep104"
"54713",1284,"six acre yard this yard is beautiful the","ep104"
"54714",1287,"dogs would love it they wanted two legs","ep104"
"54715",1290,"they'd be swimming all day however have","ep104"
"54716",1293,"a little concern this is a lot of grass","ep104"
"54717",1296,"to mow","ep104"
"54718",1299,"what about the house what do you think","ep104"
"54719",1302,"about the house","ep104"
"54720",1305,"well the privacy is great it's got the","ep104"
"54721",1308,"nice updated kitchen that I wanted so I","ep104"
"54722",1311,"really like that it's got a little bit","ep104"
"54723",1314,"more of an open floor plan than I wanted","ep104"
"54724",1317,"because it's gonna be hard to section","ep104"
"54725",1320,"off the dogs in certain places you do","ep104"
"54726",1323,"have the room off the kitchen that would","ep104"
"54727",1326,"be great for the birds yeah that's true","ep104"
"54728",1329,"unless we put them in the living room","ep104"
"54729",1332,"and I could have my little workshop up","ep104"
"54730",1335,"there no that's more renovation that's","ep104"
"54731",1338,"what we don't want what I don't want","ep104"
"54732",1341,"that's so much easier than building a","ep104"
"54733",1344,"whole shop for me though well remember","ep104"
"54734",1347,"at this price you do have some room to","ep104"
"54735",1350,"do some renovations don't want to do the","ep104"
"54736",1353,"renovations Jen they've seen several","ep104"
"54737",1356,"options well their choice come down to","ep104"
"54738",1359,"the house in the woods with the long","ep104"
"54739",1362,"commute the ranch with the shorter","ep104"
"54740",1365,"commute but not enough land or the berm","ep104"
"54741",1368,"house with the open floor plan once you","ep104"
"54742",1371,"put that thing down and figure out what","ep104"
"54743",1374,"we're gonna do with this house situation","ep104"
"54744",1377,"okay","ep104"
"54745",1380,"dawn and Jordan have up to two hundred","ep104"
"54746",1383,"and seventy five thousand dollars to","ep104"
"54747",1386,"spend on a new home in Western Illinois","ep104"
"54748",1389,"they've seen several different houses","ep104"
"54749",1392,"but now it's time to decide on one so","ep104"
"54750",1395,"let's start with the house I had the","ep104"
"54751",1398,"woods with it for two hundred thirty two","ep104"
"54752",1401,"thousand man that house was beautiful","ep104"
"54753",1404,"when you pulled up to it inside it was","ep104"
"54754",1407,"closed off and after where you could","ep104"
"54755",1410,"section the dogs off if you need to set","ep104"
"54756",1413,"up four dogs that house was perfect the","ep104"
"54757",1416,"only real drawback I saw to it was all","ep104"
"54758",1419,"of that wallpaper and there's definitely","ep104"
"54759",1422,"some renovations that I see in the","ep104"
"54760",1425,"future I am very concerned like","ep104"
"54761",1428,"everything I think the workshop","ep104"
"54762",1431,"situation at the house with the woods","ep104"
"54763",1434,"was actually really really ideal you","ep104"
"54764",1437,"also have a long commute to work from","ep104"
"54765",1440,"there an hour and a half I think Jen","ep104"
"54766",1443,"said but I loved the property it was so","ep104"
"54767",1446,"private and so serene but what about the","ep104"
"54768",1449,"next house it's the ranch for two","ep104"
"54769",1452,"hundred and thirty thousand that one had","ep104"
"54770",1455,"a very serene beautiful setting had a","ep104"
"54771",1458,"little bit of acreage not as much as we","ep104"
"54772",1461,"still as we wanted the backyard wasn't","ep104"
"54773",1464,"real private you know we'd have to put","ep104"
"54774",1467,"up a fence and everything the kitchen is","ep104"
"54775",1470,"fairly updated the basements blank slate","ep104"
"54776",1473,"to do whatever we want the basement was","ep104"
"54777",1476,"awesome everything was really open on","ep104"
"54778",1479,"the inside of the house I'm not entirely","ep104"
"54779",1482,"sure how we would even try to close that","ep104"
"54780",1485,"off the ranch did have the best floor","ep104"
"54781",1488,"plan though for the birds one thing","ep104"
"54782",1491,"about the ranch is it was actually a","ep104"
"54783",1494,"pretty decent commute what about the","ep104"
"54784",1497,"berm house for 250,000 plenty of room","ep104"
"54785",1500,"for the dogs to run but we would still","ep104"
"54786",1503,"have to build in a fenced-in area there","ep104"
"54787",1506,"because there was nothing to contain","ep104"
"54788",1509,"them they'd always be going into these","ep104"
"54789",1512,"ponds and lakes whatever out there what","ep104"
"54790",1515,"about the burn being built into the hill","ep104"
"54791",1518,"what do you think of that even though","ep104"
"54792",1521,"the back half was stuck in the side of a","ep104"
"54793",1524,"hill the front half was so bright it","ep104"
"54794",1527,"didn't feel like you were subterranean","ep104"
"54795",1530,"at all inside that master bath that","ep104"
"54796",1533,"wasn't connected on to the master","ep104"
"54797",1536,"bedroom meeting some updating there's a","ep104"
"54798",1539,"lot of things I think we would need to","ep104"
"54799",1542,"do to that house but it was quite a ways","ep104"
"54800",1545,"under budget to where we could you know","ep104"
"54801",1548,"maybe accomplish those things they had","ep104"
"54802",1551,"that one little bonus room but I know","ep104"
"54803",1554,"you wanted to put the birds there still","ep104"
"54804",1557,"a long commute from there I think my","ep104"
"54805",1560,"commute was for an hour somewhere around","ep104"
"54806",1563,"there so which one will they choose","ep104"
"54807",1566,"[Music]","ep104"
"54808",1569,"so house that's in the woods has a great","ep104"
"54809",1572,"setup for the dogs I think the house is","ep104"
"54810",1575,"a little more conducive thar needs yeah","ep104"
"54811",1578,"plus it's got all the acreage yeah long","ep104"
"54812",1581,"commute from there but I love the","ep104"
"54813",1584,"property did we just make our decision I","ep104"
"54814",1587,"think that was it all right we made our","ep104"
"54815",1590,"decision here","ep104"
"54816",1593,"let's finish tighten this up real quick","ep104"
"54817",1596,"the asking price of this house is two","ep104"
"54818",1599,"hundred thirty two thousand dollars we","ep104"
"54819",1602,"were able to negotiate a few things few","ep104"
"54820",1605,"items with the house into that price and","ep104"
"54821",1608,"ended up paying that I ended up winning","ep104"
"54822",1611,"this house because of all the outdoor","ep104"
"54823",1614,"features that eight gives us and I got a","ep104"
"54824",1617,"workshop so I mean it was it was really","ep104"
"54825",1620,"a win-win on all fronts","ep104"
"54826",1623,"we have Zen we'll kinda have to work","ep104"
"54827",1626,"with them so he doesn't just like barrel","ep104"
"54828",1629,"through this dogs have adjusted the best","ep104"
"54829",1632,"of this place it's so nice that they can","ep104"
"54830",1635,"just go outside and run around and the","ep104"
"54831",1638,"twelve acres and we don't have to worry","ep104"
"54832",1641,"about them right now the birds are a","ep104"
"54833",1644,"little separated and just help them","ep104"
"54834",1647,"adjust a little easily so one doesn't","ep104"
"54835",1650,"bully the other one and to help them","ep104"
"54836",1653,"really settle in for a while we keep","ep104"
"54837",1656,"even the dogs away from the birds right","ep104"
"54838",1659,"now just so they can become adjusted we","ep104"
"54839",1662,"know there's going to be projects but at","ep104"

"55289",1332,"to his work the mountain village house","ep105"
"55290",1335,"was a little over budget but I just","ep105"

"55292",1341,"picturing it was close to your job it","ep105"

"55294",1347,"village that was so close that's what we","ep105"
"55295",1350,"came for it just feels like that Italian","ep105"
"55296",1353,"living I was looking for but let's be","ep105"
"55297",1356,"realistic there's no cell coverage in","ep105"
"55298",1359,"that town this is a little bit isolated","ep105"
"55299",1362,"the house in town was the most over","ep105"
"55300",1365,"budget yeah but I'd be close to work","ep105"
"55301",1368,"I'm gonna be ready my bike interesting","ep105"

"55303",1374,"Italian charm that I was hoping","ep105"
"55304",1377,"important the two family home it was the","ep105"
"55305",1380,"only house that was on budget 850 mm oh","ep105"
"55306",1383,"wow perfect a little tiny and I like","ep105"
"55307",1386,"some of the little characters with some","ep105"
"55308",1389,"modern touches no I want that yard is it","ep105"
"55309",1392,"perfect but we're gonna be sharing the","ep105"
"55310",1395,"yard is about 30 minutes away from the","ep105"
"55311",1398,"base okay but it's too far from work","ep105"
"55312",1401,"[Music]","ep105"
"55313",1404,"I think we're gonna have to drop the one","ep105"
"55314",1407,"with the long commute the two family","ep105"
"55315",1410,"home mm-hmm I mean sharing a house that","ep105"
"55316",1413,"would be kind of challenging especially","ep105"
"55317",1416,"with the kids I think those would have a","ep105"
"55318",1419,"lot of drawbacks so the house in town I","ep105"
"55319",1422,"think the location to work is going to","ep105"
"55320",1425,"be perfect that was the most over-budget","ep105"
"55321",1428,"a hundred bucks a month yeah but I'd be","ep105"
"55322",1431,"able to ride my bike or walk to work so","ep105"
"55323",1434,"we'd be saving money that way it also","ep105"
"55324",1437,"has that garden that you really wanted","ep105"
"55325",1440,"that was awesome","ep105"
"55326",1443,"but it also kind of had him a lot more","ep105"
"55327",1446,"Americans around I feel like it lost","ep105"
"55328",1449,"some of that Italian praise much and I","ep105"
"55329",1452,"really was hoping for well remember they","ep105"
"55330",1455,"have the market there once a week so I","ep105"
"55331",1458,"think you could practice your Italian","ep105"

"55333",1464,"the mountain village home it's got","ep105"
"55334",1467,"basically everything I feel like I'm a","ep105"
"55335",1470,"wish list it was close enough to work","ep105"
"55336",1473,"still have the fenced-in garden but","ep105"
"55337",1476,"church bells it was just girl Mantic and","ep105"
"55338",1479,"the mountains with their views was love","ep105"
"55339",1482,"the yard and garden were a little bit","ep105"
"55340",1485,"smaller than we wanted and also there's","ep105"
"55341",1488,"no cell service and I need to be on call","ep105"
"55342",1491,"for work so it was just so hard I know","ep105"
"55343",1494,"but I think we need to be realistic","ep105"
"55344",1497,"about this I don't like being realistic","ep105"
"55345",1500,"I guess if we are and we probably should","ep105"
"55346",1503,"choose the house in town it meets most","ep105"
"55347",1506,"of our criteria and you bicycling to","ep105"
"55348",1509,"work would be really nice it's gonna be","ep105"

"55707",1002,"door that might have to check there's","ep106"

"55712",1017,"the Salt Lake City area but have","ep106"
"55713",1020,"different priorities for their first","ep106"
"55714",1023,"home working with a $400,000 budget","ep106"
"55715",1026,"they've seen a traditional new build for","ep106"
"55716",1029,"her but it didn't have the backyard he","ep106"
"55717",1032,"wants then they saw a country cottage on","ep106"
"55718",1035,"a half acre of land with plenty of","ep106"
"55719",1038,"projects for Chase but it wasn't move-in","ep106"
"55720",1041,"ready enough for her so now they're ten","ep106"
"55721",1044,"minutes from family in Clearfield to see","ep106"
"55722",1047,"a contemporary house what's the price","ep106"
"55723",1050,"range three thirty nine nine so it's","ep106"
"55724",1053,"well below what we've been looking for","ep106"
"55725",1056,"gives you room to make changes if","ep106"
"55726",1059,"there's things that you don't like or","ep106"
"55727",1062,"things that Chase wants like the","ep106"
"55728",1065,"three-car Garage let's chase you're","ep106"
"55729",1068,"gonna love the three-car Garage aren't","ep106"
"55730",1071,"ya and the blue door that might have to","ep106"
"55731",1074,"change there's where the paint comes in","ep106"
"55732",1077,"overall I think this house definitely","ep106"
"55733",1080,"provides that three-car garage that I","ep106"
"55734",1083,"was looking for but one thing that I","ep106"
"55735",1086,"really want is kind of that wraparound","ep106"
"55736",1089,"porch which is something this house","ep106"
"55737",1092,"doesn't offer to come on in oh my gosh","ep106"
"55738",1095,"look at all this hardwood floor Wow it","ep106"
"55739",1098,"was beautiful I love that there's no","ep106"
"55740",1101,"carpet in this dining room and the","ep106"
"55741",1104,"shutters are nice too what do you think","ep106"
"55742",1107,"of the paint yeah that's something","ep106"
"55743",1110,"that's gonna need to be fixed it's a","ep106"
"55744",1113,"cheap fix and I'm always okay with that","ep106"
"55745",1116,"well I love this grand room I love that","ep106"
"55746",1119,"it's just one great room be better","ep106"
"55747",1122,"though if the recessed lighting carried","ep106"
"55748",1125,"out through about the entire house so","ep106"
"55749",1128,"maybe that's something we could do in","ep106"
"55750",1131,"the future I do love these wide-open","ep106"
"55751",1134,"windows gives great light just they","ep106"
"55752",1137,"don't see a fireplace yeah it was one of","ep106"
"55753",1140,"those things I could not get well that","ep106"
"55754",1143,"just might have to be something we","ep106"
"55755",1146,"compromise on they step outside to see","ep106"
"55756",1149,"the yard oh I love it nice that it's","ep106"
"55757",1152,"fully fenced it would be perfect for a","ep106"
"55758",1155,"dog take a look at this why you don't","ep106"
"55759",1158,"have a fireplace inside you do have a","ep106"
"55760",1161,"fire pit outside so you can still gather","ep106"
"55761",1164,"around and enjoy that yeah perfect for","ep106"
"55762",1167,"hosting I love their garden too yeah","ep106"
"55763",1170,"this is a bonus","ep106"
"55764",1173,"but one thing I love about this kitchen","ep106"
"55765",1176,"is the open concept the one thing though","ep106"
"55766",1179,"it's lacking is those white cabinets","ep106"
"55767",1182,"they actually kind of like that wood the","ep106"
"55768",1185,"kitchen is an ideal we don't have the","ep106"
"55769",1188,"white cabinets don't have the granite","ep106"
"55770",1191,"countertops the house isn't perfect but","ep106"
"55771",1194,"it is turnkey they're able to move in","ep106"
"55772",1197,"here and make changes as they go it's","ep106"
"55773",1200,"simple things and I think they can","ep106"
"55774",1203,"really personalize the house to their","ep106"
"55775",1206,"needs I love it I love that it's","ep106"
"55776",1209,"unfinished really is the chaise space it","ep106"
"55777",1212,"just it feels like a dungeon down here","ep106"
"55778",1215,"you do have some natural lighting down","ep106"
"55779",1218,"here so it does keep it a little less","ep106"
"55780",1221,"dungeon esque they head to the second","ep106"
"55781",1224,"floor to see the master oh this is small","ep106"
"55782",1227,"yeah not ideal I do like the carpet I'm","ep106"
"55783",1230,"not really a fan of this carpet yeah the","ep106"
"55784",1233,"carpet will have to be torn out what","ep106"
"55785",1236,"about the bathroom this room needs an","ep106"
"55786",1239,"update","ep106"
"55787",1242,"yeah definitely some TLC the vanity is a","ep106"
"55788",1245,"lot older I think one of the biggest","ep106"
"55789",1248,"things honestly though this bathroom is","ep106"
"55790",1251,"missing is the his-and-her sinks the","ep106"
"55791",1254,"master bath is a complete renovation","ep106"
"55792",1257,"project and it's definitely a deal","ep106"
"55793",1260,"breaker for me","ep106"
"55794",1263,"and the master bathroom is really","ep106"
"55795",1266,"outdated so it's gonna require a lot of","ep106"
"55796",1269,"work but I love that it's under budget","ep106"
"55797",1272,"so it would definitely be an ideal","ep106"
"55798",1275,"opportunity to actually appreciate the","ep106"
"55799",1278,"value of the home wow this is just what","ep106"
"55800",1281,"I'm looking for nice and spacious well","ep106"
"55801",1284,"this is just one of three extra bedrooms","ep106"
"55802",1287,"that you have in the house actually like","ep106"
"55803",1290,"it may be an office space it'll","ep106"
"55804",1293,"definitely have the paint it they look","ep106"
"55805",1296,"at two more bedrooms stripes again this","ep106"
"55806",1299,"house is gonna really need a lot of","ep106"
"55807",1302,"paint","ep106"
"55808",1305,"it's definitely modernized but it has","ep106"
"55809",1308,"that traditional feel I like it","ep106"
"55810",1311,"I love the unfinished basement what's","ep106"

"56131",609,"work work I think the biggest challenge","ep107"
"56132",612,"is to be near school and to pay a lower","ep107"
"56133",615,"price but depends on what she wants","ep107"
"56134",618,"it's hard to find a deal where Jenna","ep107"

"56272",1032,"yeah that's true if you share then it","ep107"
"56273",1035,"would be cut in half and it only be 300","ep107"
"56274",1038,"then it'd be the cheapest out of all of","ep107"
"56275",1041,"them mm-hmm that's true","ep107"
"56276",1044,"think about okay so okay welcome really","ep107"

"56297",1107,"would you decide","ep107"
"56298",1110,"I'd prefer this room yeah I still think","ep107"
"56299",1113,"Jenna's more into this place just","ep107"
"56300",1116,"because it is in the city","ep107"
"56301",1119,"I still want Jenna to have fun out here","ep107"
"56302",1122,"and really experience the Spanish","ep107"
"56303",1125,"culture but I also wanted her to focus","ep107"
"56304",1128,"on her job and what she came here for -","ep107"
"56305",1131,"oh yes it's really nice it is bigger","ep107"
"56306",1134,"than what I thought I guess yeah","ep107"
"56307",1137,"probably fit a table out here yes you","ep107"
"56308",1140,"can fit a table here yeah it looks like","ep107"
"56309",1143,"the nightlife would get pretty big too","ep107"
"56310",1146,"here there's a lot of people help right","ep107"
"56311",1149,"now yeah what do you think about the","ep107"
"56312",1152,"flats overall it's nice it's a nice","ep107"
"56313",1155,"space it's big seems a little","ep107"
"56314",1158,"old-fashioned yeah a little outdated","ep107"
"56315",1161,"with the furniture and the colors and","ep107"
"56316",1164,"everything I just don't know if I like","ep107"
"56317",1167,"the idea of having apartment then also","ep107"
"56318",1170,"that commute to work is gonna be pretty","ep107"
"56319",1173,"intense I don't know I just love the","ep107"
"56320",1176,"idea of being in the city just the toll","ep107"
"56321",1179,"of taking 45 minutes every day to go to","ep107"
"56322",1182,"and from work even though it doesn't","ep107"
"56323",1185,"sound like much now and you're a couple","ep107"
"56324",1188,"weeks and it's gonna be tough","ep107"
"56325",1191,"Jenna came to Spain to live life to the","ep107"
"56326",1194,"fullest Steven wants to give her a","ep107"
"56327",1197,"reality check","ep107"
"56328",1200,"I know you wanted to be in the city but","ep107"
"56329",1203,"my personal opinion I think it'd be nice","ep107"
"56330",1206,"to shoot under budget a little bit and","ep107"
"56331",1209,"then also be really close to your work","ep107"
"56332",1212,"as well it's just a little quiet","ep107"
"56333",1215,"Jenna is in Spain to experience","ep107"
"56334",1218,"something different than the suburban","ep107"
"56335",1221,"life she's known yeah I know you were","ep107"
"56336",1224,"lugging really close to the nightlife","ep107"
"56337",1227,"and everything she's eager to check out","ep107"
"56338",1230,"city life but her now long-distance","ep107"
"56339",1233,"boyfriend Stephen thinks she needs to","ep107"
"56340",1236,"focus on what makes the most sense I","ep107"
"56341",1239,"think every day the commute would take a","ep107"
"56342",1242,"toll on her what do you think of the big","ep107"
"56343",1245,"balcony fun house 1 is in Alba 2nd","ep107"
"56344",1248,"that's really I like this a lot","ep107"
"56345",1251,"I know you would love that and then","ep107"
"56346",1254,"being really close to the nightlife and","ep107"
"56347",1257,"everything would be a bus but it also","ep107"
"56348",1260,"was a really long commute to work every","ep107"
"56349",1263,"day yeah so that's nice I can told I","ep107"
"56350",1266,"knew you liked the village I know you","ep107"
"56351",1269,"like melody but she's worried about","ep107"
"56352",1272,"feeling isolated by village life it","ep107"
"56353",1275,"seems a little a little quiet a little","ep107"
"56354",1278,"dead it just seemed like it was a ghost","ep107"
"56355",1281,"town well what did you think about the","ep107"
"56356",1284,"shared flood what's really nice is in","ep107"
"56357",1287,"the city center I can see the nightlife","ep107"
"56358",1290,"all around but in order to make it","ep107"
"56359",1293,"budget-friendly she'd have to get a","ep107"
"56360",1296,"roommate I don't know if I'm a huge fan","ep107"
"56361",1299,"of that then also that commute to work","ep107"
"56362",1302,"is gonna be pretty intense","ep107"
"56363",1305,"[Music]","ep107"
"56364",1308,"do you feel like you could cross any of","ep107"
"56365",1311,"them off your list right now it would","ep107"
"56366",1314,"probably be the shared yeah I agree","ep107"
"56367",1317,"it had all the amenities I was looking","ep107"
"56368",1320,"for but I just don't like the idea of","ep107"
"56369",1323,"having to live with somebody and then","ep107"
"56370",1326,"have to worry about if I leave my knee","ep107"
"56371",1329,"there if it's a problem for them and","ep107"
"56372",1332,"then for when you guys come visit yeah","ep107"
"56373",1335,"it's just a little an inconvenience okay","ep107"
"56374",1338,"so we have two choices yeah so are you","ep107"
"56375",1341,"leaning towards any one in particular","ep107"
"56376",1344,"right now big balcony well I was right","ep107"
"56377",1347,"in the city center and I really loved","ep107"
"56378",1350,"the views from the balcony and the fact","ep107"
"56379",1353,"that I can walk to the city and watch","ep107"
"56380",1356,"games and it had a lot of the amenities","ep107"
"56381",1359,"we were looking for","ep107"
"56382",1362,"I know you wanted to be in this city but","ep107"
"56383",1365,"my personal opinion I think it'd be nice","ep107"
"56384",1368,"to shoot under budget a little bit and","ep107"
"56385",1371,"then also be really close to your work","ep107"
"56386",1374,"as well it'd be perfect","ep107"
"56387",1377,"yeah but then that just means it's 40","ep107"
"56388",1380,"minutes from other side there yeah but","ep107"
"56389",1383,"it's always available and you can always","ep107"
"56390",1386,"catch a ride whenever you need to to get","ep107"
"56391",1389,"to the city yeah that's true and the","ep107"
"56392",1392,"village did seem like it had a lot to","ep107"
"56393",1395,"offer","ep107"
"56394",1398,"I mean surprisingly I didn't think it","ep107"
"56395",1401,"would have so many restaurants and cafes","ep107"
"56396",1404,"yeah I was still a really lively village","ep107"

"56902",1407,"dollar price range and are meeting with","ep108"
"56903",1410,"their broker Heather to decide which is","ep108"

"56910",1431,"go that kitchen is perfect","ep108"
"56911",1434,"don't touch that kitchen the one thing","ep108"
"56912",1437,"it was a little far from the beach","ep108"
"56913",1440,"it's only a mile and a half you could","ep108"

"56915",1446,"golf cart to the beach I know it just","ep108"

"56921",1464,"the fact that it's close to the beach","ep108"
"56922",1467,"I'm not wild about the fixer-upper part","ep108"
"56923",1470,"the biggest thing to me about that house","ep108"
"56924",1473,"is that it's a blank slate you can make","ep108"
"56925",1476,"it into anything but it's in the exactly","ep108"
"56926",1479,"perfect location it definitely is a","ep108"

"56931",1494,"ceilings","ep108"
"56932",1497,"I guess the compromise then really is","ep108"
"56933",1500,"the Florida farmhouse set 1 million","ep108"
"56934",1503,"seven hundred twenty-five thousand that","ep108"
"56935",1506,"house is beautiful I love the kitchen I","ep108"

"56938",1515,"spendin lanai outside yeah in that","ep108"
"56939",1518,"kitchen we'd have to do something with","ep108"

"56941",1524,"cold to me while we could do don't","ep108"
"56942",1527,"change the floors yeah no we wouldn't","ep108"
"56943",1530,"change and don't forget that house it","ep108"
"56944",1533,"wasn't at the high end of the budget","ep108"
"56945",1536,"it's it is out of the budget","ep108"
"56946",1539,"when Ed and I moved here for his job we","ep108"
"56947",1542,"said one thing that we're going to make","ep108"
"56948",1545,"sure that we do is we want to live at","ep108"

"56953",1560,"it gave up a lot to come down here for","ep108"
"56954",1563,"my job I wanted to be able to give her","ep108"
"56955",1566,"what she wanted so the beach house it is","ep108"
"56956",1569,"this needs to come out also yeah take","ep108"
"56957",1572,"this out and then we'll have the vault","ep108"
"56958",1575,"in here when we bought the house it was","ep108"
"56959",1578,"so exciting because it was always a","ep108"
"56960",1581,"dream of mine to have a house at the","ep108"
"56961",1584,"beach so when I turned the key and I","ep108"
"56962",1587,"realized the vision of what I could do","ep108"
"56963",1590,"with the home I just got really excited","ep108"
"56964",1593,"and I got to admit when I turned the kid","ep108"

"56966",1599,"have we done can you take the threshold","ep108"
"56967",1602,"or you know you could I'm really excited","ep108"
"56968",1605,"about working with Heather Kane because","ep108"
"56969",1608,"I can start to see the vision that we","ep108"
"56970",1611,"have for our home and if you remove this","ep108"
"56971",1614,"front with all of the arches right here","ep108"
"56972",1617,"I feel like it will really take away","ep108"
"56973",1620,"some of that Mediterranean look the","ep108"
"56974",1623,"exterior style of the house is not","ep108"
"56975",1626,"exactly what either ELISA or I wanted","ep108"
"56976",1629,"however we've talked with our builder","ep108"
"56977",1632,"and we have some ideas baby put up some","ep108"
"56978",1635,"shutters definitely change some of the","ep108"
"56979",1638,"colors so we can really change the way","ep108"
"56980",1641,"the front of the house looks this wall","ep108"

"57284",891,"one had a master ensuite it's a newer","ep109"
"57285",894,"house it's definitely not the craftsman","ep109"
"57286",897,"yeah porch chance I'm going to try and","ep109"
"57287",900,"keep an open mind but it's going to be","ep109"
"57288",903,"really hard welcome to this newer home","ep109"
"57289",906,"Matt I like it","ep109"
"57290",909,"this was built in 2004 it is more","ep109"
"57291",912,"traditional not a craftsman and it is","ep109"
"57292",915,"listed at two hundred and thirty nine","ep109"
"57293",918,"thousand","ep109"
"57294",921,"then there's probably not a lot that","ep109"
"57295",924,"needs to be right facing to worked on so","ep109"
"57296",927,"it's not gonna add to the price that","ep109"
"57297",930,"much right we're gonna try okay the","ep109"
"57298",933,"dining room is right behind you I don't","ep109"
"57299",936,"know how I feel about the carpet we have","ep109"
"57300",939,"really messy kids there are options you","ep109"
"57301",942,"can put a big rug under the table yeah","ep109"
"57302",945,"that is very true I like these floors I","ep109"
"57303",948,"really like the coloring I do like the","ep109"
"57304",951,"fireplace and you put the tea that there","ep109"
"57305",954,"it's kind of a focal point of the room","ep109"
"57306",957,"ton of a little bit of a craftsman feel","ep109"
"57307",960,"right here a little bit you know what if","ep109"
"57308",963,"you paint the trim right and then you","ep109"
"57309",966,"paint the walls gray like it's a whole","ep109"
"57310",969,"other house liking this house then right","ep109"
"57311",972,"[Laughter]","ep109"
"57312",975,"with it let's see the rest of the house","ep109"
"57313",978,"it's warm enough to you this is a really","ep109"
"57314",981,"small kitchen it almost just this credit","ep109"
"57315",984,"is what we have right now we could live","ep109"
"57316",987,"in this for a while but I definitely","ep109"
"57317",990,"would want to make this the white","ep109"
"57318",993,"kitchen I've always dreamed of I think","ep109"
"57319",996,"the biggest concern is just space to","ep109"
"57320",999,"make more space that would be a huge","ep109"
"57321",1002,"expense","ep109"
"57322",1005,"I think it'll longer and it'll be","ep109"
"57323",1008,"worthwhile because we know we start","ep109"
"57324",1011,"doing renovations on a kitchen we're not","ep109"
"57325",1014,"gonna open up the walls and find things","ep109"
"57326",1017,"behind the walls that we're gonna be","ep109"
"57327",1020,"shocked by since it's a newer home you","ep109"
"57328",1023,"never know so a good long really","ep109"
"57329",1026,"it's nice and green and it's open space","ep109"
"57330",1029,"it's pretty flat we didn't ask you does","ep109"
"57331",1032,"this house have an HOA it does I","ep109"
"57332",1035,"probably can't chickens correct it's not","ep109"
"57333",1038,"a deal-breaker for me does that mean","ep109"
"57334",1041,"there's a pool though in the","ep109"
"57335",1044,"neighborhood","ep109"
"57336",1047,"there is but there's a pool there's","ep109"
"57337",1050,"probably grounds around usually the","ep109"
"57338",1053,"chickens you know it doesn't make it for","ep109"
"57339",1056,"the chickens at all but it does make up","ep109"
"57340",1059,"for the size of the yard they head","ep109"
"57341",1062,"inside and check out the half bath and","ep109"
"57342",1065,"laundry room on the way to the garage oh","ep109"
"57343",1068,"yeah there's plenty of space in there","ep109"
"57344",1071,"you know what smells like a garage","ep109"
"57345",1074,"next they see the master I really like","ep109"
"57346",1077,"these ceilings my eyes kind of drawn up","ep109"
"57347",1080,"to them and it does make the room feel","ep109"
"57348",1083,"larger I think I'm thinking about is","ep109"
"57349",1086,"sleeping during the day and we're right","ep109"
"57350",1089,"outside where most the stuff goes on","ep109"
"57351",1092,"during the day but I like what I see","ep109"
"57352",1095,"right here it's huge and you each have","ep109"
"57353",1098,"your own sink the closet is right there","ep109"
"57354",1101,"I love that there's so many built-ins in","ep109"
"57355",1104,"here worth the extra nine thousand","ep109"
"57356",1107,"another room over here they go upstairs","ep109"
"57357",1110,"and see two bedrooms and a second full","ep109"
"57358",1113,"bath I really like that there's a","ep109"
"57359",1116,"doorway it's really important for kids","ep109"
"57360",1119,"in foster care to know that they have","ep109"
"57361",1122,"yeah before seeing the last bedroom hey","ep109"
"57362",1125,"that's cool I love this okay","ep109"
"57363",1128,"cool play yeah for the girl that's","ep109"
"57364",1131,"exactly right","ep109"
"57365",1134,"yeah cuz I can imagine them playing up","ep109"
"57366",1137,"here during the day while I'm downstairs","ep109"
"57367",1140,"sleeping and that would keep the noise","ep109"
"57368",1143,"levels down in the main level home it's","ep109"
"57369",1146,"just a nice feature you know it's like","ep109"
"57370",1149,"you could find this in an older home I","ep109"
"57371",1152,"like it of course because it's a newer","ep109"
"57372",1155,"build and it has a really great yard","ep109"
"57373",1158,"outside the sleeping is you know on the","ep109"
"57374",1161,"same level as all the action where the","ep109"
"57375",1164,"kitchen the living room is I think that","ep109"
"57376",1167,"we can easily remedy that with the extra","ep109"
"57377",1170,"play room we have upstairs well","ep109"
"57378",1173,"obviously it was not quite my style but","ep109"
"57379",1176,"I love the master bathroom I mean that","ep109"
"57380",1179,"really got my heart throb and I really","ep109"
"57381",1182,"liked that I even 90 feet can at the","ep109"
"57382",1185,"open floor plan the kitchens kind of","ep109"
"57383",1188,"small I probably won't get any chickens","ep109"
"57384",1191,"which I'm really bummed about I need my","ep109"
"57385",1194,"chickens just think about your bathtub","ep109"
"57386",1197,"it's decision time and it might all come","ep109"
"57387",1200,"down to the lure of a modern master","ep109"
"57388",1203,"ensuite versus historic charm I'm a","ep109"
"57389",1206,"little sick to my stomach right now","ep109"
"57390",1209,"[Applause]","ep109"
"57391",1212,"geez we want a slide with a budget of","ep109"
"57392",1215,"230,000 dollars","ep109"
"57393",1218,"Kendra and Matt have been searching for","ep109"
"57394",1221,"a home in Liberty Missouri that's big","ep109"
"57395",1224,"enough to make room in their young","ep109"
"57396",1227,"family for adopted foster children","ep109"
"57397",1230,"they've seen several possible places but","ep109"
"57398",1233,"now it's time to make a decision let's","ep109"
"57399",1236,"start with the the green craftsman that","ep109"
"57400",1239,"was the only one that was under budget","ep109"
"57401",1242,"that yard was awesome was quite one of","ep109"
"57402",1245,"the best features of that house actually","ep109"
"57403",1248,"I could definitely have chickens in that","ep109"
"57404",1251,"year and your chickens two stories I","ep109"
"57405",1254,"could sleep during the day obviously I","ep109"
"57406",1257,"love the Craftsman style the big thing","ep109"
"57407",1260,"is there's no garage and there is no","ep109"
"57408",1263,"master bathroom in fact we would be","ep109"
"57409",1266,"sharing a bathroom with all of the kids","ep109"
"57410",1269,"but about the Victorians it's an older","ep109"
"57411",1272,"home it's already over budget but when","ep109"
"57412",1275,"you walked into that home I mean just","ep109"
"57413",1278,"the front door it just told the story","ep109"
"57414",1281,"those pocket doors were awesome yeah and","ep109"
"57415",1284,"they seemed to be a really good shape to","ep109"
"57416",1287,"it and it had a three-car garage so","ep109"
"57417",1290,"fourth bedroom which we really need is","ep109"
"57418",1293,"on the very very top level on that that","ep109"
"57419",1296,"kitchen is really out of data it did not","ep109"
"57420",1299,"have that master ensuite what about that","ep109"
"57421",1302,"newer building we're not gonna have to","ep109"
"57422",1305,"put a ton of work in it to be moving","ep109"
"57423",1308,"ready you say that but that kitchen we","ep109"
"57424",1311,"aren't really gonna have the money to","ep109"
"57425",1314,"spend because it's at the top of our","ep109"
"57426",1317,"price range it does have two and a half","ep109"
"57427",1320,"bathrooms actually it was the only house","ep109"
"57428",1323,"we saw that had a master bathroom like","ep109"
"57429",1326,"we really wanted that yard was awesome I","ep109"
"57430",1329,"can't believe that you loved that yard I","ep109"
"57431",1332,"mean it's like a quarter of the size of","ep109"
"57432",1335,"the yard a Victorian home so which one","ep109"
"57433",1338,"will they choose","ep109"
"57434",1341,"[Music]","ep109"
"57435",1344,"when I walked into the craftsman I could","ep109"
"57436",1347,"picture it all you know really did feel","ep109"
"57437",1350,"like home I think I had that gut feeling","ep109"
"57438",1353,"too as if it was made for you know","ep109"
"57439",1356,"family just like us to live in it so is","ep109"
"57440",1359,"that it","ep109"
"57441",1362,"I think without regret I would choose","ep109"
"57442",1365,"this house with you yeah we can","ep109"
"57443",1368,"eventually put shower and the main level","ep109"
"57444",1371,"bathroom later on down the line because","ep109"
"57445",1374,"it's only 180 thousand that's all","ep109"
"57446",1377,"they're asking for it ready talked again","ep109"
"57447",1380,"yeah","ep109"
"57448",1383,"then this kitchen is great hon it's","ep109"
"57449",1386,"great we closed three weeks ago and we","ep109"
"57450",1389,"moved in about a week and a half ago","ep109"
"57451",1392,"your turn they were asking 180,000 and","ep109"
"57452",1395,"we offered full price than it makes an","ep109"
"57453",1398,"offer within hours which was a relief","ep109"
"57454",1401,"because I don't think we could have","ep109"
"57455",1404,"handled it I love this porch man this is","ep109"
"57456",1407,"great","ep109"
"57457",1410,"I need to I got my historic home Matt I","ep109"
"57458",1413,"think had to compromise them most out of","ep109"
"57459",1416,"the two of us he is going to have a lot","ep109"
"57460",1419,"of work to do on this home over the","ep109"
"57461",1422,"years just to keep it up the thing that","ep109"
"57462",1425,"really want me over about this house is","ep109"
"57463",1428,"it was cool to just sit back and just","ep109"
"57464",1431,"watch the kids play in the backyard","ep109"
"57465",1434,"which is really what's worth it to me","ep109"
"57466",1437,"it's all yours","ep109"
"57467",1440,"and they love their room at our old","ep109"
"57468",1443,"house you didn't have any room for your","ep109"
"57469",1446,"tent in your room it's just two of them","ep109"
"57470",1449,"and you can tell that they actually","ep109"
"57471",1452,"really like that I have great plans for","ep109"
"57472",1455,"our bathroom on the main level","ep109"
"57473",1458,"don't use that you'll gouge the wall in","ep109"
"57474",1461,"the next probably six months we'll","ep109"
"57475",1464,"probably end up putting a bathtub in","ep109"
"57476",1467,"that bathroom it sounds a little bit","ep109"
"57477",1470,"crazy but we were willing to sacrifice a","ep109"
"57478",1473,"master bathroom for character ask us","ep109"
"57479",1476,"this question again six months who knows","ep109"
"57480",1479,"how will feel we have picked out our","ep109"

"57488",1503,"where guests visitors other people","ep109"
"57489",1506,"foster children can come and find peace","ep109"
"57490",1509,"and joy and","ep109"

"57519",87,"him out after the season was over","ep110"
"57520",90,"because I just couldn't stop thinking","ep110"
"57521",93,"about him and then we quickly became","ep110"
"57522",96,"engaged and I said I don't want to get","ep110"
"57523",99,"an engagement ring because I want to use","ep110"

"57534",132,"International School which I'm extremely","ep110"
"57535",135,"excited about and the additional","ep110"
"57536",138,"excitement is having both of my","ep110"
"57537",141,"daughters there while Jane has taken","ep110"
"57538",144,"care of all of the home logistics I'm","ep110"
"57539",147,"gonna be trying to make sure I know the","ep110"
"57540",150,"curriculum well getting to know the new","ep110"
"57541",153,"schedule our girls have lived in one","ep110"
"57542",156,"place for their entire lives and we're","ep110"
"57543",159,"putting them in a completely new","ep110"
"57544",162,"environment so it's important for us","ep110"
"57545",165,"that they have a place where they still","ep110"
"57546",168,"feel like that foundation and that home","ep110"
"57547",171,"is their Surrey is a beautiful rural","ep110"
"57548",174,"County as within 30 to 40 minutes","ep110"
"57549",177,"commute of central London there are lots","ep110"
"57550",180,"of kind of sixteenth and","ep110"
"57551",183,"seventeenth-century properties and that","ep110"
"57552",186,"gives the area really lovely kind of","ep110"
"57553",189,"rich historical feel we're looking at a","ep110"
"57554",192,"minimum of three bedrooms we have two","ep110"
"57555",195,"girls they are not going to be sharing a","ep110"
"57556",198,"room so we really need to at least have","ep110"
"57557",201,"a three bedroom now that said you","ep110"
"57558",204,"definitely need a dedicated workspace","ep110"
"57559",207,"because I'm gonna be spending a lot of","ep110"
"57560",210,"time writing I've been a sports writer","ep110"
"57561",213,"for the last 20 years so what I really","ep110"
"57562",216,"want to look forward to is maybe","ep110"
"57563",219,"research for an upcoming book tell me","ep110"
"57564",222,"about the sort of area that you're","ep110"
"57565",225,"interested in Steve's gonna be teaching","ep110"
"57566",228,"at a school in Surrey and the kids will","ep110"
"57567",231,"be going there as well","ep110"
"57568",234,"so we want to be close to the school it","ep110"
"57569",237,"would be great to be able to walk I","ep110"
"57570",240,"don't want to be on a bus a train but if","ep110"
"57571",243,"we found the perfect place and it was a","ep110"
"57572",246,"short bus ride away I'm gonna think we'd","ep110"
"57573",249,"have to consider that now what about a","ep110"
"57574",252,"periods charm versus modern where do you","ep110"
"57575",255,"stand on","ep110"
"57576",258,"I think I lean more towards modern I","ep110"

"57614",372,"half baths and also the water bit","ep110"
"57615",375,"concerned from the moment that you step","ep110"

"57628",414,"wood-burning stove yeah here's a little","ep110"
"57629",417,"look for you to write your great","ep110"
"57630",420,"American novel it's a little bit closed","ep110"
"57631",423,"in but I think it would probably work","ep110"

"57633",429,"really beat it yeah","ep110"
"57634",432,"is a spectacular setting it feels like","ep110"

"57646",468,"with clothes that are drying directly","ep110"
"57647",471,"over your head I don't know how I feel","ep110"
"57648",474,"about stirring the soup and looking up","ep110"
"57649",477,"and there are my underpants isn't that","ep110"
"57650",480,"English charm","ep110"
"57651",483,"[Laughter]","ep110"
"57652",486,"now come through to this bedroom I think","ep110"
"57653",489,"this would be one of the kids bedrooms","ep110"
"57654",492,"it's certainly spacious enough I'm not","ep110"
"57655",495,"crazy about carpet I mean look it's","ep110"

"57661",513,"here's the family bathroom guys have a","ep110"
"57662",516,"look very basic what do you think I'm","ep110"
"57663",519,"not a huge fan of this green but it does","ep110"
"57664",522,"have all the requirements I think you","ep110"
"57665",525,"could definitely use a facelift look","ep110"
"57666",528,"this is the master bedroom it's got this","ep110"
"57667",531,"is boudoir here that's very cute I love","ep110"

"57671",543,"see there Oh Steve it's a closet slash","ep110"

"57674",552,"location I love the setup with the","ep110"
"57675",555,"living room and even most of the kitchen","ep110"
"57676",558,"yeah I think there was really lots of","ep110"
"57677",561,"love particularly this setting it would","ep110"
"57678",564,"be completely unique for Jeanne and","ep110"
"57679",567,"Charlotte to have an experience growing","ep110"
"57680",570,"up here I think that would be fantastic","ep110"
"57681",573,"that said after drying the clothes once","ep110"
"57682",576,"or twice I might get tired of that and","ep110"
"57683",579,"the bathroom situation I think in the","ep110"
"57684",582,"morning would be really difficult I'm a","ep110"
"57685",585,"bit worried about Jane perhaps being a","ep110"
"57686",588,"bit more conservative than I'd like I","ep110"
"57687",591,"think she's one of these people that","ep110"
"57688",594,"likes to see the big picture and then","ep110"
"57689",597,"she'll want to sit back and make a","ep110"
"57690",600,"decision a traditional four bedroom","ep110"
"57691",603,"townhouse gets them back on dry land you","ep110"

"57702",636,"to the English countryside from the","ep110"

"57870",1140,"minutes walk from Steve's school that I","ep110"
"57871",1143,"think will be suitable for him and Jane","ep110"

"57917",1281,"out here or there's another space down","ep110"
"57918",1284,"there follow me the problem is that","ep110"
"57919",1287,"having the garden doesn't offset the","ep110"
"57920",1290,"cost of new furniture is it a compromise","ep110"

"57946",1368,"amazing but it's not furnished having to","ep110"
"57947",1371,"buy furniture for our place is really a","ep110"
"57948",1374,"concern all of that adds up to money and","ep110"
"57949",1377,"time the biggest concern for me is that","ep110"
"57950",1380,"it's a 40-minute commute to work each","ep110"
"57951",1383,"day it's just a matter of whether or not","ep110"
"57952",1386,"having an adequate amount of space and a","ep110"
"57953",1389,"really charming neighborhood offsets the","ep110"
"57954",1392,"commute that you'd have to do every day","ep110"
"57955",1395,"a little bit damp here well we are in","ep110"

"57974",1452,"the views in that River House it was","ep110"
"57975",1455,"such a unique setting and I think I","ep110"
"57976",1458,"could be pretty creative there it's a","ep110"
"57977",1461,"great work space kind of isolated but at","ep110"
"57978",1464,"the same time in the middle of","ep110"

"57982",1476,"why what were your thoughts about it","ep110"
"57983",1479,"it's like an engineering course for the","ep110"
"57984",1482,"kids and how you use pulleys and levers","ep110"
"57985",1485,"the more traditional town house has four","ep110"
"57986",1488,"bedrooms and a workroom for Jane there","ep110"
"57987",1491,"was a lot of space in that house that","ep110"
"57988",1494,"was pretty useful but if downstairs was","ep110"
"57989",1497,"really big with that bay window all of","ep110"
"57990",1500,"this light floods through into the","ep110"
"57991",1503,"dining area and through to the kitchen","ep110"
"57992",1506,"and then if you looked at the kitchen","ep110"
"57993",1509,"also a lot of space I like the deck out","ep110"
"57994",1512,"back I wasn't really a much of a garden","ep110"
"57995",1515,"but you could entertain a bit out there","ep110"
"57996",1518,"the biggest concern for me is that it's","ep110"
"57997",1521,"a 40-minute commute to work each day but","ep110"
"57998",1524,"it's under budget and it's furnished now","ep110"
"57999",1527,"what about the garden house the garden","ep110"
"58000",1530,"house has a lot to like but we have to","ep110"
"58001",1533,"start off with a huge negative it's not","ep110"
"58002",1536,"furnished and it's at the top of our","ep110"
"58003",1539,"budget","ep110"
"58004",1542,"the gardens do it for me it's a two","ep110"
"58005",1545,"Gardens this is lovely this is a little","ep110"
"58006",1548,"bit of Surrey in your own backyard and","ep110"
"58007",1551,"definitely a very English type of style","ep110"
"58008",1554,"and I think just coming home under that","ep110"
"58009",1557,"little archway would kind of make it","ep110"
"58010",1560,"seem charming you mentioned my favorite","ep110"
"58011",1563,"part of that house the coming home part","ep110"
"58012",1566,"that is a 10-minute walk from school","ep110"
"58013",1569,"[Music]","ep110"
"58014",1572,"I think we know which one is the least","ep110"
"58015",1575,"practical option for our family what do","ep110"
"58016",1578,"you think I think we probably agree","ep110"
"58017",1581,"what's yours River House is ridiculous","ep110"
"58018",1584,"I am NOT gonna be cranking my way across","ep110"
"58019",1587,"a river to get to my home day and night","ep110"
"58020",1590,"that's true","ep110"
"58021",1593,"all right the river house is out so it's","ep110"
"58022",1596,"between the town house and the garden","ep110"
"58023",1599,"house I think we have a lot to think","ep110"
"58024",1602,"about with those two because each of","ep110"
"58025",1605,"them kind of have different things we","ep110"
"58026",1608,"really like about them","ep110"
"58027",1611,"the town has some great qualities","ep110"
"58028",1614,"including an extra bedroom which we","ep110"
"58029",1617,"could use for friends or relatives and","ep110"
"58030",1620,"you could easily convert into an office","ep110"
"58031",1623,"the kitchen was huge and then the","ep110"
"58032",1626,"accordion doors that opened up into the","ep110"
"58033",1629,"patio it gives us a lot of extra space","ep110"
"58034",1632,"and on a nice day it gives us an extra","ep110"
"58035",1635,"room it is under budget however it is a","ep110"
"58036",1638,"very long commute to school okay the","ep110"
"58037",1641,"garden house had a lot of positive","ep110"
"58038",1644,"qualities also you just don't love the","ep110"
"58039",1647,"idea of furnishing it the garden house","ep110"
"58040",1650,"is $3,200 which is at the very top of","ep110"
"58041",1653,"our budget while the townhouse is $3,000","ep110"
"58042",1656,"a month which means that we would have a","ep110"
"58043",1659,"little bit of extra money to play with","ep110"
"58044",1662,"let's talk about the garden house for a","ep110"
"58045",1665,"second okay I really liked the fact that","ep110"
"58046",1668,"it had two beautiful gardens yeah and we","ep110"
"58047",1671,"didn't see that really in any other","ep110"
"58048",1674,"place right and it has two human-sized","ep110"
"58049",1677,"bathrooms for me though you know it's","ep110"

"58054",1692,"you to do any writing let me just make","ep110"
"58055",1695,"the case for the townhouse it really has","ep110"
"58056",1698,"all the space inside that we need for me","ep110"
"58057",1701,"it provides an office it's so far away","ep110"

"58059",1707,"gonna be me and Gina and Charlotte doing","ep110"
"58060",1710,"that community twice a day so I really","ep110"

"58292",594,"to add a fence so the price point is","ep111"

"58361",801,"heading through a small pantry they take","ep111"
"58362",804,"a look at the kitchen","ep111"
"58363",807,"so it's a nice that dated kitchen hmm I","ep111"
"58364",810,"love the white countertops and the dark","ep111"

"58370",828,"island in here either","ep111"
"58371",831,"yeah and it's a little bit far away from","ep111"

"58387",879,"great office space for you there's a","ep111"
"58388",882,"room across the hall that would be great","ep111"

"58409",945,"personality the price is great and I","ep111"
"58410",948,"could give us plenty of playing room to","ep111"
"58411",951,"do whatever we want without but the","ep111"
"58412",954,"kitchen was too far away from the family","ep111"

"58414",960,"much closed off for my liking well so","ep111"
"58415",963,"I'm actually really surprised there's","ep111"

"58507",1239,"not willing to rip up carpet I don't","ep111"
"58508",1242,"want to deal with that let's look at the","ep111"
"58509",1245,"master bathroom hmm it's gonna have to","ep111"
"58510",1248,"be redone as it's very outdated it ain't","ep111"
"58511",1251,"very 1990s look here's another full","ep111"

"58516",1266,"additional bedrooms on the second floor","ep111"
"58517",1269,"it's a great space I can totally see","ep111"
"58518",1272,"this being Dominic's room","ep111"
"58519",1275,"so I love that it's a colonial it's","ep111"
"58520",1278,"exactly what I'm looking for in that","ep111"
"58521",1281,"aspect I love having the fenced-in","ep111"
"58522",1284,"backyard all the bedrooms are upstairs","ep111"
"58523",1287,"which was a huge thing for me but at the","ep111"
"58524",1290,"same time I also do hate the","ep111"
"58525",1293,"wall-to-wall carpeting","ep111"
"58526",1296,"my kitchen was so dark so I really don't","ep111"

"58531",1311,"to the kitchen and the entertaining the","ep111"
"58532",1314,"purposes dislikes I wanted something","ep111"
"58533",1317,"more of a Victorian with funky rooms","ep111"
"58534",1320,"because it did kind of look a little bit","ep111"
"58535",1323,"cookie cutter but the great room kind of","ep111"
"58536",1326,"saved that from being not as unique none","ep111"
"58537",1329,"of the homes hit all the marks so","ep111"
"58538",1332,"Stephanie and Steven have to weigh","ep111"
"58539",1335,"what's most important an open kitchen","ep111"
"58540",1338,"hardwood throughout or a fenced-in","ep111"
"58541",1341,"backyard I know at home I want I know at","ep111"
"58542",1344,"home I want","ep111"
"58543",1347,"Steven and Stephanie are looking to move","ep111"
"58544",1350,"out of a cramped Boston condo and into a","ep111"
"58545",1353,"spacious new hallway with a budget of","ep111"
"58546",1356,"1.1 million dollars it's time to decide","ep111"
"58547",1359,"priced at 1.15 million the first option","ep111"
"58548",1362,"is a new home in Lynn field","ep111"
"58549",1365,"I loved that new construction home","ep111"
"58550",1368,"I know it's over budget but like way","ep111"
"58551",1371,"over budget it's a gorgeous entryway","ep111"
"58552",1374,"hardwood floors all throughout the","ep111"
"58553",1377,"kitchen was amazing and the backyard was","ep111"
"58554",1380,"big but we would also have to put a","ep111"
"58555",1383,"fence around the yard and I wasn't","ep111"
"58556",1386,"comfortable with which room would be my","ep111"
"58557",1389,"office I just thought it was great I","ep111"
"58558",1392,"definitely think it's worth it the turn","ep111"
"58559",1395,"of the century Victorian and Dorchester","ep111"
"58560",1398,"is the least expensive at five hundred","ep111"
"58561",1401,"and fifty thousand dollars well you know","ep111"
"58562",1404,"I love Victorian and I loved all the","ep111"
"58563",1407,"funky rooms and nooks and crannies in","ep111"
"58564",1410,"the house and although the price was","ep111"
"58565",1413,"amazing just thought there was a lot of","ep111"
"58566",1416,"work to do the kitchen is really nicely","ep111"
"58567",1419,"updated and there were no carpets in the","ep111"
"58568",1422,"bedroom but there really was no backyard","ep111"
"58569",1425,"then there's a newer colonial in","ep111"
"58570",1428,"Burlington for eight hundred and ninety","ep111"
"58571",1431,"thousand dollars I did like it for a","ep111"
"58572",1434,"colonial the yard is amazing it is","ep111"
"58573",1437,"cookie cutter shape but it did have a","ep111"

"58580",1458,"bedrooms upstairs I do hate though that","ep111"
"58581",1461,"all the bedrooms have carpeting in it","ep111"
"58582",1464,"[Music]","ep111"
"58583",1467,"which one do you think is the better","ep111"
"58584",1470,"purchase the colonial home in Burlington","ep111"
"58585",1473,"is my choice because I love the great","ep111"
"58586",1476,"room and it's in the middle of our price","ep111"
"58587",1479,"point I actually do agree with you","ep111"
"58588",1482,"because it just had all the space that","ep111"
"58589",1485,"we were looking for I just see a lot","ep111"

"59172",165,"return on investment for us our budget","ep113"

"59174",171,"move-in-ready house that we wouldn't","ep113"
"59175",174,"have to make any major changes on","ep113"
"59176",177,"although they agree on budget they're","ep113"
"59177",180,"polar opposites when it comes to style I","ep113"
"59178",183,"love the statement door that's painted","ep113"
"59179",186,"Orange the geometric lines the Palm","ep113"
"59180",189,"Springs mid-century modern vibe is","ep113"
"59181",192,"perfect I really prefer something more","ep113"
"59182",195,"mid-century modern I prefer a little bit","ep113"
"59183",198,"more straight lines and having that open","ep113"
"59184",201,"floor plan I definitely wouldn't go for","ep113"
"59185",204,"that color but I like the style of that","ep113"
"59186",207,"little cottage home I am really looking","ep113"
"59187",210,"for a bungalow cottage type home I","ep113"
"59188",213,"really like the cozy homey feel ideally","ep113"
"59189",216,"we're looking for a two-bedroom house","ep113"
"59190",219,"with two fairly equally sized bedrooms","ep113"
"59191",222,"and two bathrooms yeah because we cannot","ep113"
"59192",225,"share","ep113"
"59193",228,"this is super cool I love the embroidery","ep113"
"59194",231,"yeah it's really vivid I'm starting a","ep113"
"59195",234,"vintage clothing business and I've been","ep113"
"59196",237,"collecting vintage for the past maybe 10","ep113"
"59197",240,"years ideally I love it have a home","ep113"
"59198",243,"office because I do spend all of my time","ep113"
"59199",246,"working from home I really love board","ep113"
"59200",249,"working and an ideal space would be a","ep113"
"59201",252,"pretty sizable shed with power if it had","ep113"
"59202",255,"AC they also don't agree on how much","ep113"
"59203",258,"renovation they're willing to take on I","ep113"
"59204",261,"would really like to find a project I've","ep113"
"59205",264,"done tile work of refinishing floors","ep113"
"59206",267,"painting wallpapering and I don't really","ep113"
"59207",270,"have any of those skills em got me in","ep113"
"59208",273,"the shop one time and helps you make a","ep113"
"59209",276,"cutting board and that went medium bad","ep113"
"59210",279,"so I mean something that's a little bit","ep113"
"59211",282,"closer to move-in-ready would be a lot","ep113"
"59212",285,"more ideal for me it's pretty crazy to","ep113"
"59213",288,"think that we might actually be","ep113"
"59214",291,"homeowners","ep113"
"59215",294,"I know yeah it's really nuts and Emma","ep113"
"59216",297,"levy would like to stay close to Austin","ep113"
"59217",300,"City Center to keep her commute time","ep113"
"59218",303,"short now that were in our late 20s I","ep113"
"59219",306,"think that it's pretty common in hitting","ep113"
"59220",309,"this age that you start to I don't know","ep113"
"59221",312,"like suddenly you're like jolted into","ep113"
"59222",315,"reality like what are you doing with","ep113"
"59223",318,"your life and so that definitely hit","ep113"
"59224",321,"both of us very hard in the last year or","ep113"
"59225",324,"so and I think that motivated us to get","ep113"
"59226",327,"moving or things yeah we're ready to buy","ep113"
"59227",330,"a house first up is a house in East","ep113"
"59228",333,"Austin that's about seven miles from","ep113"
"59229",336,"downtown and it's closer to Emma Levy's","ep113"
"59230",339,"style so I brought you to this cottage","ep113"
"59231",342,"style house it's a three-bedroom","ep113"
"59232",345,"two-bath it's a little over 1,300 square","ep113"
"59233",348,"feet listed for 225 where are we we're","ep113"
"59234",351,"in East Austin are you sure I assure you","ep113"
"59235",354,"we're still in East Austin okay we'll","ep113"
"59236",357,"take your word okay it's almost","ep113"
"59237",360,"impossible to find something that they","ep113"
"59238",363,"want with all the criteria within the","ep113"
"59239",366,"budget that's very close to the city","ep113"
"59240",369,"it's really cute I like the cottage","ep113"
"59241",372,"style I like the size of it it's","ep113"
"59242",375,"definitely not mid-century modern which","ep113"
"59243",378,"doesn't please me and there's a driveway","ep113"
"59244",381,"that leads to nowhere right now well it","ep113"
"59245",384,"leads to the bedroom boys","ep113"
"59246",387,"[Music]","ep113"
"59247",390,"ladies this has definitely been like","ep113"
"59248",393,"updated but it has with terrible choices","ep113"
"59249",396,"then floorplan is nice that it's open","ep113"
"59250",399,"but and it's open but it doesn't feel","ep113"
"59251",402,"too overwhelming I think that the","ep113"
"59252",405,"floorplan actually marries my cottage","ep113"
"59253",408,"vibe and Emily's want for an open floor","ep113"
"59254",411,"plan really nicely","ep113"
"59255",414,"I thought the drive up better that's the","ep113"
"59256",417,"drive it is a decently sized room it's","ep113"
"59257",420,"really great that they have those","ep113"
"59258",423,"windows like perfectly positioned to","ep113"
"59259",426,"yeah just come straight there a closet","ep113"
"59260",429,"is in the master bath okay this is","ep113"
"59261",432,"strange","ep113"
"59262",435,"yeah let's shower is like framed like a","ep113"
"59263",438,"picture yeah just crawl in and take off","ep113"
"59264",441,"[Laughter]","ep113"
"59265",444,"[Music]","ep113"
"59266",447,"chamber I don't know all right I like","ep113"
"59267",450,"the flow of the living room into the","ep113"
"59268",453,"kitchen I do like the layout of the","ep113"
"59269",456,"kitchen but these finishes yeah I don't","ep113"
"59270",459,"like the backsplash at all right like","ep113"
"59271",462,"articularly over here with the white","ep113"
"59272",465,"outline - yeah quirky I'll put it that's","ep113"
"59273",468,"different for sure I did want something","ep113"
"59274",471,"that is less of a total fixer-upper but","ep113"
"59275",474,"they fix this one up in a way that is","ep113"
"59276",477,"just disturbing to me well it's big yeah","ep113"
"59277",480,"so let's face there's not an existing","ep113"
"59278",483,"workshop or shed but we could probably","ep113"
"59279",486,"really pretty easily put that in okay","ep113"
"59280",489,"they check out the second bedroom but I","ep113"
"59281",492,"definitely wouldn't want this as my","ep113"
"59282",495,"bedroom but maybe more as an office yeah","ep113"
"59283",498,"that could work and the guest bath it's","ep113"
"59284",501,"a good size and I really love this tile","ep113"
"59285",504,"floor let's look at the final bedroom","ep113"
"59286",507,"that's the biggest one of them all this","ep113"
"59287",510,"room has a really nice vibe to it I like","ep113"
"59288",513,"the big window the natural light this is","ep113"
"59289",516,"a good room so we're gonna be fighting","ep113"
"59290",519,"over this yeah","ep113"
"59291",522,"I did like the cottage style of the home","ep113"
"59292",525,"I think the number of bedrooms is really","ep113"
"59293",528,"good the number of bathrooms is what","ep113"
"59294",531,"we're looking for but I think the","ep113"
"59295",534,"location is absolutely horrible yeah I","ep113"
"59296",537,"feel conflicted because it is nice that","ep113"
"59297",540,"there's enough space for me to have an","ep113"
"59298",543,"office but the debate over who's gonna","ep113"
"59299",546,"get which of the two masters and whose","ep113"
"59300",549,"can live in the drive-up room that's","ep113"
"59301",552,"gonna cause problems between us so we","ep113"
"59302",555,"want to remain friends so now to keep","ep113"
"59303",558,"the peace there agent ray finds a home","ep113"
"59304",561,"that's more Emily o style this is still","ep113"
"59305",564,"really far out for me","ep113"
"59306",567,"how about this one oh I like it I'll try","ep113"
"59307",570,"it on","ep113"
"59308",573,"best friends with the same first name","ep113"
"59309",576,"Emily V and Emily oh are pooling their","ep113"
"59310",579,"resources to buy a home together in","ep113"
"59311",582,"Austin Texas I think that looks great","ep113"
"59312",585,"just kind of cool it's nice that it","ep113"
"59313",588,"floats away from the body - so far","ep113"
"59314",591,"they've seen an updated cottage that was","ep113"
"59315",594,"under their 275 thousand dollar budget","ep113"
"59316",597,"it had dual masters and room for an","ep113"
"59317",600,"office but it was a little far from","ep113"
"59318",603,"downtown and was not the style Emily","ep113"
"59319",606,"wants so now their agent is showing them","ep113"
"59320",609,"a house that's about 10 minutes from","ep113"
"59321",612,"downtown and leans more towards Emily Oh","ep113"
"59322",615,"style today I brought you to this","ep113"
"59323",618,"mid-century modern built in 1971 it's","ep113"
"59324",621,"just under 1,400 square feet four","ep113"
"59325",624,"bedrooms two baths and it's listed for","ep113"
"59326",627,"$285,000 well it's above budget it is","ep113"
"59327",630,"above budget but it's completely","ep113"
"59328",633,"rehabbed turnkey ready to go I do like","ep113"
"59329",636,"that it's more mid-century modern","ep113"
"59330",639,"leaning the lines of it are nice and","ep113"
"59331",642,"geometric this is still really far out","ep113"
"59332",645,"for me","ep113"
"59333",648,"so that house is gonna have to be really","ep113"
"59334",651,"incredible inside to convince me to go","ep113"
"59335",654,"over budget and outside of where I want","ep113"
"59336",657,"to be Windsor Hills is a really cool","ep113"
"59337",660,"neighborhood it's up-and-coming I could","ep113"
"59338",663,"see them really setting their roots here","ep113"
"59339",666,"and grow it into the neighborhood come","ep113"
"59340",669,"on in ladies","ep113"
"59341",672,"Wow man this place has definitely been","ep113"
"59342",675,"updated I can easily see how this could","ep113"
"59343",678,"lend itself to mid-century modern I can","ep113"

"59347",690,"I'm looking for I don't even mind the","ep113"
"59348",693,"openness of this cuz it still feels","ep113"
"59349",696,"small enough to feel cohesive I will say","ep113"
"59350",699,"the layout of this kitchen is perfect","ep113"
"59351",702,"it has great space for both of us to be","ep113"
"59352",705,"in here and like everything is new as","ep113"

"59367",750,"you can see it's being used as an office","ep113"
"59368",753,"it's definitely too small to be a full","ep113"
"59369",756,"bedroom but yeah it would work for an","ep113"
"59370",759,"office for me they look at the second","ep113"
"59371",762,"bedroom and guest bath it's very great","ep113"

"59378",783,"them and having two is perfect for me I","ep113"
"59379",786,"don't like the implication that that","ep113"
"59380",789,"makes it your room though so that's a","ep113"
"59381",792,"problem I'm not saying anything this is","ep113"
"59382",795,"a nice-sized bathroom yeah this is great","ep113"
"59383",798,"this tile is just so cute I wish they","ep113"

"59385",804,"like that this lever so low it's perfect","ep113"
"59386",807,"ideally I would get the master bedroom","ep113"
"59387",810,"with the two closets together but then","ep113"
"59388",813,"also having the office I mean Emily does","ep113"
"59389",816,"get that really awesome shed that Ray","ep113"

"59392",825,"I like a lot of the updates that they've","ep113"
"59393",828,"done but there's definitely some","ep113"
"59394",831,"challenges","ep113"
"59395",834,"there's no shed except for that tiny","ep113"
"59396",837,"jail out back we're over budget","ep113"
"59397",840,"style-wise this place is great and this","ep113"
"59398",843,"really fitting in that mid-century","ep113"
"59399",846,"modern vibe that I like space wise I'm","ep113"
"59400",849,"not sure how we would divide up the","ep113"
"59401",852,"space but there's a lot of it yeah so","ep113"
"59402",855,"that's a plus I would really like to see","ep113"
"59403",858,"something that has a little bit more of","ep113"
"59404",861,"a project aspect to it I'd really like","ep113"
"59405",864,"to do some of our own renovations in","ep113"
"59406",867,"this process sorry about that","ep113"
"59407",870,"he'll be fine so their agent lines up a","ep113"
"59408",873,"fixer-upper for Emily V but Emily O has","ep113"
"59409",876,"her doubts but this looks like a mess","ep113"
"59410",879,"it's gonna need some love","ep113"
"59411",882,"[Music]","ep113"
"59412",885,"all right can you step a little bit","ep113"
"59413",888,"towards me so I can get a little bit of","ep113"
"59414",891,"action the colors are popping a lot","ep113"
"59415",894,"that's great best friends Emily V and","ep113"
"59416",897,"Emily O are looking to buy their first","ep113"
"59417",900,"home together as 5050 partners in Austin","ep113"
"59418",903,"Texas but finding something close to","ep113"
"59419",906,"Austin city center within their 275","ep113"
"59420",909,"thousand dollar budget that fits their","ep113"
"59421",912,"vastly different tastes has been a","ep113"
"59422",915,"challenge so far they've seen an updated","ep113"
"59423",918,"cottage that has two equal sized","ep113"
"59424",921,"bedrooms and room for Emily O's home","ep113"
"59425",924,"vintage business but one bedroom has","ep113"
"59426",927,"windows that face the driveway and","ep113"
"59427",930,"there's no backyard shed for Emily V's","ep113"
"59428",933,"woodworking next they saw a turnkey","ep113"
"59429",936,"mid-century modern that appealed to","ep113"
"59430",939,"Emily o style but it only had one master","ep113"
"59431",942,"suite was over budget and was far from","ep113"
"59432",945,"the city center so today their agents","ep113"
"59433",948,"showing them a place that's close to","ep113"
"59434",951,"downtown this is a four-bedroom one-bath","ep113"
"59435",954,"bungalow 1224 square feet and it's","ep113"
"59436",957,"listed for 235 thousand dollars I know","ep113"
"59437",960,"that's under your budget","ep113"
"59438",963,"and you're really close to downtown","ep113"
"59439",966,"today I'm showing the Emily something","ep113"
"59440",969,"that they can afford within the city","ep113"
"59441",972,"limits","ep113"
"59442",975,"it's a good location you know it's a","ep113"
"59443",978,"straight shot to downtown well location","ep113"
"59444",981,"is good but this looks like a mess it's","ep113"
"59445",984,"gonna need some love my first impression","ep113"
"59446",987,"of this house is that it's a huge scary","ep113"
"59447",990,"project and I definitely don't want a","ep113"
"59448",993,"project I think it has a lot of","ep113"
"59449",996,"potential I do know that the seller is","ep113"
"59450",999,"highly motivated they stop mid","ep113"
"59451",1002,"renovation so that could be your game","ep113"
"59452",1005,"it's so small and it definitely doesn't","ep113"
"59453",1008,"have that open field that I like the","ep113"
"59454",1011,"floors aren't really nice they are nice","ep113"
"59455",1014,"but they definitely need work it's not","ep113"
"59456",1017,"gonna be that much work oh it's a good","ep113"
"59457",1020,"size it's a great size I do like these","ep113"
"59458",1023,"tile floors they have a little bit of a","ep113"
"59459",1026,"vintage feel and I think they could lend","ep113"
"59460",1029,"themselves to mid-century modern let's","ep113"
"59461",1032,"check out the bathroom oh this is nasty","ep113"
"59462",1035,"but I think that with just a little bit","ep113"
"59463",1038,"of work we could make this really cute a","ep113"
"59464",1041,"little bit of work yeah we would have to","ep113"
"59465",1044,"take all the tile out put in brand-new","ep113"
"59466",1047,"tile but that shouldn't be too much work","ep113"
"59467",1050,"and we can do that pretty cheaply if we","ep113"
"59468",1053,"do it ourselves maybe but this scares me","ep113"
"59469",1056,"I'm like not comfortable with it","ep113"
"59470",1059,"well definitely if this is the only","ep113"
"59471",1062,"bathroom we can put in it's probably a","ep113"
"59472",1065,"deal-breaker let's check out the","ep113"
"59473",1068,"bedrooms all right it's a decent amount","ep113"
"59474",1071,"of space in here this is the master this","ep113"
"59475",1074,"is the master still have hardwoods here","ep113"
"59476",1077,"that nice open concept do you want they","ep113"
"59477",1080,"look at the second bedroom it's small I","ep113"
"59478",1083,"don't know if either of our stuff would","ep113"
"59479",1086,"fit in here yeah I can't fit my friend","ep113"
"59480",1089,"sure in here and the third bedroom this","ep113"
"59481",1092,"is super creepy and let me sleep me just","ep113"
"59482",1095,"the rubber room in the center of the","ep113"
"59483",1098,"living room they did you can tell here","ep113"
"59484",1101,"there's just all this unfinished work","ep113"
"59485",1104,"here and I bet that wood runs all the","ep113"
"59486",1107,"way into the living room we could take","ep113"
"59487",1110,"these walls out and open this up to the","ep113"
"59488",1113,"main living area you probably could and","ep113"
"59489",1116,"there's possibly some room in here for","ep113"
"59490",1119,"that other bathroom you're looking for I","ep113"
"59491",1122,"think that could really change the feel","ep113"
"59492",1125,"of the house completely","ep113"
"59493",1128,"yeah well the feel right now is creepy","ep113"
"59494",1131,"dungeon so if we can avoid that they see","ep113"
"59495",1134,"the final bedroom this is really small","ep113"
"59496",1137,"okay I have an idea how would I take","ep113"
"59497",1140,"this room and the Blue Room knock down","ep113"
"59498",1143,"the wall and have one big room oh now","ep113"
"59499",1146,"you're knocking down walls","ep113"
"59500",1149,"I may have drained your teams","ep113"
"59501",1152,"[Music]","ep113"
"59502",1155,"they head outside to see an attached","ep113"
"59503",1158,"studio oh wow","ep113"
"59504",1161,"actually I mean I do think this could be","ep113"
"59505",1164,"a cool space for my vintage business","ep113"
"59506",1167,"like it's set up an office in here it is","ep113"
"59507",1170,"really nice that it's totally separate","ep113"
"59508",1173,"from the rest of the house","ep113"
"59509",1176,"yeah even has the little bathroom and","ep113"
"59510",1179,"kitchenette it's very clear that the","ep113"
"59511",1182,"people that were living here just left","ep113"
"59512",1185,"in the middle of the night probably","ep113"
"59513",1188,"didn't even turn off the light there's a","ep113"
"59514",1191,"lot to finish up as you can see they","ep113"
"59515",1194,"started working on the foundation oh","ep113"
"59516",1197,"yeah let me show you this show that's","ep113"
"59517",1200,"back here oh this is really great","ep113"
"59518",1203,"there's already all this built-in","ep113"
"59519",1206,"storage - yeah","ep113"
"59520",1209,"and that lofted area up there would be","ep113"
"59521",1212,"really great for getting stuff out of","ep113"
"59522",1215,"the way","ep113"
"59523",1218,"this is definitely a huge plus I think","ep113"
"59524",1221,"that there's a lot of work to be done","ep113"
"59525",1224,"but there's also a lot of potential to","ep113"
"59526",1227,"make this a space that really suits both","ep113"
"59527",1230,"of us I really love that there's the","ep113"
"59528",1233,"shed out back and I think that there's","ep113"
"59529",1236,"just some good bones that we can work","ep113"
"59530",1239,"with with this house the separate studio","ep113"
"59531",1242,"if you could put in some floor and use","ep113"
"59532",1245,"it as my office that would be amazing I","ep113"
"59533",1248,"wouldn't have to rent an office space","ep113"
"59534",1251,"but I am so really overwhelmed by the","ep113"
"59535",1254,"list of everything that needs to be done","ep113"
"59536",1257,"and I just don't know if we have the","ep113"
"59537",1260,"budget or the skills to take those on","ep113"
"59538",1263,"but I really doubt that we're gonna be","ep113"
"59539",1266,"able to find something in our price","ep113"
"59540",1269,"range this close to the city and that's","ep113"
"59541",1272,"really a lot to think about mm-hmm","ep113"
"59542",1275,"since none of the houses come close to","ep113"
"59543",1278,"satisfying both of the Emily's very","ep113"
"59544",1281,"different tastes their decision could","ep113"
"59545",1284,"come down to bedroom size proximity to","ep113"
"59546",1287,"downtown or a house with few projects","ep113"
"59547",1290,"all right which one are you leaning","ep113"
"59548",1293,"towards","ep113"
"59549",1296,"best friends Emily V and Emily o are","ep113"
"59550",1299,"looking to buy their first house","ep113"
"59551",1302,"together in Austin Texas they've seen a","ep113"
"59552",1305,"number of places close to their two","ep113"
"59553",1308,"hundred and seventy five thousand dollar","ep113"
"59554",1311,"price range and now they have to make a","ep113"
"59555",1314,"decision first is an updated cottage at","ep113"
"59556",1317,"two hundred and twenty-five thousand","ep113"
"59557",1320,"dollars I like that it's been updated","ep113"
"59558",1323,"and has some of the renovations done I","ep113"
"59559",1326,"did like the flow of the kitchen into","ep113"
"59560",1329,"the living space I think that it is kind","ep113"
"59561",1332,"of nice that there are two pretty","ep113"
"59562",1335,"separate wings that kind of flank a","ep113"
"59563",1338,"shared area unfortunately one you're","ep113"
"59564",1341,"gonna get flashed in the face with","ep113"
"59565",1344,"headlights and the location is really","ep113"
"59566",1347,"bad next is a mid-century turnkey at two","ep113"
"59567",1350,"hundred and eighty-five thousand I","ep113"
"59568",1353,"obviously love mid-century modern house","ep113"
"59569",1356,"ticks so many of the boxes for me it has","ep113"
"59570",1359,"that great master it has an office space","ep113"
"59571",1362,"for me I really really like the house","ep113"
"59572",1365,"but major sticking points for me are","ep113"
"59573",1368,"it's already over budget and I was","ep113"
"59574",1371,"hoping to do a lot more of that work","ep113"
"59575",1374,"ourselves last is a bungalow rehab","ep113"
"59576",1377,"that's under budget at two hundred and","ep113"
"59577",1380,"thirty five thousand what did you think","ep113"
"59578",1383,"of that total rehab close to the city I","ep113"
"59579",1386,"am terrified of it but the fact that","ep113"
"59580",1389,"there's an office space that's separate","ep113"
"59581",1392,"from the house is really great but the","ep113"
"59582",1395,"potential of structural issues is very","ep113"
"59583",1398,"scary and overwhelming there's just so","ep113"
"59584",1401,"much potential in that house and I think","ep113"
"59585",1404,"that it really could end up taking a lot","ep113"
"59586",1407,"of boxes for both of us","ep113"
"59587",1410,"[Music]","ep113"
"59588",1413,"which one are you leaning towards all","ep113"
"59589",1416,"right I can't believe I'm saying this","ep113"
"59590",1419,"you're gonna think I'm a complete","ep113"
"59591",1422,"wackadoo but I think the total rehab","ep113"
"59592",1425,"near the city is gonna give us the space","ep113"
"59593",1428,"that we can make our own and exactly","ep113"
"59594",1431,"what we're looking for I'm actually","ep113"
"59595",1434,"really excited about this I think it's","ep113"
"59596",1437,"gonna be a lot of fun you just don't","ep113"
"59597",1440,"know it yet yes our first plant we found","ep113"
"59598",1443,"our home for two months now so the house","ep113"
"59599",1446,"is listed for two hundred and thirty","ep113"
"59600",1449,"five thousand and we ended up getting it","ep113"
"59601",1452,"for two hundred ten thousand which was","ep113"
"59602",1455,"really great that left us a pretty","ep113"
"59603",1458,"sizable budget for all of the rehab that","ep113"
"59604",1461,"we have to do on the house","ep113"
"59605",1464,"neither of us had any idea about","ep113"
"59606",1467,"foundation work things seem to be going","ep113"
"59607",1470,"well until they try to level the studio","ep113"
"59608",1473,"portion of our house and it just decided","ep113"
"59609",1476,"to kind of break off and head for the","ep113"
"59610",1479,"hills we had previously called in a","ep113"
"59611",1482,"structural engineer before you start at","ep113"
"59612",1485,"the foundation and so we're gonna have","ep113"
"59613",1488,"to yeah call him back we got some","ep113"
"59614",1491,"questions I could see something more","ep113"
"59615",1494,"like these kind of tones as some accents","ep113"
"59616",1497,"mm-hmm pops of color currently in the","ep113"
"59617",1500,"house there's really only one master","ep113"
"59618",1503,"bedroom so they're creating a second","ep113"
"59619",1506,"master suite out of the third and fourth","ep113"
"59620",1509,"bedrooms though who gets which room is","ep113"
"59621",1512,"still TBD until they actually move in","ep113"
"59622",1515,"we're definitely planning on taking that","ep113"
"59623",1518,"terrifying middle room down and hoping","ep113"
"59624",1521,"that we can use some of that space to","ep113"
"59625",1524,"create another bathroom it actually","ep113"
"59626",1527,"backs up to the studio apartment","ep113"
"59627",1530,"bathroom so we can just easily connect","ep113"
"59628",1533,"the plumbing under there and I'm saying","ep113"
"59629",1536,"that this is easy but I really have no","ep113"
"59630",1539,"idea so what do you think the subway","ep113"
"59631",1542,"tile yeah looks great","ep113"
"59632",1545,"I definitely compromised on the amount","ep113"
"59633",1548,"of of work that there's only to take on","ep113"
"59634",1551,"but getting a space that we can really","ep113"
"59635",1554,"make perfect for us I'm willing to put","ep113"
"59636",1557,"in a little bit extra time waiting and","ep113"

"60365",432,"a music room so separate from the family","ep115"
"60366",435,"room area and it isn't all open-concept","ep115"

"60369",444,"here's the kitchen this is ninety one is","ep115"

"60372",453,"to match anything else in here the","ep115"
"60373",456,"kitchen is I mean I don't even know how","ep115"
"60374",459,"to put that into words really I mean out","ep115"

"60376",465,"1970s is kind of how I feel now you guys","ep115"
"60377",468,"have to remember this is at the lower","ep115"
"60378",471,"end of your budget there's a lot of room","ep115"
"60379",474,"to make renovations that's true I mean","ep115"
"60380",477,"we could really modernize this and put","ep115"
"60381",480,"our own blueprints on it well you'd have","ep115"
"60382",483,"to because there's really nothing to","ep115"
"60383",486,"salvage out of it down the hall they","ep115"
"60384",489,"take a peek at two bedrooms before","ep115"
"60385",492,"heading into the master Wow I half","ep115"
"60386",495,"expected to see mirrors on the ceiling","ep115"
"60387",498,"this is so underwhelming now you do have","ep115"
"60388",501,"a nice view to your backyard from the","ep115"
"60389",504,"master bedroom that's true okay well I","ep115"
"60390",507,"think we should take a look at the","ep115"
"60391",510,"master bathroom okay great I don't know","ep115"
"60392",513,"which is better than wallpaper or the","ep115"
"60393",516,"tiny tub that I don't think either of us","ep115"
"60394",519,"could","ep115"
"60395",522,"I guess you could remodel it but again","ep115"
"60396",525,"we're remodeling a lot of things already","ep115"
"60397",528,"you're not remodeling at this point","ep115"

"60402",543,"yeah we got a notice full bath and two","ep115"

"60404",549,"down here that is the the five bedrooms","ep115"
"60405",552,"that I was hoping for you could do a","ep115"
"60406",555,"pool table maybe a TV and a nice couch","ep115"
"60407",558,"and family area but you can small it","ep115"
"60408",561,"right away it's got that musty basement","ep115"

"60412",573,"back upstairs Aaron shows them the","ep115"
"60413",576,"garage kind of short on storage space","ep115"
"60414",579,"and not really much of a workbench area","ep115"
"60415",582,"I can see you're a little bit","ep115"
"60416",585,"disappointed but guess what let's go","ep115"
"60417",588,"through that door oh wow this is really","ep115"
"60418",591,"nice area think of all the projects I","ep115"

"60421",600,"shop really are the thing that are","ep115"
"60422",603,"making me rethink this whole property it","ep115"
"60423",606,"makes it one that we really should","ep115"
"60424",609,"consider","ep115"
"60425",612,"well you know I mean as we kind of go","ep115"
"60426",615,"down our wish list it seems to check","ep115"
"60427",618,"everything off it's got the four","ep115"
"60428",621,"bedrooms three bathrooms base for a","ep115"
"60429",624,"music room I always got your shot yeah","ep115"

"60431",630,"acres of land which is double the size","ep115"
"60432",633,"that we were looking at that's","ep115"
"60433",636,"ridiculous","ep115"
"60434",639,"but when we walked in there were a lot","ep115"
"60435",642,"of cosmetic changes that would","ep115"
"60436",645,"definitely need to be updated it","ep115"
"60437",648,"definitely was a renovation heavy house","ep115"
"60438",651,"you know that's something that we really","ep115"
"60439",654,"have to take into account when we're","ep115"
"60440",657,"looking at it so their agent has set up","ep115"
"60441",660,"a house in nearby Brandon that's move-in","ep115"
"60442",663,"ready but now I see there's a side yard","ep115"
"60443",666,"that might be a problem because we can't","ep115"
"60444",669,"really get a fence in here","ep115"
"60445",672,"[Music]","ep115"
"60446",675,"[Applause]","ep115"

"60453",696,"their budget but it had a small master","ep115"
"60454",699,"suite and needed a lot of work so now","ep115"

"60463",726,"there's a side yard that might be a","ep115"
"60464",729,"problem because we can't really get a","ep115"
"60465",732,"fence in here quite a choice for Roz","ep115"
"60466",735,"Leigh and for the dogs that easily","ep115"

"60526",915,"of it as storage but then the rest of it","ep115"
"60527",918,"we could finish off and have as","ep115"
"60528",921,"additional living space I still would","ep115"
"60529",924,"like to just keep it a storage yeah well","ep115"
"60530",927,"that way then we can discuss it later I","ep115"
"60531",930,"guess","ep115"
"60532",933,"[Music]","ep115"
"60533",936,"it hit a lot of our must-haves I mean","ep115"
"60534",939,"it's got a nice big kitchen it's got","ep115"
"60535",942,"that nice cozy feel well it's a great","ep115"
"60536",945,"neighborhood and it's a plus that's","ep115"
"60537",948,"within the brand and Fire District and I","ep115"
"60538",951,"love the way that it's a traditional","ep115"
"60539",954,"farmhouse style but there are a lot of","ep115"
"60540",957,"things that it didn't hit a mark on I","ep115"
"60541",960,"mean it doesn't have four bedrooms right","ep115"
"60542",963,"now it doesn't have three baths yeah and","ep115"
"60543",966,"you didn't seem to like the lawn very","ep115"
"60544",969,"much yeah cuz we'd have to put in a","ep115"
"60545",972,"fence and it might be kind of an odd","ep115"
"60546",975,"yard to put a fence in doesn't have the","ep115"
"60547",978,"garage space that I was really looking","ep115"
"60548",981,"for in a shop area and then you know we","ep115"
"60549",984,"have your unfinished basement what did","ep115"
"60550",987,"you think of that it would add to the","ep115"
"60551",990,"budget to finish the basement so we","ep115"
"60552",993,"definitely have to keep that mind sure","ep115"
"60553",996,"you do want to be conscious of the","ep115"
"60554",999,"budget so keeping their must-haves in","ep115"
"60555",1002,"mind aaron has set up a house that has","ep115"
"60556",1005,"almost everything is there a fire","ep115"
"60557",1008,"department that Casey could belong to no","ep115"
"60558",1011,"there's no volunteer fire department oh","ep115"

"60560",1017,"[Music]","ep115"
"60561",1020,"let's go tickle their noses working with","ep115"
"60562",1023,"a four hundred and fifty thousand dollar","ep115"

"60564",1029,"buy in the Sioux Falls area of South","ep115"

"60570",1047,"kitchen and great master suite but it","ep115"
"60571",1050,"was missing the fourth bedroom they want","ep115"

"60575",1062,"of their styles but he thinks will meet","ep115"
"60576",1065,"most of their wish list so we have a","ep115"

"60603",1146,"really nice backyard yeah look at the","ep115"

"60612",1173,"Lee playing it's so very nice area and I","ep115"
"60613",1176,"do I like the separation between the two","ep115"
"60614",1179,"rooms this house definitely has those","ep115"
"60615",1182,"designated areas you know you're in the","ep115"
"60616",1185,"kitchen you know you're in the living","ep115"
"60617",1188,"room it doesn't wash all together into","ep115"
"60618",1191,"one giant room they head up to the","ep115"
"60619",1194,"second floor and take a look at two","ep115"
"60620",1197,"bedrooms and a full bathroom before","ep115"
"60621",1200,"heading into the master suite oh wow","ep115"
"60622",1203,"this is really spacious a lot of room","ep115"
"60623",1206,"yeah absolutely it's very bright the big","ep115"
"60624",1209,"window letting light in so you got your","ep115"
"60625",1212,"own private bathroom here to non suite","ep115"
"60626",1215,"it's got double vanities you know it's","ep115"
"60627",1218,"nice that there's a double sink I really","ep115"
"60628",1221,"do like that but the cabinet's don't","ep115"
"60629",1224,"really seem to be updated and there's","ep115"
"60630",1227,"not much for storage in here I mean it","ep115"
"60631",1230,"definitely gets a job done but certainly","ep115"
"60632",1233,"it's not a really ideal bathroom that I","ep115"
"60633",1236,"was hoping for for the extra bedrooms","ep115"
"60634",1239,"and living space they head down to the","ep115"
"60635",1242,"basement all right Lindsay we have your","ep115"
"60636",1245,"finished basement perfect which has two","ep115"
"60637",1248,"bedrooms full bath and back here we have","ep115"
"60638",1251,"a nice family room beautiful look at","ep115"
"60639",1254,"just lots of room for Roz Lee and all of","ep115"
"60640",1257,"our cousins to play have a choice","ep115"
"60641",1260,"sitting around but it is a finished","ep115"
"60642",1263,"basement and I really didn't wanna","ep115"
"60643",1266,"because of the moisture issues and","ep115"
"60644",1269,"everything like that","ep115"
"60645",1272,"is there any like workspace down here","ep115"
"60646",1275,"that I could work on stuff in no the","ep115"
"60647",1278,"basement has no room for like workshop","ep115"
"60648",1281,"for you so I think we're going to go to","ep115"
"60649",1284,"the garage see if there's space up there","ep115"
"60650",1287,"for that oh this is disappointingly","ep115"
"60651",1290,"small yeah I don't know if this is gonna","ep115"
"60652",1293,"work for what you're looking for No","ep115"
"60653",1296,"[Music]","ep115"
"60654",1299,"to modern style but I mean it's kind of","ep115"
"60655",1302,"a compromise on both of our tastes","ep115"
"60656",1305,"yeah the fireplace was cozy the beams","ep115"
"60657",1308,"were a nice touch to it as well","ep115"
"60658",1311,"I like finished basement so of course","ep115"
"60659",1314,"I'm gonna like that and it had five","ep115"
"60660",1317,"bedrooms I mean the the last two","ep115"
"60661",1320,"bedrooms down there so it's plenty of","ep115"
"60662",1323,"space we wouldn't have to remodel","ep115"
"60663",1326,"anything but but no work space down in","ep115"
"60664",1329,"the basement yeah I have any idea where","ep115"
"60665",1332,"I put my tools I guess we could always","ep115"
"60666",1335,"build another shop outside of it big lot","ep115"
"60667",1338,"too so yeah think about the yard yeah","ep115"
"60668",1341,"there's a lot of potential in there","ep115"
"60669",1344,"since all of the houses came in under","ep115"
"60670",1347,"budget they'll have to decide what's","ep115"
"60671",1350,"most important a finished basement no","ep115"
"60672",1353,"renovations or being near a volunteer","ep115"
"60673",1356,"fire department","ep115"
"60674",1359,"well we've seen plenty of houses I think","ep115"
"60675",1362,"it's time that we get out of the in-laws","ep115"
"60676",1365,"house and make a decision on where we're","ep115"
"60677",1368,"actually going to end up","ep115"
"60678",1371,"[Music]","ep115"
"60679",1374,"working with a budget of 450,000 dollars","ep115"
"60680",1377,"Casey and Lindsay are looking to buy in","ep115"
"60681",1380,"the Sioux Falls area of South Dakota","ep115"
"60682",1383,"they've seen several options now they're","ep115"
"60683",1386,"ready to choose what did you think about","ep115"
"60684",1389,"the ranch-style house for three hundred","ep115"
"60685",1392,"and nine thousand you know I love that","ep115"
"60686",1395,"it's a ranch just because that's the","ep115"
"60687",1398,"style that I'm looking for and I love","ep115"
"60688",1401,"the yard that house is a major","ep115"
"60689",1404,"renovation nightmare but it was also so","ep115"
"60690",1407,"far under our budget that we could make","ep115"
"60691",1410,"it our own and put her and stamp on it","ep115"
"60692",1413,"and it did have all the bedrooms that","ep115"
"60693",1416,"had the shop and it met your","ep115"
"60694",1419,"requirements in the fire department","ep115"
"60695",1422,"it really did check off most of the","ep115"
"60696",1425,"things on our list but all I see is I","ep115"
"60697",1428,"was thinking about how are we ever going","ep115"
"60698",1431,"to find time to do these projects to fix","ep115"
"60699",1434,"up this house well so what do you think","ep115"
"60700",1437,"about the farmhouse style for 339,000","ep115"
"60701",1440,"I'd really liked the style of it and I","ep115"
"60702",1443,"loved that it was in the fire district I","ep115"
"60703",1446,"love the fact that it's pretty much","ep115"
"60704",1449,"move-in ready I love that kitchen I also","ep115"
"60705",1452,"loved how huge the master bedroom was in","ep115"
"60706",1455,"that bathroom it had a jetted tub it had","ep115"
"60707",1458,"a huge walk-in shower you know the the","ep115"
"60708",1461,"downside is that the house only had","ep115"
"60709",1464,"three bedrooms and I was really looking","ep115"
"60710",1467,"for at least four the nice part about","ep115"
"60711",1470,"that is that at least has room for those","ep115"
"60712",1473,"bedrooms in the basement but it didn't","ep115"
"60713",1476,"really have any workspace down there no","ep115"
"60714",1479,"workshop in the basement no workshop in","ep115"
"60715",1482,"the garage I guess we could always build","ep115"
"60716",1485,"another shop outside of it I think","ep115"
"60717",1488,"there's room in the corner a lot but","ep115"
"60718",1491,"we'd have to make that work with our","ep115"
"60719",1494,"budget so what about the contemporary","ep115"
"60720",1497,"home for 418,000 yeah I like the updates","ep115"
"60721",1500,"that they did to it that it was all done","ep115"
"60722",1503,"but we were in a more central part of","ep115"
"60723",1506,"Sioux Falls and that pretty much does","ep115"
"60724",1509,"away with any chance of being on any","ep115"
"60725",1512,"volunteer fire department but it was","ep115"
"60726",1515,"everything that we were looking for in a","ep115"
"60727",1518,"house in terms of the space the number","ep115"
"60728",1521,"of bedrooms means a yard but it didn't","ep115"
"60729",1524,"have a big enough garage and it didn't","ep115"
"60730",1527,"offer any like workspace in eshop area","ep115"
"60731",1530,"the garage was pretty small I don't know","ep115"
"60732",1533,"if there'd be even room to add on","ep115"
"60733",1536,"something there","ep115"
"60734",1539,"well we've seen plenty of houses I think","ep115"
"60735",1542,"it's time that we get out of the in-laws","ep115"
"60736",1545,"house and make a decision on where we're","ep115"
"60737",1548,"actually going to end up","ep115"
"60738",1551,"I think I know what you want and as much","ep115"
"60739",1554,"as I want a ranch I think that farmhouse","ep115"
"60740",1557,"style is a perfect house for us I think","ep115"
"60741",1560,"it is - it's good with our budget big","ep115"
"60742",1563,"master bedroom and master bathroom and","ep115"
"60743",1566,"it's not a lot of projects and","ep115"
"60744",1569,"renovations that we're gonna be walking","ep115"
"60745",1572,"into and I think after we build the shop","ep115"
"60746",1575,"well the perfect house yeah I agree","ep115"
"60747",1578,"um maybe after we finished the basement","ep115"
"60748",1581,"but yeah that's a dress that in the","ep115"
"60749",1584,"future","ep115"
"60750",1587,"should we go chase a puppy you go chase","ep115"
"60751",1590,"a puppy's we've been living in the home","ep115"
"60752",1593,"for about three weeks now and it feels","ep115"
"60753",1596,"just so nice to be settled in to be","ep115"
"60754",1599,"getting comfortable and making it our","ep115"
"60755",1602,"own Oh the house was listed for $339,000","ep115"
"60756",1605,"couple of changes to the house already","ep115"
"60757",1608,"we've changed paint colors in a couple","ep115"
"60758",1611,"rooms we've replaced light fixtures in","ep115"
"60759",1614,"the majority of the house we've got new","ep115"
"60760",1617,"curtains new furniture things like that","ep115"
"60761",1620,"just really decorated and made it our","ep115"
"60762",1623,"own we could have put our bed sheets","ep115"
"60763",1626,"over the windows that would have worked","ep115"
"60764",1629,"just fine this is not our college dorm","ep115"
"60765",1632,"room dear this is our nice new house so","ep115"
"60766",1635,"we chose this house because you walk in","ep115"
"60767",1638,"and it has that cozy feel it's full of","ep115"
"60768",1641,"charm it's full of character it's four","ep115"
"60769",1644,"blocks away from the fire department and","ep115"
"60770",1647,"eventually we're gonna get a workshop","ep115"
"60771",1650,"built in the side yards after that's","ep115"
"60772",1653,"done it's in my mind the perfect home","ep115"
"60773",1656,"this house is perfect in terms of size","ep115"
"60774",1659,"for us right now","ep115"
"60775",1662,"eventually when our family does grow","ep115"
"60776",1665,"we've got room in the basement to finish","ep115"
"60777",1668,"that up and create more bedrooms if","ep115"
"60778",1671,"needed the part of the house that I like","ep115"
"60779",1674,"best is the music room we spend so much","ep115"
"60780",1677,"family time in there it's it's really","ep115"
"60781",1680,"been a wonderful space together okay I","ep115"

"60844",177,"just absolutely fell in love with a","ep116"
"60845",180,"mid-century modern style that aesthetic","ep116"
"60846",183,"really appeals to the way I want to live","ep116"
"60847",186,"which is just simplicity a lot of light","ep116"
"60848",189,"kind of big open spaces for us we don't","ep116"
"60849",192,"want just a plain house to us a house is","ep116"

"60852",201,"the entrance and I do love the bright","ep116"

"60858",219,"go much above that what I want in a home","ep116"

"60860",225,"I would love the rooms to be a larger","ep116"
"60861",228,"size and what we currently have","ep116"
"60862",231,"especially for the kids as they're","ep116"

"60904",357,"a little outside their target area about","ep116"
"60905",360,"11 miles from downtown it is absolutely","ep116"
"60906",363,"hard to find a mid-century of modern","ep116"
"60907",366,"home like this they're very rare so when","ep116"
"60908",369,"they come on the market they seek them","ep116"

"60910",375,"little far from work it will be so far","ep116"
"60911",378,"for me probably 45 minutes to an hour hi","ep116"

"60926",423,"gotta agree these windows are awesome","ep116"
"60927",426,"and I love the view to the outside it's","ep116"
"60928",429,"the pool the only thing I would say is","ep116"
"60929",432,"that I was sort of looking for a big","ep116"
"60930",435,"open space where everyone can gather and","ep116"
"60931",438,"this seems cut off from everything else","ep116"
"60932",441,"but what's on the other side of the wall","ep116"
"60933",444,"the kitchen's on the other side oh this","ep116"
"60934",447,"is a great kitchen I think when you","ep116"
"60935",450,"remodel a mid-century home you just have","ep116"
"60936",453,"to do it right and they would definitely","ep116"
"60937",456,"do it the right way it is nice but I","ep116"
"60938",459,"don't see really any room where we can","ep116"
"60939",462,"kind of put our own personal touches on","ep116"
"60940",465,"it I just kind of feel that you know at","ep116"
"60941",468,"this price point I'm kind of paying for","ep116"
"60942",471,"somebody else's ideas that's what I like","ep116"
"60943",474,"about it everything is done","ep116"
"60944",477,"I think our furniture will fit in here","ep116"
"60945",480,"perfectly and I like how you have the","ep116"
"60946",483,"dining area here but then you can also","ep116"
"60947",486,"have people sit outside as well in the","ep116"
"60948",489,"backyard this bathroom is really cute I","ep116"
"60949",492,"love the color there storage in two","ep116"
"60950",495,"different spots and I love have the","ep116"

"60952",501,"is this the bedroom right here yes it is","ep116"
"60953",504,"this is a really big room this will be","ep116"
"60954",507,"perfect for our daughter","ep116"
"60955",510,"yeah this is a great size for is the","ep116"
"60956",513,"master bedroom like this oh well let's","ep116"
"60957",516,"go take a look it's next oh it's big","ep116"
"60958",519,"it's just perfect yeah you can","ep116"
"60959",522,"definitely fit a nice big king-size bed","ep116"
"60960",525,"in here yeah that is true okay so this","ep116"
"60961",528,"closets not huge but do you think the","ep116"
"60962",531,"two of us can fit our clothes in there","ep116"
"60963",534,"we can definitely fit a lot of shoes in","ep116"
"60964",537,"there that is true and then is that the","ep116"
"60965",540,"master bathroom it is what's really nice","ep116"
"60966",543,"is all the finishes have been updated","ep116"
"60967",546,"recently it looks really great it seems","ep116"
"60968",549,"to match with everything else that's in","ep116"
"60969",552,"the house one thing though it's not","ep116"
"60970",555,"gonna work for us to get ready at the","ep116"
"60971",558,"same time because it's just one area not","ep116"
"60972",561,"two separate areas so that means two","ep116"
"60973",564,"people can't really get ready at the","ep116"
"60974",567,"same time","ep116"
"60975",570,"they see a third bedroom before heading","ep116"
"60976",573,"outside to a casita you are looking for","ep116"
"60977",576,"a place to have a gym this just might","ep116"
"60978",579,"fit that bill oh wow this is great","ep116"
"60979",582,"I like how they kind of continue the","ep116"
"60980",585,"theme of the home it's almost like a","ep116"
"60981",588,"small replica of the house this is what","ep116"
"60982",591,"it's all about just the pool and then","ep116"
"60983",594,"you have all the lush greenery and the","ep116"
"60984",597,"trees","ep116"
"60985",600,"I love how relaxing and peaceful it is","ep116"
"60986",603,"out here I like all the greenery I like","ep116"
"60987",606,"the mature Japanese maples they're","ep116"
"60988",609,"beautiful and as an added bonus we have","ep116"
"60989",612,"the hot tub over there that is nice so","ep116"
"60990",615,"what did you think about the home what","ep116"
"60991",618,"were your impressions well first off let","ep116"
"60992",621,"me go off what I did like the master","ep116"
"60993",624,"bathroom it doesn't have the two","ep116"
"60994",627,"separate areas and for me I'd like to","ep116"
"60995",630,"maybe put my touch on it a little bit","ep116"
"60996",633,"and it didn't really have any room for","ep116"
"60997",636,"projects for me I do like the house","ep116"
"60998",639,"though I think it had some great points","ep116"
"60999",642,"as well I love the kitchen and left all","ep116"
"61000",645,"the bathrooms all those updates are just","ep116"
"61001",648,"really what I want I don't want to have","ep116"
"61002",651,"to do anything myself I feel like we","ep116"
"61003",654,"could just come in move in our things","ep116"
"61004",657,"and just enjoy it","ep116"
"61005",660,"and of course the backyard was great I","ep116"
"61006",663,"think the biggest problem for me though","ep116"
"61007",666,"is that it is so far from my job so","ep116"
"61008",669,"their agent finds an option closer to","ep116"
"61009",672,"Sacramento but I can actually hear the","ep116"
"61010",675,"freeway I don't like that","ep116"
"61011",678,"[Music]","ep116"
"61012",681,"I love this table it actually seats six","ep116"
"61013",684,"people and these chairs Wow","ep116"
"61014",687,"Alejo and Gisela are moving from the","ep116"
"61015",690,"suburbs to be closer to downtown","ep116"
"61016",693,"Sacramento California they're only","ep116"
"61017",696,"interested in a mid-century modern house","ep116"
"61018",699,"that they can buy with their budget of","ep116"
"61019",702,"around $600,000 so far they've seen an","ep116"
"61020",705,"updated home that was move-in ready","ep116"
"61021",708,"perfect for Gisela but not for Alejo","ep116"
"61022",711,"who's looking forward to putting his own","ep116"
"61023",714,"stamp on a home and it was located about","ep116"
"61024",717,"11 miles from downtown Sacramento a","ep116"
"61025",720,"little farther than they want to be so","ep116"
"61026",723,"today they're seeing another option this","ep116"
"61027",726,"time closer to downtown this house is","ep116"
"61028",729,"actually a good location because I can","ep116"
"61029",732,"get to the freeway pretty quickly but at","ep116"
"61030",735,"the same time I can actually hear the","ep116"
"61031",738,"freeway yeah I don't like that hi Gisela","ep116"
"61032",741,"welcome I have another mid-century","ep116"
"61033",744,"modern home to show you a four-bedroom","ep116"
"61034",747,"two-bathroom home fantastic price tag at","ep116"
"61035",750,"500,000 whoa I love the price on that","ep116"
"61036",753,"that's really good price what do you","ep116"
"61037",756,"think of the curb appeal this wall right","ep116"
"61038",759,"here is a little crazy","ep116"
"61039",762,"I guess if we ever had like a zombie","ep116"
"61040",765,"apocalypse would be safe oh we get","ep116"
"61041",768,"inside you'll see it forms a nice little","ep116"
"61042",771,"courtyard so you might like that Wow I","ep116"
"61043",774,"don't really hear the traffic noise as","ep116"
"61044",777,"much in here yeah now the brick wall it","ep116"
"61045",780,"actually makes sense because it makes","ep116"
"61046",783,"everything feel nice and peaceful in","ep116"
"61047",786,"here and I actually kind of liked it","ep116"
"61048",789,"what I do really like are the big","ep116"
"61049",792,"sliders and how it has a view of the","ep116"
"61050",795,"kitchen so you can make dinner and then","ep116"
"61051",798,"bring your food outside and enjoy it","ep116"
"61052",801,"outside in this beautiful courtyard no","ep116"
"61053",804,"that's definitely a plus yeah I'm ready","ep116"
"61054",807,"to head on inside","ep116"
"61055",810,"yeah don't worry Wow I love all these","ep116"
"61056",813,"windows I love this brick this is","ep116"
"61057",816,"actually the same brick that's out front","ep116"
"61058",819,"and I do like it this is multi right","ep116"
"61059",822,"sure does not fit into the style so","ep116"
"61060",825,"definitely something that I could take","ep116"
"61061",828,"off and then if you look at the floor","ep116"
"61062",831,"the floor needs to go but I actually","ep116"
"61063",834,"like that because I think me and my","ep116"
"61064",837,"brother can come in","ep116"
"61065",840,"make it into something really nice okay","ep116"
"61066",843,"that's gonna take time and money to do","ep116"
"61067",846,"put your own stamp on it so it would be","ep116"
"61068",849,"pretty cool when I think about how","ep116"
"61069",852,"demanding his job is and how he gets","ep116"
"61070",855,"home and he's really tired I just don't","ep116"
"61071",858,"see how he's gonna have the time and the","ep116"
"61072",861,"energy to renovate this house this","ep116"
"61073",864,"sounds really strange but I love and","ep116"
"61074",867,"hate this kitchen at the same time I","ep116"
"61075",870,"love these cabinets I wouldn't change","ep116"
"61076",873,"them I actually like the flat front","ep116"
"61077",876,"I love the knobs but I definitely","ep116"
"61078",879,"replaced the countertops","ep116"
"61079",882,"check out the appliances though they","ep116"
"61080",885,"look brand there and you have gas stove","ep116"
"61081",888,"top too which is kind of yes but look","ep116"
"61082",891,"how low this is I mean I do love these","ep116"
"61083",894,"long countertops but again they're","ep116"
"61084",897,"pretty low the kitchen can use some","ep116"
"61085",900,"improvement maybe the countertops so I","ep116"
"61086",903,"do see a lot of room for improvement","ep116"
"61087",906,"here and that's something that I","ep116"
"61088",909,"definitely like next they see the","ep116"
"61089",912,"backyard it is a very lush back here","ep116"
"61090",915,"which I do like I like all the trees and","ep116"
"61091",918,"mature birch trees the greenery is great","ep116"
"61092",921,"but do you think a pool will be able to","ep116"
"61093",924,"actually fit you can get a pool in this","ep116"
"61094",927,"backyard but it is going to take that","ep116"
"61095",930,"but good portion of your yard so we","ep116"
"61096",933,"could potentially lose all of the screen","ep116"
"61097",936,"rate yes I think I'm okay with that as","ep116"
"61098",939,"long as we have the pool back inside","ep116"
"61099",942,"they take a look at the bedrooms this","ep116"
"61100",945,"will work I think the kids will be happy","ep116"
"61101",948,"yeah it's a good size but as far for","ep116"
"61102",951,"sure please do that it just keeps going","ep116"
"61103",954,"and going and going and finding more and","ep116"
"61104",957,"more issues let's go look at the master","ep116"
"61105",960,"suite okay so kind of nice I mean it's a","ep116"
"61106",963,"good size it's not huge but that's okay","ep116"
"61107",966,"we are downsizing we can definitely fit","ep116"
"61108",969,"a king-sized bed in here and still have","ep116"
"61109",972,"a view and a nice big window so I","ep116"
"61110",975,"actually seen an attached bathroom there","ep116"
"61111",978,"is this is the master bath okay so I","ep116"
"61112",981,"like wood paneling but I don't even want","ep116"
"61113",984,"to say that this is wood I don't even","ep116"
"61114",987,"know what this is","ep116"
"61115",990,"that is a laminate treatment so it's","ep116"
"61116",993,"something that you would see on a floor","ep116"
"61117",996,"but they've put it on the wall what does","ep116"
"61118",999,"work is this vanity this floating vanity","ep116"
"61119",1002,"is actually","ep116"
"61120",1005,"it's something that I would keep and it","ep116"
"61121",1008,"has some extra storage here so that is","ep116"
"61122",1011,"good and then speaking of storage","ep116"
"61123",1014,"there's so okay this is the only closet","ep116"
"61124",1017,"then this is the only closet and in the","ep116"
"61125",1020,"bathroom and in the room good","ep116"
"61126",1023,"I I don't know what that fake wood","ep116"
"61127",1026,"paneling would have to go some of the","ep116"
"61128",1029,"things could stay but it is a little","ep116"
"61129",1032,"tight and then the closet is in the","ep116"
"61130",1035,"bathroom which I'm not a big fan of","ep116"
"61131",1038,"because if someone's using the sink then","ep116"
"61132",1041,"it's a little bit hard to get into the","ep116"
"61133",1044,"closet so here we have the shower but","ep116"
"61134",1047,"again there's that fake wood I think","ep116"
"61135",1050,"besides the fake what everything else","ep116"
"61136",1053,"looks pretty nice but yeah it just","ep116"
"61137",1056,"doesn't quite fit so what did you guys","ep116"
"61138",1059,"think of this home I love this courtyard","ep116"
"61139",1062,"this is probably my favorite feature I","ep116"
"61140",1065,"just love how it goes right into the","ep116"
"61141",1068,"kitchen area I think the big thing for","ep116"
"61142",1071,"me was that it didn't have the pool but","ep116"
"61143",1074,"maybe that's a good thing because we can","ep116"
"61144",1077,"design the pool how we want it the other","ep116"
"61145",1080,"thing is we can put our own personal","ep116"
"61146",1083,"touch on this we can come in and replace","ep116"
"61147",1086,"the floor put the floor that we like","ep116"
"61148",1089,"there's definitely room under the budget","ep116"
"61149",1092,"since this house is so cheap that's","ep116"
"61150",1095,"right at $500,000 I do like the price of","ep116"
"61151",1098,"the house but how much is it gonna cost","ep116"
"61152",1101,"to get this all done to get it the way","ep116"
"61153",1104,"that we want it it is a fixer that is","ep116"
"61154",1107,"kind of an issue for me and I really","ep116"
"61155",1110,"don't want to complicate my life yeah","ep116"
"61156",1113,"but I don't see that as a problem I see","ep116"
"61157",1116,"it as a plus","ep116"
"61158",1119,"so Raquel lines up a more move-in-ready","ep116"
"61159",1122,"option for Gisella located in a unique","ep116"
"61160",1125,"neighborhood","ep116"
"61161",1128,"I love the tree-lined streets yeah it's","ep116"
"61162",1131,"great definitely a really","ep116"

"61169",1152,"on finding the perfect mid-century","ep116"
"61170",1155,"modern to call home so far they've seen","ep116"
"61171",1158,"an updated home with a pool that was","ep116"
"61172",1161,"slightly outside their target area and a","ep116"
"61173",1164,"little over their budget then they saw a","ep116"
"61174",1167,"home with no pool in need of some work","ep116"
"61175",1170,"but with a lower price tag and much","ep116"
"61176",1173,"closer to downtown today the couple is","ep116"
"61177",1176,"looking at a home built by famed","ep116"
"61178",1179,"real-estate developer Joseph Eichler I","ep116"
"61179",1182,"love the tree-lined streets yeah it's","ep116"
"61180",1185,"great definitely a really","ep116"
"61181",1188,"well-established neighborhood","ep116"
"61182",1191,"Joseph Eifler in the 1950s started","ep116"
"61183",1194,"thinking outside the box instead of a","ep116"
"61184",1197,"traditional ranch-style home I wanted to","ep116"
"61185",1200,"add some modern tones and modern look to","ep116"
"61186",1203,"it well there's Raquel this must be the","ep116"
"61187",1206,"house right how are you great how are","ep116"

"61190",1215,"two-bath 1714 square feet and it's","ep116"
"61191",1218,"listed at a great price at 539 900 this","ep116"
"61192",1221,"glass is amazing this is what","ep116"
"61193",1224,"mid-century modern living is all about","ep116"
"61194",1227,"it's about bringing the outdoors in this","ep116"
"61195",1230,"is perfect","ep116"
"61196",1233,"Wow what do you think of these beams I","ep116"
"61197",1236,"love them I love the built-in cabinets","ep116"
"61198",1239,"and I know I'm trying to get rid of my","ep116"
"61199",1242,"stuff but a little extra storage is","ep116"
"61200",1245,"always good I could see my 60-inch TV","ep116"
"61201",1248,"right here I can be sitting back here","ep116"
"61202",1251,"looking out to the backyard","ep116"
"61203",1254,"they could work nicely did you see this","ep116"
"61204",1257,"wall it has a really neat texture I","ep116"
"61205",1260,"think it's the burlap wallpaper that I","ep116"
"61206",1263,"used to put in homes in the 50s and 60s","ep116"
"61207",1266,"and it looks like it's been repainted","ep116"
"61208",1269,"but I love this texture next they see","ep116"
"61209",1272,"the kitchen pretty much this is moving","ep116"
"61210",1275,"ready and I actually really like that","ep116"
"61211",1278,"because I know with kitchen remodels","ep116"
"61212",1281,"it's so expensive it takes so much time","ep116"
"61213",1284,"and we don't have to do anything about","ep116"
"61214",1287,"the backsplash though it's not crazy","ep116"
"61215",1290,"about that I mean that's a project that","ep116"
"61216",1293,"you could do it's not really what I","ep116"
"61217",1296,"would have done I think I would have","ep116"
"61218",1299,"done things a little differently just to","ep116"
"61219",1302,"put my own stamp on the house so are you","ep116"
"61220",1305,"ready to take a look at the bedrooms","ep116"
"61221",1308,"yeah","ep116"
"61222",1311,"let's go so I'm a little disappointed by","ep116"
"61223",1314,"the size of the room it's pretty small","ep116"
"61224",1317,"it's smaller than what the kids have","ep116"
"61225",1320,"right now when you go into the bedrooms","ep116"
"61226",1323,"they're just small and dark so that's a","ep116"
"61227",1326,"little bit disappointing to me let's go","ep116"
"61228",1329,"on into the master suite there's more","ep116"
"61229",1332,"closets as we're going down the hallway","ep116"
"61230",1335,"that's nice yeah sure so what I like is","ep116"
"61231",1338,"that it's been recently updated so","ep116"
"61232",1341,"there's no renovation no remodel nothing","ep116"
"61233",1344,"I like that yeah but you know we're kind","ep116"
"61234",1347,"of used to having two sinks and I know","ep116"
"61235",1350,"you tend to lock up the sink in the","ep116"
"61236",1353,"morning when getting ready so I might be","ep116"
"61237",1356,"late to work","ep116"
"61238",1359,"I hope they catch up and I think that","ep116"
"61239",1362,"we'll make it work this is what it's all","ep116"
"61240",1365,"about this is impressive this is really","ep116"
"61241",1368,"nice it's about bringing the outdoors in","ep116"
"61242",1371,"and looking out onto this what kind of","ep116"
"61243",1374,"concerns me is that it's actually kind","ep116"
"61244",1377,"of tight and we were actually thinking","ep116"
"61245",1380,"about getting the king honestly I don't","ep116"
"61246",1383,"I don't care about the size just like","ep116"
"61247",1386,"this this is exactly what I was talking","ep116"
"61248",1389,"about yeah this is great I think you","ep116"

"61255",1410,"lot of stuff we wanted I loved the","ep116"
"61256",1413,"backyard and the open space that looks","ep116"
"61257",1416,"out to the backyard with all the windows","ep116"
"61258",1419,"pretty amazing but I kind of feel like","ep116"
"61259",1422,"this is somebody else's creation their","ep116"
"61260",1425,"style and I don't really have a lot of","ep116"
"61261",1428,"room to put my own stamp on it but one","ep116"
"61262",1431,"thing I'm not too happy with or the size","ep116"
"61263",1434,"of the rooms they're a little too small","ep116"
"61264",1437,"[Music]","ep116"
"61265",1440,"with three mid-century homes to choose","ep116"
"61266",1443,"from it's going to come down to bedroom","ep116"
"61267",1446,"size proximity to town and whether or","ep116"
"61268",1449,"not they're willing to sacrifice a pool","ep116"

"61277",1476,"several houses and the time has come to","ep116"
"61278",1479,"make a decision the first house they saw","ep116"
"61279",1482,"was about 11 miles from downtown was","ep116"
"61280",1485,"that 675 which is above budget and don't","ep116"
"61281",1488,"really like that as far as all the","ep116"
"61282",1491,"finishes that had on it they did an","ep116"
"61283",1494,"amazing job the house is beautiful","ep116"
"61284",1497,"everything was done I mean that kitchen","ep116"
"61285",1500,"was unbelievable with the quartz","ep116"
"61286",1503,"countertops and that really nice","ep116"
"61287",1506,"cabinetry so I did like that I did like","ep116"
"61288",1509,"the floor-to-ceiling windows the","ep116"
"61289",1512,"backyard was beautiful and remember that","ep116"
"61290",1515,"little casita that we could use that was","ep116"
"61291",1518,"a nice spot for a gentleman but it is","ep116"
"61292",1521,"super far for both of us the next option","ep116"
"61293",1524,"was priced at $500,000 I think it was a","ep116"
"61294",1527,"great price and had a lot of room for","ep116"
"61295",1530,"improvement it had the four bedrooms","ep116"
"61296",1533,"also had that nice kitchen that had the","ep116"
"61297",1536,"sliding door going out to the courtyard","ep116"
"61298",1539,"and I'm really fearful that putting in a","ep116"
"61299",1542,"pool is gonna completely destroy the","ep116"
"61300",1545,"lush yard and then there's the eichler","ep116"
"61301",1548,"house for five hundred and forty","ep116"
"61302",1551,"thousand well the price was great I like","ep116"

"61308",1569,"like about it though is the kitchen was","ep116"
"61309",1572,"a little small and the rooms felt a","ep116"
"61310",1575,"little small and I know that you wanted","ep116"
"61311",1578,"to fix her but it's move-in ready so","ep116"

"61323",1614,"which we thought was a little bit low","ep116"
"61324",1617,"because we've been shopping in the area","ep116"
"61325",1620,"for several months and there's been","ep116"
"61326",1623,"occasions where there's like over 20","ep116"
"61327",1626,"offers on the same home so we knew","ep116"
"61328",1629,"coming into this that we would have to","ep116"
"61329",1632,"go well above the asking which we did","ep116"

"61342",1671,"totally get it you can repaint the walls","ep116"

"61517",504,"ready to make the switch to island life","ep117"
"61518",507,"but only with some help from her friends","ep117"
"61519",510,"Susan I met Susan when I was living here","ep117"
"61520",513,"before she was actually my massage","ep117"
"61521",516,"therapist we became friends and do a lot","ep117"
"61522",519,"of things together but I moved back to","ep117"
"61523",522,"California when my son was young but now","ep117"
"61524",525,"he's in college","ep117"
"61525",528,"emptiness Susan knows me well and that I","ep117"
"61526",531,"have a tendency to go big I'm a romantic","ep117"
"61527",534,"and so she knows that she needs to keep","ep117"
"61528",537,"me down to earth and focus on things","ep117"
"61529",540,"like my budget when Lynette left before","ep117"
"61530",543,"was kind of uh you know dark time for","ep117"
"61531",546,"all of us now I'm very happy that she's","ep117"
"61532",549,"back","ep117"
"61533",552,"it's a I'm happy to be back it's like a","ep117"
"61534",555,"new day you know new a new phase in her","ep117"
"61535",558,"life free and single it's very exciting","ep117"
"61536",561,"Cheers and that is a super fun we have","ep117"
"61537",564,"lots of fun together","ep117"
"61538",567,"we are definitely kindred spirits soul","ep117"
"61539",570,"sisters there you go boy that's so good","ep117"
"61540",573,"to be back mm-hmm","ep117"
"61541",576,"best margarita in the world I think that","ep117"
"61542",579,"though the way I can be of most help to","ep117"
"61543",582,"her is by keeping her reined in keep her","ep117"
"61544",585,"on her budget so she can stay here","ep117"
"61545",588,"and so we can have fun together get into","ep117"
"61546",591,"trouble get the trouble the first","ep117"
"61547",594,"apartments price is not what susan has","ep117"
"61548",597,"in mind asking prices went to 500 US","ep117"
"61549",600,"dollars I'm over my","ep117"
"61550",603,"but Lynette loves that it provides","ep117"
"61551",606,"access to the water at both the canal","ep117"
"61552",609,"and the beachfront so you get the best","ep117"
"61553",612,"of both worlds this is a beautiful view","ep117"
"61554",615,"now I see why this is $2,500 a month","ep117"
"61555",618,"this is a transitional time in Lynette's","ep117"
"61556",621,"life she's just out of a relationship","ep117"
"61557",624,"her son has grown and moved out for that","ep117"
"61558",627,"price I think you should really be","ep117"
"61559",630,"getting you know the most modern things","ep117"
"61560",633,"honestly the biggest challenge is Susan","ep117"
"61561",636,"Freeport Grand Bahama my strategy for","ep117"
"61562",639,"the next house perhaps not being as","ep117"
"61563",642,"close to the beach so that the asking","ep117"
"61564",645,"price would be a little lower we just","ep117"
"61565",648,"went over the bridge I think that's","ep117"
"61566",651,"moving away from town would you go over","ep117"
"61567",654,"the bridge how far is it to the beach","ep117"
"61568",657,"look at that view but you know when we","ep117"
"61569",660,"were driving here we went over that","ep117"
"61570",663,"bridge and it does seem a little bit","ep117"
"61571",666,"further than I would like it feels a","ep117"
"61572",669,"little remote it's too bad and Tuvok","ep117"
"61573",672,"what are they asking for this please","ep117"
"61574",675,"asking 2200 u.s. dollar okay four months","ep117"
"61575",678,"right at the top of your budget I know","ep117"
"61576",681,"but it's beautiful I love the yellow","ep117"
"61577",684,"color it reminds me of the islands it's","ep117"

"61877",120,"and Miguel moved to the San Fernando","ep118"
"61878",123,"Valley in Los Angeles right now we live","ep118"
"61879",126,"in a townhouse it's a little bit under a","ep118"
"61880",129,"thousand square feet so it's small it's","ep118"
"61881",132,"tight it's tight I need a kitchen island","ep118"
"61882",135,"so rattly like especially with the","ep118"
"61883",138,"bathroom situation we knew it was a","ep118"
"61884",141,"starter home but I don't like that I","ep118"
"61885",144,"have shared walls I really just wanted a","ep118"
"61886",147,"single-family home that's how I grew up","ep118"
"61887",150,"I feel it's about time because prices","ep118"
"61888",153,"keep going up and I know there's not a","ep118"
"61889",156,"lot of inventory in the city I'm looking","ep118"
"61890",159,"for more of a traditional style so I","ep118"
"61891",162,"don't like the box feel of a modern home","ep118"
"61892",165,"I liked an a-frame and a porch just I","ep118"
"61893",168,"want it to be homey","ep118"
"61894",171,"but still modern I really like the","ep118"
"61895",174,"California ranch style with the clean","ep118"
"61896",177,"lines not too much decoration just","ep118"
"61897",180,"simple design I even I even don't mind","ep118"
"61898",183,"the boxy look of a house from the","ep118"
"61899",186,"outside","ep118"
"61900",189,"I like the bricks though I definitely","ep118"
"61901",192,"don't like the bricks all right I guess","ep118"
"61902",195,"we can compromise on that I just can't","ep118"
"61903",198,"stand breaks cuz it just it reminds me","ep118"
"61904",201,"of cold and sadness and just depression","ep118"
"61905",204,"if that makes any sense","ep118"
"61906",207,"I call it cozy I like Briggs we can","ep118"
"61907",210,"remove him I'm","ep118"
"61908",213,"say I would like three to four bedrooms","ep118"
"61909",216,"two bathrooms or more for sure I would","ep118"
"61910",219,"like to have a big updated kitchen","ep118"
"61911",222,"that's my dream and I would totally love","ep118"
"61912",225,"a pool because that means more party","ep118"
"61913",228,"central a/c would be ideal because one","ep118"
"61914",231,"of the bedrooms is definitely going to","ep118"
"61915",234,"become finally by dedicated studio I","ep118"
"61916",237,"mainly work from home and if it's not","ep118"
"61917",240,"cold in there then that's definitely a","ep118"
"61918",243,"problem and then also the space for for","ep118"
"61919",246,"the children","ep118"
"61920",249,"Panchito and Brutus there are babies","ep118"
"61921",252,"that's actually one of the reasons why","ep118"
"61922",255,"we want to move also to have a bigger","ep118"
"61923",258,"yard for them so they can run around a","ep118"
"61924",261,"cute boy another thing that's important","ep118"
"61925",264,"for me is the street if I feel like it's","ep118"
"61926",267,"gonna be a busy street or noisy -","ep118"
"61927",270,"deal-breaker for sure so with the price","ep118"
"61928",273,"they come with a price tag and that's","ep118"
"61929",276,"another thing rather than spending their","ep118"
"61930",279,"entire budget on something turnkey they","ep118"
"61931",282,"want to find a home for less and roll up","ep118"
"61932",285,"their sleeves our budget that we figured","ep118"
"61933",288,"out is five hundred thousand we're","ep118"
"61934",291,"willing to destroy the floors take out","ep118"
"61935",294,"the carpet paint the walls we're really","ep118"
"61936",297,"handy so we can do a lot of stuff and in","ep118"
"61937",300,"a way I'm I'm excited about something","ep118"
"61938",303,"like that because I can make it my own","ep118"
"61939",306,"from scratch to start their real-estate","ep118"

"62109",816,"laundry room yeah I do like the open","ep118"
"62110",819,"concept here on the ground floor","ep118"
"62111",822,"however the upstairs feels a little bit","ep118"
"62112",825,"cramped with the slanted ceilings if","ep118"
"62113",828,"anything else there's plenty of room","ep118"
"62114",831,"plenty of land you could if you wanted","ep118"

"62116",837,"property on this lot off set the","ep118"
"62117",840,"mortgage payment I was going to say","ep118"

"62119",846,"a lot can you maybe show us some","ep118"
"62120",849,"properties that are a little bit closer","ep118"
"62121",852,"to our budget I'll see what I can do","ep118"
"62122",855,"since Carla and Miguel are concerned","ep118"

"62132",885,"single-family home in Los Angeles","ep118"
"62133",888,"they're very specific which is great but","ep118"
"62134",891,"in the Los Angeles market right now it's","ep118"
"62135",894,"tough to find a house in the price point","ep118"
"62136",897,"that they want so far they've seen a","ep118"
"62137",900,"traditional house with a pool that would","ep118"
"62138",903,"require extensive renovations then they","ep118"
"62139",906,"saw an updated ranch on a half acre but","ep118"
"62140",909,"it was way over budget so now Kurt is","ep118"
"62141",912,"lined up a home he thinks will satisfy","ep118"
"62142",915,"their styles and wallets this house is","ep118"
"62143",918,"in a very nice neighborhood a little bit","ep118"
"62144",921,"out of the way away from the trendy","ep118"
"62145",924,"restaurants and some guesses but it's a","ep118"
"62146",927,"three-bedroom two-bathroom California","ep118"
"62147",930,"ranch built in 1952 just under 1,500","ep118"

"62149",936,"foot lot yeah it's nice it's authentic","ep118"

"62152",945,"bricks that's right I know you're","ep118"
"62153",948,"allergic to those and the good news is","ep118"
"62154",951,"it's just below your price point","ep118"
"62155",954,"$450,000 Wow Wow","ep118"
"62156",957,"that sounds really good yes what I'm","ep118"

"62192",1065,"furniture out of your own absolutely","ep118"
"62193",1068,"plenty of room for the daughter to play","ep118"
"62194",1071,"got a detached garage over here you","ep118"
"62195",1074,"could actually turn that into it either","ep118"
"62196",1077,"a guest bedroom or your studio yeah I","ep118"
"62197",1080,"guess this is the AC yeah you've got a","ep118"
"62198",1083,"newer air-conditioning that's really","ep118"
"62199",1086,"important yeah there's a lot of","ep118"
"62200",1089,"surprises in that backyard","ep118"
"62201",1092,"oh it goes all the way around yeah","ep118"
"62202",1095,"there's also a lot of space I could do","ep118"
"62203",1098,"some gardening I could make it pretty","ep118"
"62204",1101,"and I could sit on jitu having a lot of","ep118"
"62205",1104,"fun oh yeah look at all this space","ep118"
"62206",1107,"you could even put a pool in here I'm","ep118"
"62207",1110,"hearing a lot of places are we in a","ep118"
"62208",1113,"light path yeah there's a private","ep118"
"62209",1116,"airfield up a couple blocks away oh you","ep118"
"62210",1119,"could hear we're planes and planes and","ep118"
"62211",1122,"planes I don't even know how many","ep118"
"62212",1125,"airports are out there but it seems like","ep118"
"62213",1128,"50 so that's a lot of noise","ep118"
"62214",1131,"what do you want for 500,000 back inside","ep118"
"62215",1134,"they see two guest bedrooms and the","ep118"
"62216",1137,"second bathroom there's potential to put","ep118"
"62217",1140,"a second sink but it is pretty narrow so","ep118"
"62218",1143,"it would still be cut on top of each","ep118"
"62219",1146,"other and this is the master bedroom","ep118"
"62220",1149,"wow this is nice and big yeah that's a","ep118"
"62221",1152,"good size yeah it was added on I can see","ep118"
"62222",1155,"her bed fitting here oh I like the","ep118"
"62223",1158,"closets and it was very bright there's","ep118"
"62224",1161,"actually a great house you showed us","ep118"
"62225",1164,"your cards there's a fairly new AC and","ep118"
"62226",1167,"the price is great yeah","ep118"
"62227",1170,"both of the bathrooms seem like they're","ep118"
"62228",1173,"really tight though I don't know if","ep118"
"62229",1176,"that's gonna be enough space for us it's","ep118"
"62230",1179,"a really nice backyard and I can see us","ep118"
"62231",1182,"hanging out here but what I don't like","ep118"
"62232",1185,"is that those planes yeah you're gonna","ep118"
"62233",1188,"hear a little bit know everything it's","ep118"
"62234",1191,"not an airplane you're gonna hear a","ep118"
"62235",1194,"freeway so I mean pick your poison what","ep118"
"62236",1197,"do you think about it yeah Carla and","ep118"
"62237",1200,"Miguel must now decide on whether they","ep118"
"62238",1203,"want to roll up their sleeves or stretch","ep118"
"62239",1206,"their budget","ep118"
"62240",1209,"like deal with this","ep118"
"62241",1212,"[Music]","ep118"
"62242",1215,"okay Miguel we have a decision to make","ep118"
"62243",1218,"yeah Karla and Miguel have five hundred","ep118"
"62244",1221,"thousand dollars to spend on a","ep118"
"62245",1224,"single-family home after seeing a number","ep118"
"62246",1227,"of places it's time to decide so first","ep118"
"62247",1230,"we have the traditional house with a","ep118"
"62248",1233,"pool at 479 900 it is underneath our","ep118"
"62249",1236,"budget I feel like there's a lot of work","ep118"
"62250",1239,"to be done in that house","ep118"
"62251",1242,"we have to completely redo that kitchen","ep118"
"62252",1245,"I mean that pink yes yeah it has no a/c","ep118"
"62253",1248,"that would be a big expense on the","ep118"
"62254",1251,"upside my favorite things was to pool","ep118"
"62255",1254,"the backyard itself why it is yeah I","ep118"
"62256",1257,"like that neighborhood there's so much","ep118"
"62257",1260,"potential we can really make it our own","ep118"
"62258",1263,"and the budget would allow for that next","ep118"
"62259",1266,"is a ranch on a half acre listed at six","ep118"
"62260",1269,"hundred and forty nine thousand the","ep118"
"62261",1272,"price on that house is really high but","ep118"
"62262",1275,"considering the size of the land I mean","ep118"
"62263",1278,"here in California it has a lot of value","ep118"
"62264",1281,"there's so much potential to put in a","ep118"
"62265",1284,"pool to turn that detached garage into a","ep118"
"62266",1287,"studio or even into a rental property","ep118"
"62267",1290,"and make up for the difference that way","ep118"
"62268",1293,"that house was nice of all three houses","ep118"
"62269",1296,"that kitchen that's the best one we've","ep118"
"62270",1299,"seen yeah let's talk about the 50s","ep118"
"62271",1302,"California ranch house that one was at","ep118"
"62272",1305,"450,000 way below our budget and it has","ep118"
"62273",1308,"central a/c already I mean I'm really","ep118"
"62274",1311,"glad that they updated the house I mean","ep118"
"62275",1314,"owners 65 years you walk in there and","ep118"
"62276",1317,"you feel like you're in the 50s","ep118"
"62277",1320,"I know it's below our budget but I'm","ep118"
"62278",1323,"concerned about the area I wasn't too","ep118"
"62279",1326,"fond about all the noise and the plains","ep118"
"62280",1329,"remember the plains yeah it's pretty","ep118"

"63061",339,"exterior of this house is exactly what","ep120"
"63062",342,"I'm looking for not logs I am really","ep120"
"63063",345,"liking the stone and you know what I'm","ep120"

"63070",366,"actually does kind of give me a feeling","ep120"
"63071",369,"of the log cabin yeah it might be a","ep120"
"63072",372,"little too much wood for me though stone","ep120"
"63073",375,"fireplace which is great picks that like","ep120"
"63074",378,"stone from the outside and actually","ep120"
"63075",381,"brings it inside very cozy and it's huge","ep120"

"63084",408,"prefer a lighter color and another","ep120"
"63085",411,"strange feature is I'm not exactly sure","ep120"
"63086",414,"what the two different heights are and","ep120"
"63087",417,"then this piece in between I'd prefer","ep120"

"63097",447,"little strange overall I think this","ep120"
"63098",450,"kitchen is gonna have to go total","ep120"
"63099",453,"renovation but as long as I'm renovating","ep120"
