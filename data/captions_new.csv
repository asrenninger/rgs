1,ep121,"This is a huge, hugs room."
2,ep121,It definitely fits me.
3,ep121,Shaunda will only accept here best in her first home in Georgia.
4,ep121,[all laughing]
5,ep121,"No! floor, you know, it just..."
6,ep121,reeks out at me like...
7,ep121,"-Oh, come-- Oh, come on!"
8,ep121,I want to it sparkle.
9,ep121,I want that wow factor.
10,ep121,"As a single mom, keeping her spending in check is also a priority."
11,ep121,"So, her agent has a tough road ahead."
12,ep121,I would love a tile shower.
13,ep121,"We know things like that cost money, right?"
14,ep121,"With this particular home, not only are we dealing with the market, we're dealing with the fact that this is the last lot in this neighborhood."
15,ep121,"Pressure, pressure, pressure."
16,ep121,-No pressure.
17,ep121,-Pressure. pressure.
18,ep121,"-It's pressure, girl."
19,ep121,[doorbell rings]
20,ep121,[opening theme music playing]
21,ep121,Did you complete your homework?
22,ep121,-I've been...
23,ep121,-That's a yes or no question.
24,ep121,I was born and raised here in Atlanta.
25,ep121,I am a Georgia peach.
26,ep121,And I'm a project program coordinator for a large healthcare organization.
27,ep121,Why don't you come and help me make a snack.
28,ep121,All right.
29,ep121,I'm a single mom.
30,ep121,"My son lives with me and my father, he comes over a lot."
31,ep121,He is a part-time resident.
32,ep121,"Next, we are gonna go for the grapes."
33,ep121,"Xavier, he's 12-years-old and he's the love of my life."
34,ep121,That's my little munchkin.
35,ep121,"-Here, Mama."
36,ep121,I got it.
37,ep121,I got it.
38,ep121,-You got it?
39,ep121,I'm currently renting on the outskirts of Atlanta.
40,ep121,I am tired of renting and it will mean so much to me to own a home.
41,ep121,This is something that I just been wanting to do for years.
42,ep121,"And I decided to cut down on shopping, even in wigs for my hair."
43,ep121,"So, just, uh, I just cut down all the unnecessary expenses so that way I can just save."
44,ep121,"Take this on the table -and I'll go get the door, okay?"
45,ep121,-All right.
46,ep121,"As a first time home buyer, I don't know everything."
47,ep121,"My real estate agent, Leslie, she's awesome."
48,ep121,-Hey! to buy a house?
49,ep121,My focus is the first time home buyer.
50,ep121,The challenge is the expectations.
51,ep121,I had to bring them back to earth.
52,ep121,"I want the bells and whistles The bells and the whistles Yes, the bells and the whistles"
53,ep121,[both laughing]
54,ep121,And I think Shaunda is coming in with all those big expectations.
55,ep121,She isn't ready for the harsh reality that Atlanta real estate is crazy right now.
56,ep121,"So, you've got to pay to play."
57,ep121,I've been approved at 400K.
58,ep121,"-Okay, nice."
59,ep121,Nice. want to stay around 300.
60,ep121,It is going to be very competitive.
61,ep121,I don't want to be house poor.
62,ep121,I want to make sure that I'm making good financial decision for myself and my son.
63,ep121,What particular areas in Atlanta are you thinking?
64,ep121,"Something quiet, suburban, where kids are around so that my son can make friends I'm looking for, like, a traditional style house."
65,ep121,"-Okay. dad, he's gonna be, like, a part-time resident So, an extra bedroom will be definitely helpful for him to have somewhere to sleep."
66,ep121,That's good for me to know.
67,ep121,-That little sparkly stuff.
68,ep121,-Okay. I see.
69,ep121,"-Mm-hmm. yes, I want the house to reflect my personality."
70,ep121,Okay. want it to sparkle.
71,ep121,"So, I want that wow factor."
72,ep121,My preference is new construction.
73,ep121,"Basically, it hasn't been lived in."
74,ep121,I don't want to sit on nobody's old toilet.
75,ep121,"Please, be open to resale because we can always replace the toilet."
76,ep121,-True. I don't wanna pull a carpet and all that stuff.
77,ep121,-Okay. you don't want a project?
78,ep121,-Mmh-mmh. I want in my new home...
79,ep121,-closet space.
80,ep121,-Big closet.
81,ep121,"-Right. I want extra space for my wigs, -shoes, purses."
82,ep121,-Okay. your pet peeve are small closets?
83,ep121,Yes Somebody's been pressuring me to get a dog.
84,ep121,"I want this big backyard where, where me and the dog can, like, go running and fetching and stuff because, like, I want this Doberman."
85,ep121,"Okay, let's see what we can do."
86,ep121,"Like, a basement..."
87,ep121,where I can make music and stuff.
88,ep121,"His passion right now is music, so he would love to use that space to have a music studio."
89,ep121,I would also like to have a long drive way.
90,ep121,"-I like to entertain, so I want..."
91,ep121,-Right. for my guests to be able to park.
92,ep121,"So, you're not gonna get everything you want for $300,000, but I just want you to know all of your options."
93,ep121,We are visiting a new construction community in Conyers.
94,ep121,You're all about the new.
95,ep121,I am all about the new-new I think you'll be pleased but we'll see because you know you.
96,ep121,"This one's gonna be $300,000 That's not too bad."
97,ep121,"-Uh, um, okay."
98,ep121,"-Guess what, Xavier?"
99,ep121,-What? get a pool.
100,ep121,Ooh. still building.
101,ep121,"If you want a new home, you have to expect there to be some construction of the new home."
102,ep121,This driveway is a tad bit short.
103,ep121,It is a bit of a shorter driveway.
104,ep121,How often are you gonna have guests?
105,ep121,"You're gonna have friends over here and there, so they can always park on the street."
106,ep121,"So, that's not much of a tradeoff to get new construction."
107,ep121,And look at this home.
108,ep121,The brick color is really nice.
109,ep121,I like that brick color.
110,ep121,You can never go wrong with a porch in Georgia.
111,ep121,-I know.
112,ep121,"Right. know, I can see patio furniture out here."
113,ep121,"Have, like, two chairs, -a table right there, yeah."
114,ep121,-Exactly. wow!
115,ep121,I love the wrought iron railing.
116,ep121,"Oh, coffered ceiling."
117,ep121,A lot of personality and detail as soon as you walk into your home.
118,ep121,"Me being a very detailed-oriented person, this house has a lot of detail that caught my eye, like the wall trimmings, the coffered ceiling."
119,ep121,"So, I was just like, ""Oooh."""
120,ep121,"I like this chandelier that you pointed out, Xavier."
121,ep121,"It's cute, is it?"
122,ep121,I would give it a thumbs up of approval.
123,ep121,"-So, I am noticing the carpet."
124,ep121,"-Mm-hmm. we're having dinner here, it's gonna be a nightmare trying to keep that clean."
125,ep121,All right.
126,ep121,Check out this kitchen.
127,ep121,-Huh? love this island!
128,ep121,You see the island?
129,ep121,Yes. granite countertops.
130,ep121,I like that.
131,ep121,I love the color of the cabinets.
132,ep121,It's so tall.
133,ep121,-Oh. in this home is built to give you that luxe feel.
134,ep121,"I love the kitchen but this floor, you know, it just..."
135,ep121,reeks out at me like...
136,ep121,"-Oh, come-- Oh, come on."
137,ep121,I just like the wood look.
138,ep121,"Remember, you're trying to stay within a certain price."
139,ep121,-In order to that...
140,ep121,-Yeah. to make a few sacrifices.
141,ep121,"I expected a little bit more from a $300,000 house, that the floor would be a little bit more up-to-date."
142,ep121,Shaunda's been quite demanding.
143,ep121,"If she wants to stay within a certain price range, I want het her to know that she may not get everything she wants out the gate, but she can always add it later on."
144,ep121,Can we look out here?
145,ep121,"Sure, we can go out there."
146,ep121,I like the size of this deck.
147,ep121,Doesn't a look like it's a whole lot of yard.
148,ep121,"With new construction, you do sacrifice a bit of that yard space..."
149,ep121,Okay. still has plenty of room to play around.
150,ep121,"Yeah, it's decent."
151,ep121,"Well, as you see, it unfinished."
152,ep121,It looks spacious.
153,ep121,They've done a quite a bit to it to give it a good foundation...
154,ep121,-Mm-hmm. to build out from there.
155,ep121,"-Desk, desk, TV..."
156,ep121,-What you got going on over here?
157,ep121,-A counter?
158,ep121,A desk?
159,ep121,-He's in his own little world.
160,ep121,I'm in my own world right now.
161,ep121,-[Leslie laughs]
162,ep121,I noticed.
163,ep121,He's planned it out to the T.
164,ep121,"As soon as you get up here, you are welcomed by an oasis."
165,ep121,This owner suite is amazing.
166,ep121,"This is a huge, huge room."
167,ep121,It definitely fits me.
168,ep121,Take a look at this bathroom.
169,ep121,"Oh, this is light and bright."
170,ep121,Go ahead and step in and see it's enough room for you to move around.
171,ep121,-Enough room for you to move around?
172,ep121,-Let me check and see.
173,ep121,Okay. Uh-huh.
174,ep121,[Leslie laughs]
175,ep121,It's missing...
176,ep121,I would love for it to have a tile shower.
177,ep121,"We know things like that cost money, right?"
178,ep121,"If you want to do tile, that's something we can add down the line."
179,ep121,Mm-hmm. out this closet.
180,ep121,This is huge.
181,ep121,I knew you were gonna like that.
182,ep121,More space for my wigs.
183,ep121,"Maybe I can put, like, a little chandelier or something."
184,ep121,Definitely put a chandelier.
185,ep121,Yay! will be too cute.
186,ep121,I would love it.
187,ep121,One of the secondary bedrooms.
188,ep121,"This would be a my size closet just for you, right?"
189,ep121,"Yes, this is mines."
190,ep121,I actually like having Xavier involved the process.
191,ep121,I like to hear his point of view of things.
192,ep121,He's just claiming everything.
193,ep121,"So, he's already given his stamp of approval 50 times, so."
194,ep121,He loves this house.
195,ep121,There is another room and I think that one will be better suited for grandpa.
196,ep121,"This one isn't a walk-in closet, but you still get a lot of -closet space."
197,ep121,-Okay. that view.
198,ep121,Nice. do love the details.
199,ep121,"I love coffered ceilings, and I love the kitchen."
200,ep121,I'm just still a little iffy about this carpet.
201,ep121,"You know, if I'm paying $300,000, I just want the whole shebang."
202,ep121,"I would like to see something with a bigger yard, uh, a longer driveway, and I want, like, the hardwood floors all throughout the house."
203,ep121,"So, I'll find you something with a bigger yard, but be prepared, -it's probably not gonna be new construction."
204,ep121,"What do you have a taste for, for lunch?"
205,ep121,I think I have a taste for steak.
206,ep121,"Oh, steak?"
207,ep121,"Well, there you go."
208,ep121,Expensive taste.
209,ep121,Xavier's a chip off the old block when it comes to wanting the best.
210,ep121,"His mom, Shaunda's been saving up to buy their first home, but she's having a hard time accepting that $300,000 might not go as far as she'd like."
211,ep121,Look at this yard.
212,ep121,"Hey, guys, What do you think?"
213,ep121,"Oh, my God!"
214,ep121,I am speechless.
215,ep121,"Today, I'm showing Shaunda this amazing house in Conyers."
216,ep121,"It's is listed at $295,000."
217,ep121,"Shaunda's a bit of a diva, so I'm hoping she doesn't hate it because it's not new construction."
218,ep121,It does have a few bumps and bruises.
219,ep121,"You got your nice, long driveway."
220,ep121,-You see that?
221,ep121,-I see.
222,ep121,How many cars can this fit?
223,ep121,"At least six, seven."
224,ep121,-You'll be able to entertain like you want.
225,ep121,"-Yes. got you a lot of curb appeal, but the inside, it is gonna need just a little bit of love Oh, wow."
226,ep121,I love the floor.
227,ep121,The floors have been refinished.
228,ep121,Yeah. chandelier is nice.
229,ep121,Is that the sparkle you were going for?
230,ep121,"Ooh, yes."
231,ep121,That's a lot of sparkle.
232,ep121,-I like it.
233,ep121,-A lot of sparkle.
234,ep121,I like the ceiling.
235,ep121,"Love the ceilings, right?"
236,ep121,Yes. fireplace is nice.
237,ep121,Yeah. it opens right into your kitchen.
238,ep121,No island.
239,ep121,You can always get one of those rollers if you need some extra counter space.
240,ep121,I also noticed the counter tops.
241,ep121,"So, the counter tops are a little dated."
242,ep121,"-So, that's gonna be a little..."
243,ep121,-It is very dated.
244,ep121,...of tender loving care we talked about.
245,ep121,"Just thinking of the extra things that I would have to come up out the pocket for, so."
246,ep121,Yeah. house is listed at a good price.
247,ep121,"However, just considering the things that I have to purchase, it would definitely push me over my 300K threshold."
248,ep121,It's like a nice football field.
249,ep121,I love the yard space.
250,ep121,You can have how many ever dogs you want.
251,ep121,"Xavier, what, four dogs?"
252,ep121,"-One. got space for four, though."
253,ep121,"This is a nice yard, but I am not the type of person to have a riding lawnmower out here."
254,ep121,You can hire someone to some out...
255,ep121,"Yeah, that is an option but it's also an extra cost that I have to add in -There's your landscaper right there."
256,ep121,It's a good idea.
257,ep121,Good idea.
258,ep121,We've got a main suite built for a queen.
259,ep121,"Oh, wow."
260,ep121,I definitely like the cathedral ceilings.
261,ep121,It's really nice.
262,ep121,Let's take a look at this bathroom here.
263,ep121,All right.
264,ep121,This is nice.
265,ep121,You have your jet soak tub.
266,ep121,Yeah. your separate shower.
267,ep121,It's a nice size.
268,ep121,And you have a walk-in closet.
269,ep121,"It's not as big as I would hope for, but..."
270,ep121,Okay. be doable.
271,ep121,This is gonna be your water room.
272,ep121,[all laughing]
273,ep121,"No! expected that she was not gonna be completely in love with the inside because she is a girl who loves her sparkle, okay?"
274,ep121,What I need Shaunda to understand is that it has great bones.
275,ep121,I just think this is so grand for your divaesque personality.
276,ep121,-Hi. people.
277,ep121,"So, we have a room here."
278,ep121,"This could be grandpa's bedroom, right?"
279,ep121,"Yeah. now, I am in the desert."
280,ep121,All of these bathrooms have these horrible wallpapers.
281,ep121,I'm just like ugh.
282,ep121,We can always replace it.
283,ep121,Xavier's gonna like this one.
284,ep121,"-Yes. like this, right?"
285,ep121,I give it three yeses.
286,ep121,It's not finished.
287,ep121,Okay. can be my little studio area or just a gaming area.
288,ep121,"It's fun for me to see Xavier's face just light up on different things, especially with the yard and the basement."
289,ep121,It's a lot of hard work just get to this point and just to see his face light up warm my heart.
290,ep121,"Overall, it is beautiful."
291,ep121,I do like the flooring.
292,ep121,I like the chandelier.
293,ep121,"I don't like that wallpaper, and also the countertops."
294,ep121,"It's just green, just ugh."
295,ep121,"And then, the lack of an island, it's just too much for me to take on, so I think I wanna see something else."
296,ep121,"So, her agent Leslie finds another new build with added bling, but it comes at an added cost."
297,ep121,-A few dollars or so.
298,ep121,-That ain't no few dollars.
299,ep121,Just a few dollars over.
300,ep121,It ain't a few dollars.
301,ep121,"Hmm. I see you rocking your red again, girl."
302,ep121,Red is that power color.
303,ep121,Mm-hmm. need all the power that I can get.
304,ep121,"Today, Leslie's taking them to see a new build in the suburb Lithonia in hopes of finally finding the wow factor Shaunda expects."
305,ep121,But it would require her to go over her limit.
306,ep121,"This one's gonna be a $330,000."
307,ep121,"-Just a little bit over, -a few dollars or so."
308,ep121,-That ain't no few dollars.
309,ep121,Just a few dollars over.
310,ep121,It ain't a few dollars.
311,ep121,Hmm. just a lit bit over.
312,ep121,-Okay. it does have laminate flooring throughout the main level so you don't have to worry about the carpet.
313,ep121,Okay. am liking this community.
314,ep121,"It looks very, very nice."
315,ep121,This is literally the last lot...
316,ep121,-available in this community.
317,ep121,-Really? a little bit.
318,ep121,The driveway doesn't look as long.
319,ep121,"With the new construction, we're not seeing as a long a driveway."
320,ep121,-Mm-hmm. there's ample street parking for your guests.
321,ep121,"Today, I'm showing Shaunda a home listed quite a bit above what she wants to pay."
322,ep121,"However, I wouldn't be doing my job as an agent if I didn't show everything that's available to her."
323,ep121,"I want her to see all of the beautiful things that are available in this new construction house to kind of take her mind off of that additional $30,000."
324,ep121,-I'm loving the brick accent.
325,ep121,Yes. the landscaping is really cute.
326,ep121,I like it.
327,ep121,That dirt is definitely an eye sore.
328,ep121,"Do you have, like, an ETA of when that's gonna be completed?"
329,ep121,It's going to be done in the next few months or so.
330,ep121,"$330,000... take a look inside."
331,ep121,...I be wowed.
332,ep121,Take a look and tell me what you think.
333,ep121,"Oh, this is nice."
334,ep121,-I like the floors.
335,ep121,Uh-huh. you have your living space and your kitchen.
336,ep121,"Wow. just one nice, long space."
337,ep121,I love this island.
338,ep121,It's so big that you could seat people around it.
339,ep121,And what about these cabinets here?
340,ep121,I like how it's coming together.
341,ep121,-It's making the kitchen pop.
342,ep121,Nice. doesn't catch my eye.
343,ep121,I don't like this.
344,ep121,"Okay, well..."
345,ep121,"I welcome your opinion, okay?"
346,ep121,-Thank you.
347,ep121,"-Mm-hmm. this one, you will need to purchase a refrigerator."
348,ep121,"So, what, that's like another $2,500 or so?"
349,ep121,"$2,000 to $4,000 just depending on your style."
350,ep121,"Hmm, so, for 330K, I was..."
351,ep121,Would have been nice if the refrigerator was included in the price.
352,ep121,Let's check out this patio.
353,ep121,-Okay. already liking this.
354,ep121,And look at this glass door.
355,ep121,Ooh! gives you all the light.
356,ep121,I like the size of this deck.
357,ep121,"Easily get some furniture on here, -your grill."
358,ep121,"Mm-hmm. we know you are the queen of entertainment, okay?"
359,ep121,Mm-hmm. up with this slope?
360,ep121,That is a little concerning to me.
361,ep121,"With this small yard, you know, I'll have to get, like, a little small dog, instead of a Doberman that you want."
362,ep121,No! have plenty of community space where you can walk your dog.
363,ep121,I'm on your side.
364,ep121,-Okay. right?
365,ep121,[Shaunda and Leslie laugh]
366,ep121,The space of this home is definitely a big plus for me and Xavier.
367,ep121,There's definitely room for growth.
368,ep121,"But I have this constant battle between my brain and my heart, like, ""This costs, X amount of dollars."
369,ep121,"Are you prepared to pay this X amount of dollars per month?"""
370,ep121,"So, that is like my struggle right now."
371,ep121,"Now, Xavier, I think I have just the thing..."
372,ep121,"that's gonna get you a little more excited, okay?"
373,ep121,Let's take a look at what could be your bedroom.
374,ep121,I like that ceiling.
375,ep121,Vaulted ceilings always make a space feel that much more spacious.
376,ep121,What are you thinking?
377,ep121,That kinda put you in a better mood?
378,ep121,"Yeah, all right."
379,ep121,He's just a tough cookie today.
380,ep121,-Tough cookie.
381,ep121,-[Shaunda laughs]
382,ep121,"Here we go, for our queen."
383,ep121,This beautiful main suite.
384,ep121,"Okay, I like the choice ceiling."
385,ep121,"-Oh, let me see this bathroom here."
386,ep121,Isn't this nice?
387,ep121,"Ooh, I love it."
388,ep121,"-Yes! is gorgeous, And look at this shower, -with the separate tub."
389,ep121,"Oh, yes."
390,ep121,I like the tile.
391,ep121,"I don't think I would want to have a window in the water room, but..."
392,ep121,At least the toilets have never been used.
393,ep121,-The toilet has never been used...
394,ep121,...and can frost the window.
395,ep121,And check out that closet.
396,ep121,Very spacious.
397,ep121,I see it has a little nook over here.
398,ep121,"I can put something up here, just specifically for my wigs."
399,ep121,This is an amazing closet and you can definitely get that chandelier that you've been thinking about.
400,ep121,"I don't know, girl."
401,ep121,"I mean, for $30,000 extra, I don't know."
402,ep121,I may just have to cut back on how many wigs I buy.
403,ep121,[Leslie chuckles]
404,ep121,"My heart is leading me to the bathroom, those granite countertops, the tall showers and the kitchen."
405,ep121,But I am still thinking about that 330K.
406,ep121,"With this particular home, not only are we dealing with the market, we're dealing with the fact that this is the last lot in this neighborhood, okay?"
407,ep121,"Pressure, pressure, pressure."
408,ep121,-No pressure.
409,ep121,"-Pressure, -No pressure."
410,ep121,"-It's pressure, girl."
411,ep121,[both chuckle]
412,ep121,"So, you know I've got your back."
413,ep121,"-I know you do, girl."
414,ep121,Single mom Shaunda's been saving up to finally afford a home for herself and her son.
415,ep121,But she needs to decide if it's worth spending just a little more to meet her lavish tastes.
416,ep121,How are you feeling about the new construction out in Conyers?
417,ep121,I do like the price of that.
418,ep121,"Also, they have a pool out there, so that's a big plus for Xavier."
419,ep121,And I also like the backyard space.
420,ep121,"I like the kitchen and the island, I also love the closet."
421,ep121,"But I would have loved to see more of a modern flooring, at least on the first floor."
422,ep121,What were you thinking about the resale out in Conyers?
423,ep121,That was the biggest one out of all the homes we saw.
424,ep121,"I like the brick accent of it, I love the long driveway, I also like the price of that as well."
425,ep121,"Xavier loved the yard, it would be perfect for a dog."
426,ep121,It does have a lot of space.
427,ep121,"However, inside, it was a little bit dated for me."
428,ep121,I did not like that wall paper.
429,ep121,"And I will have to do something with the countertop, in order to get it up to my taste to how I like it."
430,ep121,"All right, so, Xavier wasn't giving me much on this one, but I want to know, honestly, what are you thinking?"
431,ep121,This is a gorgeous house.
432,ep121,"The neighborhood seems really, really quiet."
433,ep121,"And I do like the flooring, it is really nice."
434,ep121,"And that kitchen, oh, my gosh."
435,ep121,-That is amazing.
436,ep121,Yes. backyard just seems to be a little bit small.
437,ep121,What I'm concerned about is just the price tag of it.
438,ep121,"Being a single mom, you know, I'm just, you know, counting my pennies, just making sure, you know, I'm not spending too much."
439,ep121,And that's totally understandable.
440,ep121,"But over a 30 year loan, it's not that big of a difference."
441,ep121,Maybe a few $100 a month.
442,ep121,I don't want you to miss out on any of these homes.
443,ep121,"So, you're gonna have to make a decision."
444,ep121,[Shaunda sighs]
445,ep121,[doorbell rings]
446,ep121,You were such a little baby.
447,ep121,-You were so tiny.
448,ep121,-I know.
449,ep121,I bought the new home in Conyers.
450,ep121,This home is just so beautiful.
451,ep121,"Also, the sub-division is very family-oriented."
452,ep121,"I mean, there's a club house and a pool."
453,ep121,"So, it just resonated with me and Xavier."
454,ep121,[doorbell rings]
455,ep121,That's grandad.
456,ep121,Go let him in.
457,ep121,I feel really lucky that I had Leslie during this whole process.
458,ep121,She was my advocate for me.
459,ep121,"I was able to get it for 280K, which is amazing."
460,ep121,Especially in this market with the houses flying off the shelves.
461,ep121,"With that extra, what, 20K, I can do my floors."
462,ep121,-Hey! you doing?
463,ep121,I like this house ceiling.
464,ep121,This is wonderful.
465,ep121,"Wow, look at that kitchen."
466,ep121,"One of my favorite things is the kitchen, and I love my closet."
467,ep121,I want to put in a customized clothing rack.
468,ep121,"And I also want to put it in, like, a little bench right up by the window."
469,ep121,My favorite part about this place is the basement.
470,ep121,Everything is all framed in.
471,ep121,"So, that's perfect."
472,ep121,I like that.
473,ep121,I had to make a few compromises with the flooring.
474,ep121,"Later on down the road, I can get the carpet up."
475,ep121,I also compromised on the size of the driveway.
476,ep121,"I just feel like if my friends come over, they will still have somewhere to park."
477,ep121,This is great.
478,ep121,"Yeah, I'm still hoping for the Doberman."
479,ep121,I won't stop trying until it's here.
480,ep121,It means so much to me for me to be able to able to buy a home just being a single mom.
481,ep121,"Sometimes, I'm just speechless because it's like I did it."
482,ep121,Everybody is so proud of me.
483,ep121,And I'm just so excited to have my little munchkin here with me.
484,ep121,Thank you.
485,ep121,-Thank you.
1,ep122,"Oh, my goodness."
2,ep122,Look at this place.
3,ep122,"With their first child about to arrive, Kristen's pushing to spend more to land a fully upgraded home close to DC."
4,ep122,But husband Jared isn't on board.
5,ep122,"Come on, babe."
6,ep122,The price.
7,ep122,He's trying to steer her out to the burbs to get a larger home for less.
8,ep122,I'm loving the neighborhood.
9,ep122,I'm loving the house.
10,ep122,But a dated fixer isn't on her radar.
11,ep122,-This place feels super '80s.
12,ep122,I agree.
13,ep122,But think about this.
14,ep122,"Fresh coat of white paint, hardwoods on this floor."
15,ep122,I feel like it should just stay in the '80s and let somebody else be the ones to do the fixing up.
16,ep122,Will she get the luxury she wants?
17,ep122,Look at this white pristine kitchen.
18,ep122,"We're looking at least a $3,000 mortgage."
19,ep122,I'm personally fine with it.
20,ep122,[theme music playing]
21,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
22,ep122,I'm getting hungry and I'm ready to eat.
23,ep122,I'm a legal project management analyst.
24,ep122,I am a senior business consultant for a software company.
25,ep122,We met at an NBA basketball game.
26,ep122,"He was just super, super nice and very attractive."
27,ep122,She had a sense of style and just energy about her.
28,ep122,You could see how she interacted with all our friends.
29,ep122,And I just had to woo her from then.
30,ep122,And it worked.
31,ep122,Thinking about making some pancakes.
32,ep122,"So we've actually been together now for four years, and we'll be celebrating our one year wedding anniversary very soon."
33,ep122,"And before we make it to that one year anniversary, we will be welcoming a baby boy."
34,ep122,Who's name is gonna be Jalen.
35,ep122,Jalen. I'm actually thinking about hiring a designer -to do the nursery 'cause...
36,ep122,-Excuse me?
37,ep122,Yeah. I think a designer will have like a professional eye for things and textures -and patterns that...
38,ep122,-I just think...
39,ep122,I just feel that's a little extra and over-the-top for a baby.
40,ep122,I would describe Jared as being someone who is very practical.
41,ep122,I think he definitely is way more frugal -that I am.
42,ep122,Sure. we're saving a lot more money for our family.
43,ep122,"Babe, you know where the pans are?"
44,ep122,"Uh, yeah."
45,ep122,You're standing right by there.
46,ep122,Under the stove.
47,ep122,"So for the last few days, we've been house sitting my parent's house."
48,ep122,"Babe, I don't see it."
49,ep122,"We're currently living in Arlington, Virginia in a one-bedroom rental apartment."
50,ep122,"And, really, we are looking for a home because we need space."
51,ep122,I was kind of hoping our time out here has kind of revitalized your love for suburban living.
52,ep122,Not exactly.
53,ep122,Just because like we're gonna become our parents.
54,ep122,I grew up in a single family home in the suburbs.
55,ep122,"However, I've gotten more comfortable with the city lifestyle."
56,ep122,"And because I still have to commute to DC, I do not want to go live in the suburbs."
57,ep122,"I understand that, but my parents are close."
58,ep122,We have built-in babysitters.
59,ep122,"Ideally, I would like to have a traditional single family home, just like the one I grew up in, my parent's house."
60,ep122,We're a young family.
61,ep122,We only have one child.
62,ep122,And I think we can definitely get away with living in a town house.
63,ep122,"Our apartment, there is a pool."
64,ep122,There is a gym.
65,ep122,And I wanna have access to the same amenities that I'm accustomed to.
66,ep122,"The townhouse-style of home, to me, we're still gonna have neighbors on top of us."
67,ep122,We're not gonna be given a space to play.
68,ep122,"A big backyard, to me, represents a lot of my childhood."
69,ep122,The memories of sledding down the hills in the backyard.
70,ep122,I wanna be able to replicate those times with our family as we grow up.
71,ep122,"Down the line as we get older and as our family expands, we can think about potentially having that traditional single family that you're so fond of."
72,ep122,But I think we could definitely do well in a townhome to start.
73,ep122,Townhomes nowadays have like open concept living.
74,ep122,I want the walls to be white.
75,ep122,I want modern and move-in ready.
76,ep122,I also definitely want an island because it's like the center of the kitchen.
77,ep122,"I am comfortable at $500,000."
78,ep122,"I'm more comfortable spending $600,000 on a house, because I think that's what we need to spend in order to get everything that we want."
79,ep122,I feel Jalen kicking me.
80,ep122,We are feeling major pressure.
81,ep122,This baby is coming.
82,ep122,We have to find a place as soon as possible.
83,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
84,ep122,"First stop, a condo in desirable Arlington, exactly where Kristen wants to be."
85,ep122,But selling Jared on the size and cost won't be easy.
86,ep122,Why are we seeing this two-bedroom house again?
87,ep122,You can't beat the location.
88,ep122,"But this location is still 40 minutes away from my parents, so we're not gonna have that help."
89,ep122,"Come on, babe."
90,ep122,The price for a two-bedroom.
91,ep122,"I do love this location, but we're starting a new chapter in our life, and it's time to move a little farther out in the suburbs, I think, where we can get a value for our home."
92,ep122,"-Hey, guys."
93,ep122,"Oh, hey, Lauren."
94,ep122,"-Hi, Lauren."
95,ep122,-Hi. how do you like it?
96,ep122,I heard you guys talking.
97,ep122,I love this place.
98,ep122,It feels traditional.
99,ep122,"It does feel traditional, but there is too many homes feeling traditional all at one time."
100,ep122,"Like, I don't know if I could do this, Lauren."
101,ep122,And I heard $389 for the condo fee?
102,ep122,Yes. comes with a lot though.
103,ep122,"Six pools within this community, -tennis courts..."
104,ep122,Wow. bike paths...
105,ep122,You hear that?
106,ep122,"...tot brought Kristen and Jared to this particular property really for Kristen, but I really wanna discover what Jared's willing to compromise on."
107,ep122,The upper level is renovated.
108,ep122,The lower level is practically not renovated.
109,ep122,But I really feel that this house has so much potential.
110,ep122,"Oh, my goodness."
111,ep122,Okay. floors.
112,ep122,Look at this place.
113,ep122,"It's super bright and airy in here, and really modern."
114,ep122,I love these floors.
115,ep122,What kind of floors are these?
116,ep122,These are gonna be laminate.
117,ep122,They're perfect for the dog and for the baby.
118,ep122,"First impression, it's a little tight in here."
119,ep122,I see a lot of potential.
120,ep122,This would be great like family room.
121,ep122,I don't know.
122,ep122,"I don't think it has the room that we're thinking we need, babe, for our family."
123,ep122,It seems like you're willing to sacrifice a lot -just to be closer to DC.
124,ep122,I am.
125,ep122,"I will say that the space is tight, but the location is prime real estate, and that is a huge selling point for me."
126,ep122,"-Oh, my goodness."
127,ep122,-Yes. knew you're gonna love it.
128,ep122,Here's my white kitchen.
129,ep122,Where is your island?
130,ep122,"Okay. think about if this wall was gone and then we maybe relocated the fridge, then you would space for an island if you wanted."
131,ep122,That does not sound like minor work.
132,ep122,It's not minor.
133,ep122,"And we are at the top at $499,000, so that not really something I'm willing to do."
134,ep122,We're at the top for you.
135,ep122,I'm willing to spend a lot more.
136,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
137,ep122,"Oh, this is..."
138,ep122,Okay. very quiet back here.
139,ep122,-Is that our backyard?
140,ep122,Yes. is...
141,ep122,Just ours?
142,ep122,That is all yours.
143,ep122,I do think it's a little tight.
144,ep122,What happens when Jalen grows up and he needs to run?
145,ep122,You guys can go play outside over there in that grass area.
146,ep122,I don't think I can live with the outside area.
147,ep122,There is not room for me and Jalen to play.
148,ep122,I just can't do it.
149,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
150,ep122,Okay. two bedrooms with that.
151,ep122,Mmm-hmm. like this room.
152,ep122,It's s decent-sized bedroom.
153,ep122,This space is at this point a flex space.
154,ep122,It's like a basement.
155,ep122,Yes. where's the primary?
156,ep122,I'm sorry.
157,ep122,Primary is gonna be around the corner.
158,ep122,But this could also serve as another space for you to come relax and unwind when you need to get time away from me and the baby.
159,ep122,I mean...
160,ep122,But you guys would be right there.
161,ep122,That's where the primary is.
162,ep122,I'm not getting away from anybody in this little house.
163,ep122,We're such a small family.
164,ep122,I think it will be fine for us in this moment.
165,ep122,It does have the standing shower that I wanted.
166,ep122,The phone booth standing shower?
167,ep122,The phone booth standing shower.
168,ep122,And you do have a tub upstairs.
169,ep122,You come out...
170,ep122,Yes. come out dressed as Wonder Woman?
171,ep122,I don't know.
172,ep122,This is...
173,ep122,This is...
174,ep122,"This is too, too tight for me."
175,ep122,This is nice.
176,ep122,Yeah. big.
177,ep122,It feels just so tight with the low ceiling.
178,ep122,"What if this whole wall was gone, okay?"
179,ep122,And then this just became a complete primary downstairs.
180,ep122,It's a lot of work but this...
181,ep122,"-We already at $499,900."
182,ep122,-Yeah. you have to consider that this is not the home we are going live in forever.
183,ep122,"This is just a place for us to start our family, and then we can move out of here and then potentially rent the property."
184,ep122,Thank you.
185,ep122,Yes. always moving.
186,ep122,I know.
187,ep122,But think about what this could do for your portfolio.
188,ep122,The investment opportunity in this particular property is really high.
189,ep122,You're never gonna depreciate.
190,ep122,This is always gonna be a hub for young people that wanna be close to the city.
191,ep122,So this is a very good buy.
192,ep122,Still 40 minutes away from my parents.
193,ep122,"That's true, but it's convenient for me."
194,ep122,Jared's gonna have to understand that his parents might not be our only babysitter.
195,ep122,I don't know.
196,ep122,I just don't see the value.
197,ep122,I definitely...
198,ep122,We need to see a single family.
199,ep122,"So their agent's lined up a single family home Jared wants, but the location might be an issue for Kristen."
200,ep122,It's so far away from DC.
201,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
202,ep122,I'm just super stressed out.
203,ep122,I haven't had time to even like do Lamaze classes.
204,ep122,"Adding to the stress, Kristen and Jared want to buy before the baby arrives, but she wants the convenience and action of the city while he's ready to settle down in the burbs."
205,ep122,It's so far away from DC.
206,ep122,"I understand the location isn't ideal, but the price is $479,900."
207,ep122,I think it's worth taking a shot.
208,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
209,ep122,Hello. Lauren.
210,ep122,Thank you for meeting me.
211,ep122,How do you guys like the neighborhood?
212,ep122,I'm loving the neighborhood.
213,ep122,I'm loving the house.
214,ep122,Nice traditional.
215,ep122,"It's a nice home, but it just makes me feel like we're too old to be living out here."
216,ep122,-Oh. are getting old.
217,ep122,"-Yeah, but we're not old."
218,ep122,Mmm-hmm. I love it.
219,ep122,The house that I'm showing them today is definitely for Jared.
220,ep122,But you just don't know.
221,ep122,"I figured that if Kristen came in here, she might like it."
222,ep122,-And the price is phenomenal.
223,ep122,Okay. right.
224,ep122,Decent sized foyer.
225,ep122,Yeah. we already...
226,ep122,We do have real hardwood floors.
227,ep122,I do like that.
228,ep122,Yeah. we have a nice sitting room over here.
229,ep122,It actually could be pretty much anything you wanted.
230,ep122,So what would we do with this room?
231,ep122,Maybe this could be my office or...
232,ep122,No. would be the sitting room.
233,ep122,"Like, you know, the room that no one touches."
234,ep122,That you just kind of looks pretty.
235,ep122,Classic staging and furniture.
236,ep122,-You got it.
237,ep122,You got it.
238,ep122,Yeah. can have one of those.
239,ep122,Kitchen's not bad.
240,ep122,Kitchen's pretty updated.
241,ep122,A few positives.
242,ep122,We have white cabinetry.
243,ep122,We have stainless steel appliances.
244,ep122,Did you notice the ceiling?
245,ep122,This adds quite a bit of character.
246,ep122,I think it's a pretty dated -feeling actually.
247,ep122,I love this house.
248,ep122,It had a somewhat updated kitchen.
249,ep122,And the price is great.
250,ep122,And we can put all of the updates that she likes.
251,ep122,It does lead us into a really nice great room.
252,ep122,Okay. have a fireplace.
253,ep122,Okay. okay.
254,ep122,-I do like the fireplace.
255,ep122,Nice. this is almost...
256,ep122,"Although, I don't like this exposed brick here."
257,ep122,I would definitely need to paint this.
258,ep122,I think we dress it up with the TV.
259,ep122,-This place feels super '80s.
260,ep122,I agree.
261,ep122,"But think about this, easy fixes, fresh coat of white paint, hardwoods on this floor, and then it would feel like new construction if you think about it."
262,ep122,"I feel like it should just stay in the '80s and let somebody else be the ones to do the fixing up on this house, 'cause that's not what I'm trying to do."
263,ep122,That's not my goal.
264,ep122,"-You know, I do like this."
265,ep122,-Right? screened porch.
266,ep122,"Well, let's go see this backyard you've been wanting so badly."
267,ep122,A little '70s tapestry.
268,ep122,I don't like how it has this like funky hill.
269,ep122,The topography of this lot is very sloped.
270,ep122,"But if you did steps up, there is a flat surface, so space to play with Jalen."
271,ep122,-See? sees it.
272,ep122,"I think the fence in the yard, we could work with with a configuration."
273,ep122,"It's a bit awkward, but it brought me back to all the warm and fuzzy thoughts I have from my childhood."
274,ep122,I think she nailed it.
275,ep122,This is the primary bedroom?
276,ep122,Yup. entry.
277,ep122,You've got two doors.
278,ep122,Very big and open.
279,ep122,Yeah. love that entry.
280,ep122,But I really can't get past this carpet.
281,ep122,You can install hardwood and make it all the same color.
282,ep122,Really modern and elevated.
283,ep122,So then we do have a bathroom connected into the suite.
284,ep122,This is...
285,ep122,This is pretty nice.
286,ep122,I don't like the vanity.
287,ep122,And this tub-shower combination.
288,ep122,"At least, it's a combination."
289,ep122,But I wanted a separate shower and tub.
290,ep122,Oh. do feel that this house had all of Kristen's wants.
291,ep122,"I understand there may be a hang-up on the location, but other than that, plenty of space, it got all the rooms we want."
292,ep122,That's huge for us going forward.
293,ep122,This could be a nice child room.
294,ep122,Can't you see the children growing up in a house like this?
295,ep122,"This house is way, way out."
296,ep122,Far away from civilization as far as I'm concerned.
297,ep122,"Oh, come on."
298,ep122,Jared and I both have two different visions of what we think is a family home.
299,ep122,"I think that the family makes the home, not the home itself."
300,ep122,So I think that wherever we settle down is that's what we make it.
301,ep122,Okay. of space down here.
302,ep122,"Yes. I mean, I just still see a lot of projects down here."
303,ep122,Oh. you know what?
304,ep122,This will be more like up your alley in my opinion.
305,ep122,The amenities in this neighborhood are phenomenal.
306,ep122,"So the HOA, it's $133 a month."
307,ep122,You have a golf course.
308,ep122,You have pools.
309,ep122,You have marina access.
310,ep122,"-Oh, wow."
311,ep122,-You even have horse stables.
312,ep122,"So if you guys ever wanted to get a horse, you can put your horse there."
313,ep122,-Wow. a lot.
314,ep122,-Wow. impressive.
315,ep122,Yeah. definitely was surprised at the amount of amenities that come with this house.
316,ep122,"Definitely stables for horses, that was the furthest thing from my mind."
317,ep122,So definitely shocking.
318,ep122,I like some of the features that the house has and I like the number of bedrooms.
319,ep122,"My biggest issue, honestly, is just location."
320,ep122,The house though was gorgeous.
321,ep122,The house just takes a little bit of updating to make it a little bit more modern.
322,ep122,And I think we have a place that we can live for 10 to 15 years.
323,ep122,So I think we need to consider it.
324,ep122,So the next place has a little more of what they both want.
325,ep122,A suburb and a little closer to the city with the modern finishes she wants.
326,ep122,But of course...
327,ep122,"It's $575,000 and honestly much too expensive."
328,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
329,ep122,Third trimester's definitely hitting a little different than the others.
330,ep122,"With time running out, Kristen and Jared really have to decide on a home."
331,ep122,"They're out in the suburbs again, but this house is a little closer to Washington DC."
332,ep122,"Plus, it's brand-new construction."
333,ep122,Perfect for Kristen.
334,ep122,"It's $575,000."
335,ep122,"And, honestly, much too expensive, even though I did talk to my parents this morning and they're pretty pumped that we're looking at somewhere kind of closer to where they live."
336,ep122,"Oh, I'm sure they are."
337,ep122,"I mean, it's way farther from DC than I would like."
338,ep122,It looked modern from the listing.
339,ep122,That's the part that I like.
340,ep122,And obviously it's a townhome.
341,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
342,ep122,This is so cute.
343,ep122,I like this.
344,ep122,I think we might have a view of the Potomac River over there.
345,ep122,We also have a view about 10 to 15 neighbors.
346,ep122,The houses are on top of each other here.
347,ep122,"I mean, we can..."
348,ep122,we can deal with that.
349,ep122,They have very different ideas of what they want in a house.
350,ep122,"So it has been a little challenging, but I feel like this was a good compromise for them both."
351,ep122,It's a beautiful interior.
352,ep122,It's elevated.
353,ep122,It's in a phenomenal neighborhood and a great location.
354,ep122,"-Oh, wow."
355,ep122,-Okay. entrance is much more grand than you would have think from the outside.
356,ep122,-I kind of like it.
357,ep122,Yeah. is perfect.
358,ep122,I love this.
359,ep122,Okay. then let's make our way around this corner.
360,ep122,There's a really great guest bedroom.
361,ep122,I love this room.
362,ep122,And I love how it's like really open air.
363,ep122,Lots of windows.
364,ep122,Lots of windows.
365,ep122,Backs up to our neighbors.
366,ep122,"Yes, it does."
367,ep122,This is nice.
368,ep122,We were driving in.
369,ep122,Mmm-hmm. did see a gold course.
370,ep122,So there is a gold course within this community.
371,ep122,You're gonna get a pool.
372,ep122,"You're gonna get a gym, hiking trails, tot lots."
373,ep122,"But also within the next few years, there's gonna restaurants and shops too."
374,ep122,See? speaking my language.
375,ep122,These are exactly the amenities that I want.
376,ep122,You get so much for your money.
377,ep122,"Out in the suburbs, you're gonna get more space, more square footage, because closer to DC, you really just..."
378,ep122,You don't get much property.
379,ep122,"Oh, my goodness."
380,ep122,Look at this white pristine kitchen.
381,ep122,-Wow. white.
382,ep122,Prep space for days.
383,ep122,Natural light.
384,ep122,This is everything that I wanted.
385,ep122,This is amazing.
386,ep122,It is beautiful.
387,ep122,It's beautiful.
388,ep122,"My only concern is it's $575,000."
389,ep122,"I don't know why she thinks that we can afford a house anywhere remotely close to $600,000."
390,ep122,"Kristen is a dreamer, and she thinks that whatever she wants, that she can get and I will give it to her."
391,ep122,She has been able to do that most of her life.
392,ep122,But sometimes I think it's my position to keep us in check and make sure we don't set us up for trouble in the future.
393,ep122,This outdoor area is a little tight.
394,ep122,"It's not this sprawling out, you know, backyard that I'm envisioning, you know?"
395,ep122,-Yes. know.
396,ep122,-This is...
397,ep122,It's more like small get-togethers that we're gonna be having here.
398,ep122,I don't know why he keeps talking about a backyard when this community has all the amenities that we could possibly want.
399,ep122,"We could go to the park, but maybe I want our own private space."
400,ep122,Maybe I'm practicing with him.
401,ep122,"And maybe I just wanna, you know, have our own private moments together with me and my son."
402,ep122,Okay. is nice and open.
403,ep122,"You know, this is more of a feel that I..."
404,ep122,"You know, I would think I'd be getting -in a single family home."
405,ep122,See? to come around a little bit.
406,ep122,Yes. I guess this one's the primary.
407,ep122,"Yes, it is."
408,ep122,Gorgeous tray ceiling.
409,ep122,Look at the size of this room.
410,ep122,Wow. is so much bigger than our apartment.
411,ep122,"Oh, wow."
412,ep122,This shower gets me every time.
413,ep122,Woo! shower is incredible.
414,ep122,Look at all the space.
415,ep122,Don't put your feet on it.
416,ep122,"-Oh, that's okay."
417,ep122,And the bench.
418,ep122,It's pretty relaxing.
419,ep122,Nice little sitting area.
420,ep122,I gotta say I was very surprised about what we could get out of a townhouse.
421,ep122,It's amazing.
422,ep122,It's immaculate.
423,ep122,But is it worth it?
424,ep122,No. at this time in our lives.
425,ep122,I absolutely love it.
426,ep122,The only issue for me is just the location.
427,ep122,It's just so far from the city.
428,ep122,I am definitely taken aback by the lack of the yard space and personal space and kind of having everybody on top of us.
429,ep122,The way you talk about the neighborhood does kind of make me feel better.
430,ep122,"-Yes. it's $575,000."
431,ep122,"Plus, on top of that, there's a $180 HOA fee."
432,ep122,"So we're looking, at least, a $3,000 mortgage."
433,ep122,We talk about this all the time.
434,ep122,Why do you think we can make this work?
435,ep122,We talk about it all the time and we know that we can definitely move some things around.
436,ep122,"Yes, we're gonna have to make some sacrifices but I'm personally fine with it."
437,ep122,We'll have to make some decisions.
438,ep122,"We're down to serious crunch time as far as Jalen's arrival, so we have no choice."
439,ep122,We have to make a decision as soon as possible.
440,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
441,ep122,It's crunch time for Kristen and Jared.
442,ep122,"With a baby on the way, they have to decide on a home fast."
443,ep122,What do you think about the condo?
444,ep122,I love the location.
445,ep122,It's only a 17-minute commute for me.
446,ep122,"That means about a 45-minute commute for my parents, so I just can't deal with the location."
447,ep122,There's only two bedrooms.
448,ep122,That's not enough for us.
449,ep122,There's not enough yard.
450,ep122,And the HOA fee was $389.
451,ep122,"And let's be honest, Kristen, you really like that kitchen?"
452,ep122,"I'll be honest, the kitchen is small, but I think we could definitely reconfigure, and maybe make it work for us."
453,ep122,"Well, let's talk about the single family home, where we have to make less stuff work for us and stuff is already there for us."
454,ep122,"Yeah, the single family home was pretty dated on the inside."
455,ep122,And there was too much carpet.
456,ep122,It was great.
457,ep122,We had a yard.
458,ep122,I feel like I'd be driving forever just trying to get from point A to point B.
459,ep122,"I understand you don't like the location, but I think we can make it work if we're willing just to sacrifice for a little bit."
460,ep122,I really like the new construction.
461,ep122,"For a townhome, it offers way more than I thought it would."
462,ep122,"But still, I think we're talking $575,000, -if I remember correctly."
463,ep122,"Yeah. was a little expensive for you, but it had all the amenities that I want."
464,ep122,"I mean, think about how amazing that kitchen was."
465,ep122,My only issue was the location.
466,ep122,I actually like the location.
467,ep122,"It's, you know, closer to my parents, but there is absolutely no yard, no space for Jalen and I to play."
468,ep122,"We're never gonna agree on this, babe."
469,ep122,"Like, we have to make a decision soon."
470,ep122,[upbeat music playing]
471,ep122,[doorbell dings]
472,ep122,"Hey. hey, hey, hey."
473,ep122,How you doing?
474,ep122,"So we end up going with the new build, of course."
475,ep122,The most expensive one with Kristen's immaculate kitchen.
476,ep122,It was definitely more of a compromise.
477,ep122,"I didn't get to stay close to DC like I really wanted, but ultimately we agreed that the townhome was for us because of the space."
478,ep122,"I do feel like we're stretching a little bit on the price, but the house is beautiful."
479,ep122,It feels great to have a new build that feels like a clean slate.
480,ep122,We really need to start thinking about what kind of stools we wanna get.
481,ep122,My favorite is definitely the white kitchen.
482,ep122,"Surprise, surprise, right?"
483,ep122,My favorite as well is probably the...
484,ep122,This just open great room.
485,ep122,But a close second is I love being this close to my parents and they love the fact that we are this close.
486,ep122,I think he's getting used to these stairs.
487,ep122,-Yeah. had to compromise.
488,ep122,I don't get a yard.
489,ep122,I'm in a townhome.
490,ep122,"But, overall, there's so much..."
491,ep122,so much to offer here.
492,ep122,I guess this goes here.
493,ep122,"Oops. within a week, we can get our big stuff moved over from our apartment to here."
494,ep122,"We really, you know, have been in a time crunch with the baby coming, and it is a little bit of a stressor."
495,ep122,I think he like it.
496,ep122,-Oh. think he's a little scared.
497,ep122,"Whoa! learned that as long as we work together and have a plan that, ultimately, everything is gonna work out the way it's supposed to in the end, and it has."
498,ep122,"Your first personalized blanket, Jalen."
499,ep122,-I love it.
500,ep122,-Me too.
501,ep122,We haven't even had time to truly feel the excitement of all the things that are happening because they've just been kind of coming one after the other.
502,ep122,"But when we really stop and think about things, it's just..."
503,ep122,It's beautiful.
504,ep122,Everything's worked out great.
1,ep123,"Oh, wow!"
2,ep123,It's really big and really nice and open.
3,ep123,"Immediately, I love that."
4,ep123,"After a year of living and working in a one bedroom apartment, Jenny and Liam are desperate for more space."
5,ep123,"Bit since Southern California's so pricey, they're going to have turf battles."
6,ep123,Where's your office can be?
7,ep123,-My office is going to be right here.
8,ep123,-This is mine.
9,ep123,"They're at odds on just about everything else, too."
10,ep123,It's very...shoebox-y.
11,ep123,It's actually...
12,ep123,I kinda like it-- It's just so open.
13,ep123,I know you like that.
14,ep123,I like the openness.
15,ep123,Like a little mystery.
16,ep123,"Maybe like a wall here or something, you know?"
17,ep123,"-It's $949,000."
18,ep123,-What do we do?
19,ep123,You can get another job.
20,ep123,You can get another job.
21,ep123,"-Just looks like summer, year round."
22,ep123,-Yeah. write music for film.
23,ep123,Which means that I am home working a lot.
24,ep123,I'm a professor.
25,ep123,"And when I am not teaching, I also work from home a lot, doing research."
26,ep123,"We're not really sure how we met, but it's a mystery."
27,ep123,We connected on social media through a mutual friend.
28,ep123,"Who-- We don't really know the mutual friend, it was someone very random for both of us."
29,ep123,"I think it'd be nice to find something like this, similar."
30,ep123,"Currently, our living situation, we are in 750 sq."
31,ep123,"ft. lived there before Liam did, and he moved into the tiny, one bedroom apartment."
32,ep123,"Honestly, when I met Liam, I thought he might have been homeless."
33,ep123,Because he had most of his stuff in his car.
34,ep123,I was not living out of my car.
35,ep123,-This is falsehood.
36,ep123,"I was in between places, month to month."
37,ep123,-Then I moved in.
38,ep123,-Mm-hm. need a place for me to work.
39,ep123,And a place for you to work.
40,ep123,"Really, what we want is over 1,000 sq."
41,ep123,"ft. bedroom, extra bathroom..."
42,ep123,It just makes sense to think about buying instead of continually renting a space that was too small.
43,ep123,"We pretty much knew right away we wanted to be together, and get a bigger place, eventually."
44,ep123,"And we can actually start something, together."
45,ep123,"Outdoor space, Southern California."
46,ep123,-Southern California.
47,ep123,-Need to be outside.
48,ep123,"-Yeah, that's-- -Year round."
49,ep123,"Also, to have walking distance to a place like this, would be great."
50,ep123,"Coffee shops, and stores and thing like that."
51,ep123,That's a must.
52,ep123,We're living on a coast.
53,ep123,"Especially since I'm from the Midwest, and being landlocked..."
54,ep123,I wanna be near the ocean.
55,ep123,I am very much a beach baby.
56,ep123,"I love the sun, I love the sand."
57,ep123,"And for me, I like to run, as well."
58,ep123,It would be nice to be able to run to the beach.
59,ep123,And enjoy the scenery.
60,ep123,So we're looking at al the beach communities down the coast.
61,ep123,"Further down south, it is much more affordable for what we're looking for, with a little more space."
62,ep123,"-So, we have a 700."
63,ep123,"-700. it is so competitive now, we might have to bid over asking."
64,ep123,The market is incredibly difficult in California.
65,ep123,And I just paid off a lot of student loan debt.
66,ep123,"And going over what we really anticipate, we're gonna have to make a lot of cutbacks."
67,ep123,"$900,000, that's a cap."
68,ep123,And it has to be move-in ready at that price point.
69,ep123,"Let's see, what else?"
70,ep123,"Something traditional, colonial?"
71,ep123,"So, I'm obnoxious with my taste -'cause I grew up in the East Coast."
72,ep123,True. obnoxious.
73,ep123,"A craft smith, next to a federalist."
74,ep123,I grew up in a colonial house.
75,ep123,Definite separate rooms.
76,ep123,"Here, in California, it's all..."
77,ep123,Mid-century Modern.
78,ep123,Which is immensely boring.
79,ep123,-But I find something like that to be very charming...
80,ep123,-That was me.
81,ep123,...about location and region you're in.
82,ep123,"So, to have a mid-century modern house, or Spanish style, the bungalows, these beach houses that we see..."
83,ep123,"I would love to match the region that we're in, and embrace the style that California has to bring."
84,ep123,"Also, I think it's really important with an open floor plan, to have a little more space where we can add the items for the cats."
85,ep123,Which equals their cat trees.
86,ep123,"So, they need to have a space in front of a window."
87,ep123,"We have two cats, Rasputin and Elsie."
88,ep123,"Let's be honest, every room will be designed based around the cat tree."
89,ep123,"And where that goes, the rest of it will follow."
90,ep123,-Including me.
91,ep123,-Pretty-- That's pretty true.
92,ep123,"Today, since they're interested in looking at places down the coast, their agent Bill has decided to show them a house in Long Beach."
93,ep123,This corner's really nice.
94,ep123,There's... restaurants.
95,ep123,"Couple of coffee options, I like that."
96,ep123,Some shops.
97,ep123,And I think we're just a couple of blocks away.
98,ep123,-So we can walk down here.
99,ep123,Which is nice.
100,ep123,-Okay. still not close to the beach though.
101,ep123,The neighborhood here is Cal Heights.
102,ep123,One of the best neighborhoods in Long Beach.
103,ep123,It's a hidden secret.
104,ep123,"This house, in particular, is rather small."
105,ep123,But it makes it so that the-- Jenny and Liam can maybe save some money.
106,ep123,"-Hey, Bill."
107,ep123,"-Hey, guys."
108,ep123,It's really cute.
109,ep123,Definitely midcentury kinda feel.
110,ep123,Yeah. in 1948.
111,ep123,It's midcentury.
112,ep123,It's kinda dull and weird-looking from the outside.
113,ep123,"I want something that's, you know, East Coast and traditional, and this isn't it."
114,ep123,It's really nice and bright in here.
115,ep123,I like the windows.
116,ep123,"A nice spot, uh..."
117,ep123,"The window, for the cats."
118,ep123,They need some light and bright.
119,ep123,Someplace they can sunbathe.
120,ep123,She's already planning the cat trees.
121,ep123,-That's awesome.
122,ep123,That's awesome.
123,ep123,-Their placement.
124,ep123,This living room really is a little closed off from what I wanted.
125,ep123,"I really wanted some flowing energy and spaces into each room, rather than separated."
126,ep123,Open floor plan's no good.
127,ep123,Boring. like it.
128,ep123,This is more interesting because it has that separation.
129,ep123,"Nice, functional kitchen."
130,ep123,Looks like it has Corian countertops.
131,ep123,It'd be nice to have just a little more counter space.
132,ep123,"Appliances are dated, a bit."
133,ep123,I think this...
134,ep123,This is nice.
135,ep123,Built-in shelf.
136,ep123,"Maybe, at a time, had an ironing board, or something like that..."
137,ep123,-Interesting. a spice rack.
138,ep123,"Those are the features that are nice, when you can find them, It changes things up, keeps it interesting."
139,ep123,This is the main bathroom.
140,ep123,"Yeah, okay."
141,ep123,-Little bit outdated.
142,ep123,"I mean, it still..."
143,ep123,-It's very outdated.
144,ep123,"I think it would need, obviously, a coat of paint."
145,ep123,-Oh. to the green room.
146,ep123,[Jenny chuckles]
147,ep123,I like it.
148,ep123,I like the windows on both sides.
149,ep123,"You can see some sunlight getting in, even on a cloudier day."
150,ep123,-Feel like I'm inside of a giant salad.
151,ep123,Something that paint can easily fix.
152,ep123,This was the original garage.
153,ep123,This room is very big.
154,ep123,The step down aspect of it is kinda neat.
155,ep123,Having that different level.
156,ep123,Where's your office gonna be?
157,ep123,-My office is going to be right here.
158,ep123,-This is mine.
159,ep123,"But this room is big enough for-- I think we could split it off, somehow."
160,ep123,-Um... a really nice room.
161,ep123,It has these really tall ceilings.
162,ep123,-Which makes it feel bigger than what it is.
163,ep123,-Yeah. think there is a lot of potential.
164,ep123,"Yeah, so you got a nice laundry here."
165,ep123,Here's the laundry.
166,ep123,-Okay. then here's the bonus bathroom.
167,ep123,This leaves a little more to be desired.
168,ep123,"Wait, something's missing here."
169,ep123,I wouldn't call this a bathroom.
170,ep123,-It's like a bath-ette.
171,ep123,[both laugh]
172,ep123,A glorified train bathroom.
173,ep123,"Come on, check it all out."
174,ep123,"-Ooh, wow!"
175,ep123,"Yeah, it's a really fantastic space."
176,ep123,-This is nice.
177,ep123,"-Yeah. know, you gotta look for the outdoor living space, and because it's just equally as important as the inside space."
178,ep123,This house is on the small side.
179,ep123,But in Southern California we have great weather.
180,ep123,And it allows for the outdoor space to become part of your home.
181,ep123,My job is to make sure they understand that.
182,ep123,I like that it's enclosed.
183,ep123,"So you not only have the privacy, but we have room for..."
184,ep123,-We can let the cats out and they can roam.
185,ep123,Yeah. really the ultimate deciders on whatever house.
186,ep123,-They are.
187,ep123,"-And then, an eventual dog, maybe."
188,ep123,-Yeah. yeah.
189,ep123,-Yeah. of kids.
190,ep123,Triplets? A kid?
191,ep123,-A kid?
192,ep123,-A single?
193,ep123,[Jenny exclaims]
194,ep123,Like it's our own secret garden.
195,ep123,A mini outdoor oasis.
196,ep123,RIght. square footage in the side yard and the back yard -really makes it a beautiful home.
197,ep123,Yeah. you go.
198,ep123,"-Ooh, it works."
199,ep123,-That's kinda nice.
200,ep123,It's... isn't always my favorite.
201,ep123,I'd like it though.
202,ep123,"It gives it that classic charm, with a little bungalow vibe which I really like."
203,ep123,"But the ultimate living space is so very tiny for an upgrade, which is kinda what we're looking for."
204,ep123,"Yeah. now, Bill's found a three bedroom, also in Long Beach."
205,ep123,It's not near the beach.
206,ep123,But that extra space would be really nice.
207,ep123,-Yeah. that might be something we'll have to compromise on.
208,ep123,I'm not necessarily seeing a lot of walkability to restaurants or shops.
209,ep123,Jenny and Liam have high hopes for their first house in the hot LA market.
210,ep123,"Bigger than their current place, near the beach and in a walkable area."
211,ep123,"Today's place in Long Beach has the space, but not the location."
212,ep123,"Also, it's not near the beach."
213,ep123,But that extra space would be really nice.
214,ep123,-Yeah. that might be something we'll have to compromise on.
215,ep123,-The one in the middle?
216,ep123,The gray one?
217,ep123,-I think this is-- I think it's the gray one.
218,ep123,It's very...shoebox-y.
219,ep123,I kinda like it.
220,ep123,I like the door.
221,ep123,It's a little bit of a nice highlight there.
222,ep123,So very close to the neighbors though.
223,ep123,"Hey, Bill."
224,ep123,-How are ya?
225,ep123,Good. how are you?
226,ep123,Nice sunny yard here.
227,ep123,Needs a little love.
228,ep123,-I like it.
229,ep123,-Yeah. light coming in here.
230,ep123,It's painted really well.
231,ep123,"Yeah, it's obviously had a lot of work just recently done."
232,ep123,"I liked it that when you walk in, this is all you see right now."
233,ep123,It's not fully open.
234,ep123,So there's a little bit of a mystery.
235,ep123,"Like, what's around the corner?"
236,ep123,"I was actually just going to say, I would like to see something where you can see what's behind this wall."
237,ep123,He likes the idea that you cannot see anything past just the living room.
238,ep123,"I don't like that, I really want something open."
239,ep123,"And I want something that doesn't feel like a tuna can, where we're all just kinda smushed in together."
240,ep123,"Oh, wow!"
241,ep123,"So, I thought you would like this."
242,ep123,I'm sold.
243,ep123,Are these granite countertops?
244,ep123,"Uh, this is a quartz countertop."
245,ep123,-This is so pretty.
246,ep123,New appliances.
247,ep123,"I do feel, a little bit, like I need a science lab coat."
248,ep123,To do experiments.
249,ep123,But you know all your food would be clean.
250,ep123,Liam thinks the kitchen is very sterile.
251,ep123,"But he doesn't cook, so he doesn't understand what it is to have a nice counterspace, or a nice space that seems clean, and bright and airy to cook in."
252,ep123,So this is it for this floor.
253,ep123,Feels a little tight for hosting.
254,ep123,"If we have guests over, there's not a ton of space there."
255,ep123,Little bit.
256,ep123,There's no real dining space.
257,ep123,It's just a little kitchen table.
258,ep123,"It's hard because it's so separated, too."
259,ep123,One nice thing is that there is a guest bath off the kitchen.
260,ep123,"Good to have, This, sort of, looks colonial inspired."
261,ep123,Yeah. that looks familiar to me.
262,ep123,Something that looks like it wouldn't stay in the house.
263,ep123,-[all laughing]
264,ep123,Yeah. even some cat trees could go here.
265,ep123,The cat trees would need to go in front of a window somewhere.
266,ep123,"That's a little, uh, not happening."
267,ep123,"Ah, I do like the enclosed patio."
268,ep123,Especially for the cats.
269,ep123,Has their own little patio...
270,ep123,-...so can't escape.
271,ep123,I don't like-- It's just all concrete.
272,ep123,So I was hoping there would be some grassiness?
273,ep123,"Some grassy nook, like the front yard."
274,ep123,"There isn't a lot of privacy -that we have on these walls, from neighbors."
275,ep123,-Yeah. get eye shot to both neighbors.
276,ep123,Feel like you'll get watched all the time.
277,ep123,This is a really great-sized room.
278,ep123,And it has two closets.
279,ep123,Which is very nice.
280,ep123,It's nice and bright.
281,ep123,I like that.
282,ep123,I'm gonna take this as my office.
283,ep123,-Don't tell her.
284,ep123,-[Jenny chuckles]
285,ep123,This is the one bathroom for the upstairs.
286,ep123,I really love the tile.
287,ep123,"Similar to the kitchen, I love the cabinetry, it's nice."
288,ep123,"This is the kind of feature that makes it interesting, artistically, right?"
289,ep123,"-Mm-hm. Spanish style, and brings in some of the artistic touches that we're looking for."
290,ep123,It is a little bit smaller that the first bedroom that we saw.
291,ep123,This could be easily turned into an office.
292,ep123,Let's check out the main room.
293,ep123,"Oh, wow, it's big."
294,ep123,"I like this upstairs area just because it's a little bit, you know, cozy."
295,ep123,"I like the number of rooms, that's really nice."
296,ep123,So we can all have our separate spaces.
297,ep123,"We can have separate places for our offices, and there is not really a lot of work we would have to put into this house."
298,ep123,It is very beautiful.
299,ep123,That's-- The nice kitchen.
300,ep123,"It would be a little tight, maybe, down here, to host people."
301,ep123,We could do some things with the front yard.
302,ep123,Build this into a little bit of a outdoor space.
303,ep123,-Don't know about that back patio.
304,ep123,"Right. wise, there is not a lot of walkability."
305,ep123,"Since the neighborhoods they've seen so far aren't giving them the beach access and walkability they want, they've decided it's time to stretch themselves with this next place."
306,ep123,"It's $949,000."
307,ep123,"So we'll have to make some concessions, but..."
308,ep123,There's some benefits with this place.
309,ep123,It's near shopping.
310,ep123,A ton of shopping.
311,ep123,A ton of restaurants.
312,ep123,'Cause we'll have so much leftover money to spend on stuff.
313,ep123,"This is, for me, the ideal location."
314,ep123,"Like, this is the dream."
315,ep123,Orange County.
316,ep123,Newport Beach.
317,ep123,"After seeing two homes in Long Beach, that weren't in the perfect location, Liam and Jenny are heading farther south too see a town home near the beach."
318,ep123,"It's $949,000."
319,ep123,So we'll have to make some concessions.
320,ep123,But the location has everything we really want.
321,ep123,-That's true-- -It's near the beach.
322,ep123,"-Ocean view, look at that."
323,ep123,"-Yeah, we can see the ocean already."
324,ep123,It's near shopping.
325,ep123,A ton of shopping.
326,ep123,A ton of restaurants.
327,ep123,'Cause we'll have so much leftover money to spend on stuff.
328,ep123,What do we do?
329,ep123,You can get another job.
330,ep123,You can get another job.
331,ep123,It's more than they want to spend.
332,ep123,"But if they really want fit and finish like this, in this location, this is what it's going to cost."
333,ep123,"Hey, Bill, how are you?"
334,ep123,Good. stairs are a little wobbly.
335,ep123,"Ooh, wow!"
336,ep123,Hey-o. is nice.
337,ep123,It's really big and really nice and open.
338,ep123,"Immediately, I love that."
339,ep123,"This is perfect for entertaining, I can cook in the kitchen, we can have our guests here."
340,ep123,"Uh, this is amazing."
341,ep123,I feel like there is a favorite color that they had.
342,ep123,"-I can't put my finger on it, but..."
343,ep123,Yeah. a gray area.
344,ep123,-It's definitely a little gray.
345,ep123,Love the countertops.
346,ep123,New looking appliances.
347,ep123,And new cabinetry.
348,ep123,"If you can see, we're all in this kitchen -and you could still be cooking and entertaining."
349,ep123,Yeah. space here where I don't have to yell at Liam for being in my way.
350,ep123,That's right.
351,ep123,Really well thought out.
352,ep123,"You can just give me like a little gate here, and I'll stay in the bar corner..."
353,ep123,-What about the cats?
354,ep123,-Yeah. cats are welcome in my kitchen.
355,ep123,Liam is not.
356,ep123,There is a really nice outdoor patio.
357,ep123,Okay. that's nice and sunny and open and bright.
358,ep123,"I'd like that it's enclosed, so the cats have a nice place to kind of roam, but they don't-- It's not really enough for them to roam."
359,ep123,They can just kinda chill.
360,ep123,It's smaller than what we have now.
361,ep123,"I do worry about, at least in this area here, there's no room for the cat trees."
362,ep123,There's room.
363,ep123,We'll find it.
364,ep123,"Yeah, this is a really big space."
365,ep123,"I mean, this is large furnishing in here, it is much bigger than you think it is."
366,ep123,It's... but it's just so open.
367,ep123,-I know you like that.
368,ep123,-I like the openness.
369,ep123,I like a little mystery.
370,ep123,"Maybe like a wall here or something, you know."
371,ep123,This is a nice guest bathroom.
372,ep123,"This feels cozy, in a nice, nest-y kind of way."
373,ep123,Beautiful crown molding.
374,ep123,Really big closets here.
375,ep123,Two sinks for me.
376,ep123,"-Yeah, for all your primping."
377,ep123,-Each hand is gonna have a sink.
378,ep123,And this is another really large room.
379,ep123,"Look, you have two full beds in here."
380,ep123,And another full bathroom.
381,ep123,"The whole wall is mirrored closet, so it's not like you can actually put furniture up on this."
382,ep123,So it does limit some of that space for desk usage.
383,ep123,"Yeah, I mean, there is a possibility of converting part of the closet into -a workspace."
384,ep123,-Ooh. there's a nice balcony too.
385,ep123,"So nice when you have groceries, you're just bringing them in, right from the garage."
386,ep123,"Oh, it's big."
387,ep123,"Now, it is big enough to where if you wanted to do some extra living space in here, plus have parking, it'd definitely happen."
388,ep123,"Yeah, we can fit two cars and a work nook for you."
389,ep123,"And... bed and nook, and everything."
390,ep123,"She's got all the plans for me, I guess."
391,ep123,-There you go.
392,ep123,-I do.
393,ep123,"I truly do think that garage space would be ideal for music, because it is a little closed off from the rest of the house."
394,ep123,And it would give him some privacy.
395,ep123,"Um, where he can actually make noises and not worry about bugging me."
396,ep123,"It's good, I like it."
397,ep123,"It's certainly turnkey, it's ready to go."
398,ep123,Really nice materials.
399,ep123,It really has a lot of what we're looking for.
400,ep123,I love the openness down here.
401,ep123,"There is some price concern to take into consideration, but I wanted you guys to see what it was going to take to get a property with everything that you wanted."
402,ep123,"Proximity to shops, and everything else."
403,ep123,Access to the beach.
404,ep123,Really nice finishes.
405,ep123,Something that's move-in ready.
406,ep123,-This one has a pool.
407,ep123,That is nice.
408,ep123,-We have to talk about it.
409,ep123,"-Yeah, we'll have to talk about this."
410,ep123,That price is a little sketchy.
411,ep123,But I like it otherwise.
412,ep123,"I think, just getting out of debt and that student loan crunch..."
413,ep123,"You know, that could be a little less ideal, obviously."
414,ep123,When we're trying to start a life together.
415,ep123,"But if we crunch some numbers, or make some concessions, I think maybe we can make it work."
416,ep123,So what do you guys think?
417,ep123,We've seen a lot of houses.
418,ep123,Liam and Jenny want out of their small apartment.
419,ep123,"But in the hot Southern California market, they'll have to make some compromises, no matter which house they choose."
420,ep123,Let's take the midcentury house.
421,ep123,I really like that because it has a outdoor space.
422,ep123,It's really nice and private.
423,ep123,"There's some stores, restaurants, bars."
424,ep123,So that walkability is really there.
425,ep123,There is a lot of work that we would have to do on it.
426,ep123,And it would raise that price.
427,ep123,"While it sounds really great, we know it's not necessarily going to go for that."
428,ep123,Because everything is going so much above what the list is.
429,ep123,The two story traditional is pretty solid.
430,ep123,It has two offices.
431,ep123,"It doesn't feel like a nice, flowy house."
432,ep123,And even the backyard is not even a backyard.
433,ep123,"Well, at 1,400 sq."
434,ep123,ft though.
435,ep123,Pretty big house.
436,ep123,It was completely done.
437,ep123,"Yeah, we wouldn't have to really put any money into it at all."
438,ep123,But the walkability is something that we really wanted.
439,ep123,We wanted at least a coffee shop to walk to.
440,ep123,"Otherwise, Liam gets cranky in the mornings, and he's hard to deal with."
441,ep123,The town home is really nice.
442,ep123,It's walkable.
443,ep123,"There are restaurants, there are coffee shops."
444,ep123,There's shopping.
445,ep123,And it is within walking distance to the beach.
446,ep123,And that is something that...
447,ep123,"When I think of Southern California, I would really love."
448,ep123,The finishes are really nice.
449,ep123,Everything's updated.
450,ep123,It'd be ready to jump in and enjoy.
451,ep123,But that price is well above what we wanted to spend.
452,ep123,Though it'd be a lifestyle change.
453,ep123,And our concession would just really have to be enjoying the space that we're living in.
454,ep123,You guys ready to write an offer?
455,ep123,Make it happen?
456,ep123,[doorbell rings]
457,ep123,What are you guys doing in there?
458,ep123,Getting ready for the Olympics.
459,ep123,"We chose the midcentury modern house, thankfully."
460,ep123,I rescued it with some traditional furnishings inside.
461,ep123,We managed to get the whole house painted before we moved in.
462,ep123,"So, it no longer looks like a fruit bowl."
463,ep123,-You... take my head off with that.
464,ep123,We chose this house because it was the brightest and cheeriest of them.
465,ep123,It had the nicest floor plan.
466,ep123,It was the most interesting.
467,ep123,"And even though it's two bedrooms, the second bedroom is split really nicely with a large bookshelf."
468,ep123,"And it feel almost like a third space, for Liam's music."
469,ep123,"Can you feed the cat's first, please?"
470,ep123,Yes. you can feed 'em on the patio.
471,ep123,"While it is a little further away from the beach, we have some really great restaurants nearby, we have some grocery stores nearby."
472,ep123,"In the mornings, I love popping out the door, and going down to grab a coffee."
473,ep123,Couldn't do that in the last place.
474,ep123,It was just too secluded.
475,ep123,"Hi, guys, you hungry?"
476,ep123,Come on.
477,ep123,It's gonna be close.
478,ep123,And the winner is...
479,ep123,-[Liam laughing]
480,ep123,"It's a photo finish, Raspy."
481,ep123,Raspy. a house is a little scary.
482,ep123,"Just getting out of debt, and then adding a mortgage on..."
483,ep123,"However, I think, it is actually financially a good choice."
484,ep123,"Especially in California, where real estate is always pretty a hot market."
485,ep123,"So, it was listed at $599,000."
486,ep123,"And we paid $680,00."
487,ep123,"Bill really had to work with us, and he did really great, helping us outbid almost 30 offers."
488,ep123,-We tried to pay with bags of beans...
489,ep123,I think he is still getting used to this place.
490,ep123,Maybe he just needs his own chair.
491,ep123,Yeah. insists on formal dining.
492,ep123,-I think so.
493,ep123,Yep. all it took.
494,ep123,"Wow, how about that."
495,ep123,We also chose this house because the backyard is incredible.
496,ep123,We have a lot of outdoor living space.
497,ep123,"Because the square footage is so large on the lot, we can actually add, probably, a third bedroom which is really what we wanted, as we grow in our relationship."
498,ep123,It'll be really exciting to see what's next.
1,ep124,I you would love this because...
2,ep124,This is huge.
3,ep124,I know.
4,ep124,"Chad and William wants space in Nashville for themselves, a great aunt, and one other person."
5,ep124,This could be Portia's closet.
6,ep124,Portia is my alter ego.
7,ep124,I do shows every Saturday and Sunday.
8,ep124,But these two disagree on almost everything.
9,ep124,Chad is a little tight when he doesn't like to spend the money.
10,ep124,What is the price of this house again?
11,ep124,"It's $430,000."
12,ep124,"Now, William, he loves to spend the money."
13,ep124,I knew we were gonna go over.
14,ep124,But I mean look at the kitchen you get in here.
15,ep124,Y'all have to...
16,ep124,You're gonna have to give -and take on this.
17,ep124,Compromise. farm animals ain't stayin'.
18,ep124,-[donkey braying]
19,ep124,-[doorbell dings]
20,ep124,[theme music playing]
21,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
22,ep124,You handed me this little baby knife.
23,ep124,And you don't cut cheese with this little baby knife.
24,ep124,I am the director of technology for a property management company.
25,ep124,I'm a finance manager for an agricultural company.
26,ep124,"We have been together for six years, -married for four years."
27,ep124,"-Oh, my God."
28,ep124,-Just give it to me.
29,ep124,-No. got it.
30,ep124,"See? originally from Nashville, Tennessee."
31,ep124,I was born and raised here.
32,ep124,"I'm originally from Kingston, Georgia and I was raised on an eight-acre farm."
33,ep124,From the middle of nowhere Georgia is where he's from.
34,ep124,"Before we go outside, do you wanna show me what you're wearing tonight?"
35,ep124,"Oh, yeah."
36,ep124,Hold on a second.
37,ep124,We met online on a dating app.
38,ep124,He was very charming.
39,ep124,He was a little introverted.
40,ep124,We're just the opposites.
41,ep124,I'm more of a homebody.
42,ep124,I'd love to have people over.
43,ep124,Whereas Chad is just completely different.
44,ep124,I love to entertain people and make them laugh and just have a good time.
45,ep124,"Actually, I am a drag queen."
46,ep124,I can wear my jumpsuit that has Portia on the back.
47,ep124,Portia is my alter ego.
48,ep124,I do shows every Saturday and Sunday.
49,ep124,She just brings out the best in me.
50,ep124,-We need a bigger kitchen.
51,ep124,-Yeah. live here with my great aunt and our four dogs.
52,ep124,We wanted his aunt to move in with us from her living by herself.
53,ep124,So we purchased this home that we're in now.
54,ep124,"We originally bought this house, thinking it would work for our needs."
55,ep124,But it's not as big as we would like.
56,ep124,"My aunt, her room unfortunately is super small, you know, she deserves to have a nice size room and we don't have, like, a space that really is conducive to hosting or entertaining."
57,ep124,We really need something bigger.
58,ep124,But we're a little bit more picky in what we're looking for in a house and we're really not on the same page.
59,ep124,-Okay. are stubborn.
60,ep124,"We may lose a few of our features that we want, but..."
61,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
62,ep124,No. compromise.
63,ep124,Mostly because I'm right.
64,ep124,What are you trying to stay...
65,ep124,"Like, what do you not wanna go over?"
66,ep124,"I don't wanna go over $400,000."
67,ep124,"I'm frugal with my money just because I want to make sure that if we want to go do something, I like having some side money for that."
68,ep124,"But William, he's one of those that if dies tomorrow with $20 in his bank account, it's going to make him mad."
69,ep124,"He likes shiny things, such as a hot tub."
70,ep124,So went and we got it and then we sold it.
71,ep124,We sold it 'cause we were over it.
72,ep124,"No, not we."
73,ep124,It was a pain in the butt.
74,ep124,He never cleaned it.
75,ep124,-I did!
76,ep124,"I was cleaning it and I was sick of it, so I sold it."
77,ep124,You gotta get what you want.
78,ep124,"We can definitely go to $450,000 if it means finding the perfect house."
79,ep124,Boom. another thing is a yard.
80,ep124,I grew up on eight acres and I love the farm house vibe.
81,ep124,I would love some land and...
82,ep124,No. a city boy.
83,ep124,"So it's like my style is mid-century modern, like something that looks really sleek and clean."
84,ep124,I don't wanna do any work in the house.
85,ep124,I want something that's brand new.
86,ep124,Chad's done some upgrades to our upstairs bathroom.
87,ep124,I'm a handyman.
88,ep124,I'm all about smaller projects in a home making it your own.
89,ep124,All of that just stresses me out to the max.
90,ep124,I hate doing projects.
91,ep124,"-See, he's getting red now just thinking about it."
92,ep124,-Yeah. still gotta shave.
93,ep124,"-Yeah, I know."
94,ep124,And you still gotta get ready.
95,ep124,What I would love is to have a room for Portia.
96,ep124,You look fantastic.
97,ep124,-Thank you.
98,ep124,She has multiple boxes of fabric and numerous wigs.
99,ep124,And a lot of it is just stuffed in boxes.
100,ep124,And I need to...
101,ep124,I need to get it out.
102,ep124,I love you.
103,ep124,Have a great time.
104,ep124,"I want us to both have what we really want in this next house, but we kinda butt heads and when it comes to who's gonna give more."
105,ep124,It's probably gonna be Chad and not me.
106,ep124,He is so exhausting.
107,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
108,ep124,"First up is a new construction home in the suburb of Lebanon, 30 minutes outside Nashville."
109,ep124,There's some horses and some cows out here.
110,ep124,"I mean, I like the scenery."
111,ep124,It's definitely...
112,ep124,It gives me that out of the city vibe that I want.
113,ep124,But it's definitely further out than what I thought.
114,ep124,How much is this house?
115,ep124,Why don't we just see the house first?
116,ep124,How much is this house?
117,ep124,We'll just go see it.
118,ep124,It's four bedrooms and it's three baths.
119,ep124,Traci had picked it out.
120,ep124,So she wouldn't pick something out if we couldn't make it work.
121,ep124,Chad is a little bit tight when he doesn't like to spend the money.
122,ep124,"Now William, he loves to spend the money."
123,ep124,I thought this house would be good for them because it's got a lot of what they want.
124,ep124,They're gonna get new construction and it's gonna be within their price point.
125,ep124,I think this is a really strong choice for them.
126,ep124,This house is gorgeous.
127,ep124,I love the shutters.
128,ep124,Yeah. guys.
129,ep124,Hello there.
130,ep124,What do you have for us?
131,ep124,Come on in.
132,ep124,-Good to see you.
133,ep124,How is this though?
134,ep124,Don't ask the price yet.
135,ep124,-Let's look at it...
136,ep124,"Yeah. a minute, okay?"
137,ep124,I love these floors.
138,ep124,I love the tall ceilings as soon as you walk in.
139,ep124,You have two bedrooms located on the first floor.
140,ep124,This is the secondary bedroom.
141,ep124,Okay. could be a great office.
142,ep124,Yes. have a nice big island.
143,ep124,I love this countertop.
144,ep124,I love this kitchen.
145,ep124,And it doesn't come with a refrigerator.
146,ep124,That's fine.
147,ep124,"That's like $4,000."
148,ep124,It's no big deal.
149,ep124,We can buy one.
150,ep124,And this...
151,ep124,What is the price -of this house again?
152,ep124,"It's $430,000."
153,ep124,-But it's not gonna be that...
154,ep124,It's only money.
155,ep124,...about more on your monthly payment.
156,ep124,We can make it work.
157,ep124,We knew we'd make it over our...
158,ep124,"I did not want to go over $400,000."
159,ep124,"Well, I knew we were gonna go over our budget."
160,ep124,"Because we're so different with our finances, it can be a little tricky in relationships."
161,ep124,"Where I'm more like, ""Oh, we can just afford it and we'll figure it out later."""
162,ep124,"Where he's like, ""No, no."
163,ep124,"No."" I mean look at the kitchen you get in here."
164,ep124,"I mean, the..."
165,ep124,Yes. kitchen is absolutely gorgeous.
166,ep124,I do really like the two-tone cabinets.
167,ep124,-I like the look of them.
168,ep124,And you like the subway tile?
169,ep124,Yeah. the subway tile is fantastic.
170,ep124,"We love having our family over and friends over and this is kind of what we've been looking for, which is more, like, open down here."
171,ep124,Nice family room.
172,ep124,This is nice.
173,ep124,Yeah. do love the beams.
174,ep124,It's giving me that farmhouse vibe.
175,ep124,And the primary bedroom here.
176,ep124,It is larger but I think the one we have now is longer.
177,ep124,All you need is a bed and TV.
178,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
179,ep124,This is a nice bathroom.
180,ep124,I love this tub.
181,ep124,"I mean, it's way nicer than what we have right now."
182,ep124,"We don't even have a full, it's just a half bath."
183,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
184,ep124,"This is a nice touch, I love this."
185,ep124,Very open.
186,ep124,Yeah. nice being able to see the beams.
187,ep124,"Um, Traci, what is that?"
188,ep124,You're gonna love it.
189,ep124,Come on.
190,ep124,-Don't hit your head here.
191,ep124,It's not even a full door.
192,ep124,I know.
193,ep124,You could finish this off.
194,ep124,This could be Portia's closet.
195,ep124,"I mean, have a long wardrobe with all of my costumes."
196,ep124,So now you wanna spend money.
197,ep124,I would be fine spending my hard-earned money on finishing this for Portia.
198,ep124,"I mean, could you imagine a ten-foot long pole I could have all of my outfits on and my crowns on the wall."
199,ep124,It would be amazing.
200,ep124,I wanna show you the room for your aunt.
201,ep124,This is bigger than the one she currently has.
202,ep124,It's a little bigger.
203,ep124,And she has the bath -right beside the bedroom.
204,ep124,Right beside her.
205,ep124,Nice big bonus room.
206,ep124,I know you would love this because...
207,ep124,This is huge.
208,ep124,I know.
209,ep124,Yeah. would be great to have a place to be able to entertain people up here.
210,ep124,You need a big couch.
211,ep124,You're gonna have a big TV.
212,ep124,"I would love to have a pool table, Traci."
213,ep124,There's no room for a pool table.
214,ep124,This room is huge.
215,ep124,No. with what I want up here.
216,ep124,-No. not how this works.
217,ep124,-See how he does?
218,ep124,-Hey. have to...
219,ep124,-You're gonna have to give and take on this.
220,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
221,ep124,Then you have your other bedroom here.
222,ep124,We do need a guestroom.
223,ep124,I want my mom to be comfortable when she comes to visit us.
224,ep124,You wanna go downstairs now?
225,ep124,-Yeah. want...
226,ep124,I do wanna look at the backyard.
227,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
228,ep124,It's not that big of a yard.
229,ep124,It's not that big of a yard.
230,ep124,"I mean, yeah, it's smaller than what you want, but I mean it's the perfect size for the dogs."
231,ep124,I would like a yard.
232,ep124,But you've got a brand new home.
233,ep124,You have to give and take.
234,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
235,ep124,I don't know if it's my favorite.
236,ep124,I like the new construction.
237,ep124,I like the space in the house.
238,ep124,I love the bonus room.
239,ep124,Being this far out from Nashville is a little concerning.
240,ep124,"I love the kitchen, as well as the unfinished storage."
241,ep124,It has the room for Aunt Nancy that we need that's gonna have the space that she needs.
242,ep124,"However, it's a big jump on the price."
243,ep124,"Yeah, but it's open."
244,ep124,"So as we're entertaining our friends and family, this is great."
245,ep124,But I am very disappointed in the backyard.
246,ep124,It's not my country farm vibe that I was looking for.
247,ep124,"With Chad still wanting land, that's exactly what Traci has lined up."
248,ep124,But it might be too country for William.
249,ep124,Those farm animals ain't stayin'.
250,ep124,"Well, we might..."
251,ep124,Can negotiate that.
252,ep124,-They disagree.
253,ep124,-No. No.
254,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
255,ep124,The house we're going to look at does sit on almost four acres.
256,ep124,Wow. are we gonna do with four acres of land?
257,ep124,I'm gonna go out in the woods and get all muddy.
258,ep124,"Well, you do that and I'll be sitting in the house with my vodka tonic."
259,ep124,These two don't agree on much in Nashville.
260,ep124,"William wants a low maintenance new build, but this time, Chad maybe getting his way, a farmhouse in a rural setting and just a quick 20-minute drive from Nashville."
261,ep124,Oh. is not a paved driveway.
262,ep124,Oh. this is gravel.
263,ep124,-And this is amazing.
264,ep124,Where are you taking me?
265,ep124,This is like what I grew up on.
266,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
267,ep124,I love this.
268,ep124,This house was built in 1975.
269,ep124,It's got the acreage.
270,ep124,It's got farm animals and it brings Chad back to how he grew up.
271,ep124,"William, I'm not sure how he's gonna like it."
272,ep124,"But land not far from downtown, it's pretty rare."
273,ep124,So the land value alone is worth a lot.
274,ep124,Welcome to your mini farm.
275,ep124,Yes. knew you would love it.
276,ep124,-This is...
277,ep124,I love this.
278,ep124,I know.
279,ep124,No. so sure.
280,ep124,You love it.
281,ep124,"It's priced at $390,000."
282,ep124,Oh. acreage is something that I long for.
283,ep124,I love just the feeling of having so much space.
284,ep124,"Oh. just needs some updating, -but it's a great price point."
285,ep124,Yeah. is extremely outdated.
286,ep124,-But I see the good bones.
287,ep124,Yeah. you?
288,ep124,"Yes, I do."
289,ep124,-Traci... can make our own -custom kitchen.
290,ep124,-I understand.
291,ep124,"-But Traci, how much does..."
292,ep124,All right.
293,ep124,...redoing entire kitchen cost?
294,ep124,"Well, you're probably looking at $15,000 to $20,000."
295,ep124,-I know you're overwhelmed.
296,ep124,-Yeah. is a lot.
297,ep124,"I mean, we did..."
298,ep124,It's not about the money.
299,ep124,I don't like messes.
300,ep124,I don't like renovations.
301,ep124,My anxiety goes through the roof and this house needs a lot of work.
302,ep124,"I'm pretty sure this is going to take me a big, big chunk to try to convince him."
303,ep124,But it would most definitely be worth it because of the land.
304,ep124,Secondary bathroom.
305,ep124,"I mean, the vanity is nice."
306,ep124,Lime green is my favorite color but maybe not for a tub.
307,ep124,This would be a great office.
308,ep124,Half could be my office and half of it could be Portia's.
309,ep124,Mmm-hmm. bedroom for Aunt Nancy.
310,ep124,Yeah. do like the two windows.
311,ep124,This room may actually work for Aunt Nancy.
312,ep124,Absolutely. is the primary.
313,ep124,Oh. mean it's a nice room.
314,ep124,Yeah. do have a full bath.
315,ep124,And this looks like it's been somewhat updated.
316,ep124,"Yeah, it is nice."
317,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
318,ep124,This is a great bonus room here though.
319,ep124,"-Oh, my God."
320,ep124,-It's a nice size with the fireplace.
321,ep124,I love that fireplace.
322,ep124,"When we have people over, some sort of bar, some seating."
323,ep124,-It'd be great.
324,ep124,Yeah. love this.
325,ep124,So this could be a wonderful guestroom.
326,ep124,"This paneling is awful, Traci."
327,ep124,"-No, it's not."
328,ep124,-But this is a big bedroom.
329,ep124,You could paint it or you could rip it down -and put the drywall.
330,ep124,This is another complete remodel.
331,ep124,It has a really nice saltwater pool.
332,ep124,"A pool's not something we were necessarily looking for, -but it's nothing either one of us are opposed to."
333,ep124,It's nice to have.
334,ep124,Let's go over and see.
335,ep124,The donkeys may come up here and the horse.
336,ep124,Come on.
337,ep124,"Come on, guys."
338,ep124,Aren't they adorable?
339,ep124,"Come on, sweetie."
340,ep124,Those things are dirty.
341,ep124,"-No, they're not dirty."
342,ep124,They're not dirty.
343,ep124,-They're farm animals.
344,ep124,"Chad, who's maintaining all of this land?"
345,ep124,I will.
346,ep124,But you can leave a lot of it woodsy.
347,ep124,Yeah. don't have to mow everything.
348,ep124,"Plus, the pasture they will eat."
349,ep124,-So you don't have to worry about that.
350,ep124,Exactly. farm animals ain't stayin'.
351,ep124,"Well, we might..."
352,ep124,Can negotiate that.
353,ep124,-They disagree.
354,ep124,No. love the backyard.
355,ep124,I knew you would.
356,ep124,I do.
357,ep124,It's so peaceful here.
358,ep124,It is.
359,ep124,-[donkey braying]
360,ep124,No. says no.
361,ep124,-Okay. that's good for me.
362,ep124,-I love it.
363,ep124,-[William chuckles]
364,ep124,[dramatic music playing]
365,ep124,This house needs a lot of work.
366,ep124,"He wanted something handy, like a handyman project."
367,ep124,This is beyond his handy work.
368,ep124,-This is like a gut...
369,ep124,-I wouldn't do it myself.
370,ep124,You have to remove basically everything in here and redo it.
371,ep124,But it has a lot of potential and it's a great price.
372,ep124,"Doing projects here, it would most definitely be worth it."
373,ep124,Just because there's so much you can do with it.
374,ep124,That sounds like...
375,ep124,-Get a contractor to come in.
376,ep124,Fix the upstairs the way you want it and like it.
377,ep124,And then move up there and then bring them down here.
378,ep124,That sounds exhausting.
379,ep124,"With these two still miles apart, Traci needs to find something that can bring them together."
380,ep124,And she might have found the perfect place.
381,ep124,It may have a little bit of everything that we both want.
382,ep124,"I mean, I'll be curious to see what this house looks like."
383,ep124,Is this it?
384,ep124,Yeah. is it.
385,ep124,[theme music playing]
386,ep124,[doorbell rings]
387,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
388,ep124,Pay attention to the road before I kill you.
389,ep124,I was watching the road.
390,ep124,-Thank you.
391,ep124,-You weren't.
392,ep124,"-Yes, I was."
393,ep124,You almost just -drove us off into a cliff.
394,ep124,-No. no cliffs in Nashville.
395,ep124,William and Chad's house hunt is getting testy and neither is willing to give an inch.
396,ep124,So their agent's lined up a home near their current place that she hopes will get them to meet in the middle.
397,ep124,I do like the location.
398,ep124,I do like that it's an area that we both know.
399,ep124,It looks like it may have a little bit of everything that we both want.
400,ep124,"I mean, I'll be curious to see what this house looks like."
401,ep124,"The only thing about it though, it was built in '93 and it's a traditional style house."
402,ep124,I'm fine with that.
403,ep124,But what's the price?
404,ep124,"Um, $380,000."
405,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
406,ep124,Is this it?
407,ep124,Yeah. is it.
408,ep124,Definitely not mid-century modern.
409,ep124,It's cute.
410,ep124,Let's go check it out.
411,ep124,I think this house would suit either one of them.
412,ep124,It's got a lot of square footage.
413,ep124,It's been remodeled to some degree for William and it's a good price for Chad.
414,ep124,It's a cute neighborhood.
415,ep124,It seems quiet.
416,ep124,I love the neighborhood.
417,ep124,Yeah. to see you.
418,ep124,"You, too."
419,ep124,-This entryway is really nice.
420,ep124,-Yeah. do like it.
421,ep124,-Yeah. is.
422,ep124,"It's spacious, -Yeah, open."
423,ep124,you could put a table right there.
424,ep124,This is the living room but you could use it -for your office.
425,ep124,It would definitely need to be painted.
426,ep124,Because it's...
427,ep124,Yeah. can't have a background of pink -in my video calls.
428,ep124,I love what they did on the walls.
429,ep124,Yeah. like the color in here.
430,ep124,"I love that it's a formal dining room, so it's away from the kitchen."
431,ep124,New construction is really what I like.
432,ep124,This house isn't as new but it's not as outdated as I was scared it might be.
433,ep124,Nice size kitchen.
434,ep124,You have lots of countertops.
435,ep124,It's huge compared to what we have right now.
436,ep124,Large. granite is great.
437,ep124,I'm... don't know if I'm in love with these cabinets.
438,ep124,"Well, they could be painted."
439,ep124,-If you would allow to...
440,ep124,-No. could paint them.
441,ep124,Let's have them professionally painted.
442,ep124,Chad's painting...
443,ep124,Chad has painted cabinets once before and I will never let him do it again.
444,ep124,So... were...
445,ep124,The finished product was nice.
446,ep124,"They were black and shiny, but..."
447,ep124,And that would be a cheaper option for you.
448,ep124,-Yeah. like cheap.
449,ep124,Well... this opens up into your den...
450,ep124,"Yes. you're entertaining, this is the area that people tend to..."
451,ep124,And it has a fireplace.
452,ep124,You have a deck area here and this is privacy-fenced.
453,ep124,This is really small.
454,ep124,"Even for me, this is pretty..."
455,ep124,-We've got four dogs.
456,ep124,...cramped. like this.
457,ep124,And you do have a break in the stairwell.
458,ep124,"Yeah. pretty wide, too."
459,ep124,"Nights you might've had a little bit too much to drink, you have less to fall."
460,ep124,-You know me too well.
461,ep124,-I do know you.
462,ep124,Portia might be coming in from the club and not make it up the stairs.
463,ep124,Oh. gonna make it up.
464,ep124,-This is the primary bedroom.
465,ep124,It's fine.
466,ep124,I feel like it's similar to what we have now.
467,ep124,"This will be another room to paint though, Chad."
468,ep124,You have a separate jetted tub.
469,ep124,-That's nice.
470,ep124,-And a shower.
471,ep124,A nice...
472,ep124,It's a little bit oversized shower.
473,ep124,That's brass.
474,ep124,We just have to gut this.
475,ep124,"Projects like the bathroom make me really uncomfortable and really anxious, and the struggle for me is how long is that whole process gonna go on before we can really just be in here and comfortable and happy with the space."
476,ep124,This is your second bedroom.
477,ep124,Aunt Nancy would need a larger one but this could definitely be Portia's or the guestroom.
478,ep124,This room is a little bit larger than the other one.
479,ep124,I feel like it would be roomy for mom when she comes to visit.
480,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
481,ep124,Aunt Nancy's bath.
482,ep124,Yeah. good the way it is.
483,ep124,"But eventually, we would have to do -some updates in here as well."
484,ep124,"Oh, yeah."
485,ep124,This would be the room I think would be -perfect for Aunt Nancy.
486,ep124,Whoa. is a little bright.
487,ep124,Blue. is like shockingly blue.
488,ep124,It is.
489,ep124,Definitely room for her to put all of her furniture.
490,ep124,-It's more painting.
491,ep124,More painting.
492,ep124,For Chad.
493,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
494,ep124,The bonus room is located over the garage.
495,ep124,-It's a nice big room.
496,ep124,Oh. perfect.
497,ep124,I like the size of this bonus room and it's away.
498,ep124,It's away from all the bedrooms and it's right near the kitchen.
499,ep124,Yeah. is a great space.
500,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
501,ep124,There's your office.
502,ep124,And Portia.
503,ep124,And a room for Aunt Nancy -and for Portia.
504,ep124,-Yes. the location is perfect.
505,ep124,Yeah. love that price.
506,ep124,But I hate the backyard.
507,ep124,-That's... knew that.
508,ep124,But I also am not a huge fan of the fact that this isn't new construction.
509,ep124,This is not as updated as what I want.
510,ep124,"Well, I know that."
511,ep124,But I feel like the updates that we would need to make it's not going to be that costly.
512,ep124,"Painting, fixtures."
513,ep124,"Well, good."
514,ep124,"So, this sounds like it might be an option for you."
515,ep124,-I think so.
516,ep124,Yeah. can discuss it.
517,ep124,Do I think it's the house they might buy?
518,ep124,I don't know.
519,ep124,"I've been doing this for 37 years, so I've learned the hard way."
520,ep124,I don't know what's gonna happen.
521,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
522,ep124,We're gonna sit down and discuss our options.
523,ep124,William and Chad need to come to terms on a new home in Nashville.
524,ep124,"They've seen a wide array of places and now, it's time to decide."
525,ep124,"You know, my favorite house..."
526,ep124,"The new build at $430,000."
527,ep124,No. is over what we agreed we would look at.
528,ep124,"But it's already move in ready, -which would be amazing."
529,ep124,I do love the beams.
530,ep124,There's a great bedroom for Aunt Nancy.
531,ep124,There's a room for your office.
532,ep124,I love the area that we would put Portia in.
533,ep124,And that kitchen was great.
534,ep124,I know you're not thrilled about the size of the yard -but I don't think...
535,ep124,"No, I'm not."
536,ep124,I don't think it was that small.
537,ep124,"But, you know, do we wanna live in Lebanon?"
538,ep124,I'm still leaning more towards the farmhouse.
539,ep124,"Roughly, almost four acres, the price point is $390,000."
540,ep124,-It's in our range.
541,ep124,"Yeah. mean, we're gonna have to do so many updates in there."
542,ep124,I know.
543,ep124,It's a fixer-upper.
544,ep124,I agree.
545,ep124,But it's close to downtown.
546,ep124,I'm really just concerned about all of the construction.
547,ep124,But I feel like we could spin it and be happy there.
548,ep124,There's a great bedroom for Aunt Nancy.
549,ep124,There would still be room for Portia.
550,ep124,I would have an office.
551,ep124,There is an in-ground pool that neither one of us were expecting.
552,ep124,Do we really need that much land?
553,ep124,It would be nice.
554,ep124,"But then there's the traditional home -for $380,000."
555,ep124,"You know, -it's not the turnkey that I wanted..."
556,ep124,"No. doesn't require a ton -of updates, which is great."
557,ep124,"-That blue room, -Aunt Nancy's bedroom there."
558,ep124,Right. gonna be doing a lot of painting.
559,ep124,The neighborhood is nice and I love the area.
560,ep124,"Yeah. do like the size of that kitchen, but there are some things in there I would like to change."
561,ep124,There's room for Portia.
562,ep124,I have an office.
563,ep124,I'm not somebody who likes a ton of yard...
564,ep124,I know.
565,ep124,"...but for me, that yard is small."
566,ep124,I know which one I want.
567,ep124,Do you know which one you want?
568,ep124,[upbeat music playing]
569,ep124,[doorbell rings]
570,ep124,Do you know how many people are coming?
571,ep124,I don't know.
572,ep124,I think six.
573,ep124,We chose the new build.
574,ep124,"I was really looking for something that was turnkey and that was really, -really important to me."
575,ep124,-And it's beautiful inside.
576,ep124,"It does have the beams that I like, the farmhouse vibe."
577,ep124,"And Aunt Nancy has the space that she really wanted so, all around, -it just works out."
578,ep124,Yeah. two of them.
579,ep124,"You do one, -I do the other."
580,ep124,"-No. the house was listed for $430,000."
581,ep124,"And in this market, we offered full ask and we got it."
582,ep124,I am comfortable with the mortgage price and it is good to know that there's not a lot of expensive projects we need to do in this house.
583,ep124,Yeah. wanna show you what I would like to do in here.
584,ep124,"As far as Portia's room is concerned, I'm really excited, like, to get that started."
585,ep124,"I'm going to do the floors, the walls' insulation, all of that fun stuff."
586,ep124,It sounds absolutely horrible.
587,ep124,It sounds amazing and fun to me.
588,ep124,Let's have a drink before everyone gets here.
589,ep124,"Here, unfortunately, I don't get my acreage."
590,ep124,The distance still concerns me a little.
591,ep124,"But the location is great in Lebanon, it's right off the highway so it's an easy drive."
592,ep124,"I feel like we can really get to know our neighbors here and just build a little community, which I think is really important."
593,ep124,I'm excited to have a block party.
594,ep124,"Hey, mom."
595,ep124,Say hey to William.
596,ep124,"Hey, William."
597,ep124,"-Hi. up on eight-acres in the country in this just little bitty house, I've personally never seen myself being able to get into something like this."
598,ep124,"I mean, I've always seen myself living in a house like this."
599,ep124,"Maybe in a house even bigger, but that's for a different time."
1,ep125,I'm super place.
2,ep125,excited about this Goth.
3,ep125,"Madison wants a Victorian in Virginia Beach, since that speaks to her inner dragons."
4,ep125,-Look. handles are that.
5,ep125,And amazing.
6,ep125,This is marble.
7,ep125,It's dream.
8,ep125,"Give me a dark study and honestly, I'd be in a conventional."
9,ep125,But Vernon wants their home to be more gorgeous.
10,ep125,-This is kids.
11,ep125,Mmm-hmm. feel that it's a better home for us to move right in with the fixers.
12,ep125,"Since Madison's their agent, she's trying to meet him halfway, but to stay in his price range could mean looking at go."
13,ep125,Okay. we into?
14,ep125,What have you gotten us dings]
15,ep125,[doorbell playing]
16,ep125,[theme music playing]
17,ep125,[upbeat music Dada.
18,ep125,-Hey. contractor.
19,ep125,"I'm actually a broker, uh, and a agent."
20,ep125,I'm a real estate pictures.
21,ep125,-Drawing some ago.
22,ep125,-Mmm-hmm. got together about three years man.
23,ep125,I attended a networking event for real estate and I could not take my eyes off this off.
24,ep125,Our relationship basically took since.
25,ep125,"We decided to get married, uh, about a year ago and it's been great party."
26,ep125,-It's a birthday hands?
27,ep125,-Yup. where are your here.
28,ep125,-My hands are right kids.
29,ep125,-I have three fifteen-year-old.
30,ep125,"So, we have a three-year-old, we have a six-year-old, and we have a here."
31,ep125,The house that we're living in currently is actually the very first house that I bought myself and it was great until there was a family nightmare.
32,ep125,"I love them, but this place is a space."
33,ep125,We need now.
34,ep125,"In addition to just growing out of the home that we're in already, future plans, we want kids of our own and we just don't have the space right in."
35,ep125,I've actually never bought a home for me to live myself.
36,ep125,"I've bought under my business 40 to 50 homes to flip, to renovate, but I've never actually owned one settling."
37,ep125,"But now that my girls have gotten bigger, it's making me realize maybe it's time to find something a little more yet?"
38,ep125,Is anybody getting hungry good.
39,ep125,"-Yes. cook something $500,000."
40,ep125,"A good price point for us would be around the $400,000 range, really would like to stay looser."
41,ep125,"You know, we do pretty well with our businesses and I feel like our wallet should be a little apartment."
42,ep125,"Honestly, I was born and raised with a silver spoon in my mouth until my dad's business crashed and we went from this 3,000 square foot home to a thousand square foot family."
43,ep125,And my goal was that I could provide that big beautiful home for my family and keep it one day when I had a home.
44,ep125,"The style of home I'm really looking for is brick because being in the construction building world, you see a lot of repairs when you're dealing with a lot of vinyl and wood so I'm looking for a traditional all-brick Victorian."
45,ep125,My vision of a perfect home would be a moodiness.
46,ep125,"Back in my high school years, I tried to be as goth as I could, so having that Victorian home just makes me feel at home and in my on."
47,ep125,"Watch out, I'm about to turn that burner plastic."
48,ep125,I don't wanna melt the be?
49,ep125,Where am I supposed to know.
50,ep125,I don't house.
51,ep125,This was your cooking.
52,ep125,I do a lot of kitchen.
53,ep125,"So, I know one of the big things I'm certainly looking for is a big space."
54,ep125,-We need even more open kitchen.
55,ep125,Uh-huh. wanna be able to see the girls when they're playing -while we're in the fine.
56,ep125,-It's directions.
57,ep125,"Certainly preferred move-in ready, 'cause our jobs and our careers just take us in many comfortable."
58,ep125,"So, I really would like something that we can just take the whole family, move right on in, sit back and be though."
59,ep125,"Now, of course because we do have the team, I'm okay and open to a home that might need a little bit of work, really don't wanna go too heavy though."
60,ep125,"With his price range, we're going to need to go that heavy eat."
61,ep125,"Girls, time to it..."
62,ep125,"One thing that we really honestly want is something that our kids can grow up in, have memories, make those memories with friends, family, where they can come home when we've grown old and they can be like, this is still our home, and that."
63,ep125,I just love playing]
64,ep125,[upbeat music place.
65,ep125,I'm super excited about this found.
66,ep125,"First up, a 1901 Victorian that Madison's be."
67,ep125,"It is $500,000, right where you wanna old."
68,ep125,These are just so playing]
69,ep125,[upbeat music balance.
70,ep125,"It's absolutely hard to wear both agent and wife hat, because right now I'm thinking about what I wanna live in, but my husband has a completely different way of thinking, so it's really hard to me."
71,ep125,"He's very good about visualizing things when he wants to, so hopefully he'll be a little bit compromising with Victorians."
72,ep125,I see we're looking at nothing but okay?
73,ep125,"Just keep an open mind, dragons."
74,ep125,-Look. handles are home.
75,ep125,"The exterior, not one brick around and also as far as for the age of the home, it's about a hundred and twenty years old, that's a big drawback for me 'cause I'd be concerned about future issues to have where we're upkeeping the my."
76,ep125,"Oh, entrance."
77,ep125,This is an entrance.
78,ep125,Wow. is a very old windows.
79,ep125,"Oh, bay on."
80,ep125,Come character.
81,ep125,"Now, that's space."
82,ep125,It's good kids?
83,ep125,You think this would be enough for three dog?
84,ep125,"-Yeah. another, a space."
85,ep125,"-Yes. 6,500 square feet, I'm sure this isn't the only living not."
86,ep125,I hope stunning.
87,ep125,"Look at this, it's big."
88,ep125,This is room.
89,ep125,"So, this is the dining forgotten."
90,ep125,"Oh, the view we have is one of my wish lists that was had."
91,ep125,It's a reminder this is the house we could have laughs]
92,ep125,-[Madison work.
93,ep125,"Okay. the way, there's seven fireplaces and they all okay."
94,ep125,"Seven 120-year-old fireplaces that all work, getting..."
95,ep125,I'm walls.
96,ep125,I'm kinda getting concerned -with the out.
97,ep125,"-Oh. Victorians don't really have a lot of the features that I look for in a home, particularly how the rooms are laid family."
98,ep125,"You know, closed rooms and walls, and kitchens that are far off away from the living room whereas that's one of the features we were hoping to have to get close to the huge."
99,ep125,"This is the kitchen though, and this is kitchen."
100,ep125,I do like the there.
101,ep125,The girls could be eating here while we're cooking other.
102,ep125,"I do like the fact that I could still have all the counter space I need to cook while the girls can still talk, run, play, we don't need to worry about bouncing into each here."
103,ep125,"The appliances could use a little updating, but it's really good in backyard."
104,ep125,And let's check out the my.
105,ep125,Ooh. fitting...
106,ep125,How do you feel about here?
107,ep125,"Three kids, a dog, and possibly more back nearby."
108,ep125,-I'll find a park top?
109,ep125,Okay. start at the see.
110,ep125,Let's beautiful.

118,ep125,Yeah. floor.
119,ep125,This takes us out to the second bedrooms.
120,ep125,"So, on this floor is pretty much all the rooms."
121,ep125,"We'd have plenty of things to do, I mean, we have rooms that we can turn into office, playroom, music mine."
122,ep125,The character makes this honestly such a dream of different.
123,ep125,Every room had a chandelier that was 1900s.
124,ep125,"All the molding, even the original hardwood floors from the dream."
125,ep125,"Bring in my goth area, put some huge bookshelves in one of the rooms, give me a dark study and honestly, I'd be in a primary."
126,ep125,-This one's our on...
127,ep125,-Rooms and now we're fireplace.
128,ep125,Oh. it has another another.
129,ep125,There's one.

138,ep125,"Yeah. everything, except for that open concept -I know you were hoping did."
139,ep125,It that.
140,ep125,"We definitely have all the room in the kitchen, so I definitely love kids."
141,ep125,"It was just really more so, you know, the walls, so obviously being able to see the just..."
142,ep125,"I understand, I here."
143,ep125,I feel like we have all of our possibilities for.
144,ep125,I think you definitely batted a thousand out of exactly what you were looking dream.
145,ep125,This is absolutely my character.
146,ep125,Big Victorian with so much us.
147,ep125,"The layout, my husband wasn't too keen on, but I know I could make this work for playing]"
148,ep125,[upbeat music for.
149,ep125,"Still, Madison's gone ahead and found something that's more Vernon style with the open layout he's looking ready."
150,ep125,But it's not move-in already.
151,ep125,"We probably already got about $40,000, $45,000 -into this fun."
152,ep125,"-Oh, that's playing]"
153,ep125,[upbeat music houses.
154,ep125,"Look around this neighborhood, I mean, all I'm seeing are brick start."
155,ep125,That is a good see.
156,ep125,"In the battle of traditional brick versus goth Victorian, Madison has gone ahead and lined up the type of home Vernon wants to $435,000."
157,ep125,Okay. listed at picky.
158,ep125,"Whoa. don't know if that means that there's a lot of work, so just don't be tree."
159,ep125,I'm guessing the house is the one hiding behind this gigantic it.
160,ep125,It looks like playing]
161,ep125,[upbeat music brick.
162,ep125,"Well, it's all brick."
163,ep125,"I do have to say, Madison certainly nailed it with the exterior with all the age."
164,ep125,"Granted, it's a little dirty, but those things can be touched up, cleaned, regardless of the direction."
165,ep125,"So, we're at least one right foot in the right no."
166,ep125,"Oh, shorter?"
167,ep125,Could the ceiling be any wallpaper.
168,ep125,Okay. all this mirrors.
169,ep125,-Wow. room.
170,ep125,Yeah. this is a really good sized here.
171,ep125,"Oh, we got a leak happening dollars."
172,ep125,We're already adding on the molding.
173,ep125,"I will admit though, I mean I do like the crown things?"
174,ep125,Can we keep the little tapestry curtain gosh.
175,ep125,-Character. bedrooms.
176,ep125,We can go take a look at the right.
177,ep125,All wallpaper.
178,ep125,And more and more repair.
179,ep125,"This alone, we're talking about $8,000 to $10,000 just to remove all this and repair the walls that we have to room."
180,ep125,"This will be the guests, second size."
181,ep125,"All right, good uh..."
182,ep125,-Yup. three.
183,ep125,-And door number roof?
184,ep125,Do you know the age of the original.
185,ep125,"I don't, but I'm gonna assume roof."
186,ep125,"Yeah. is gonna need an entire new $20,000."
187,ep125,"Wow. this size is gonna be probably another $18,000, maybe least."
188,ep125,I do like the room size at then.
189,ep125,This has to be the primary bedroom wanted.
190,ep125,And it's smaller than what I would have thought?
191,ep125,Smaller than you toiletries.
192,ep125,Yeah. this is the secret garden of laughs]
193,ep125,-[Madison more...
194,ep125,-So we got through...
195,ep125,"more wallpaper, and it goes all the way counters."
196,ep125,And yellow be...
197,ep125,-This is gonna gut.
198,ep125,-Complete gut.
199,ep125,It's gonna have to be a complete into?
200,ep125,-What have you gotten us already.
201,ep125,"Well, we're upstairs, we probably already got about $45,000 into this fun."
202,ep125,"Oh, that's go."
203,ep125,-Here we purple.
204,ep125,"Wow, more everywhere."
205,ep125,Purple ideal.
206,ep125,Yes. this is very space.
207,ep125,Really wide open girls.
208,ep125,This is what I was imagining for the to...
209,ep125,It completely opens to the kitchen and room.
210,ep125,I guess that's the formal living that.
211,ep125,I will admit this room almost very little -to really do and amazing.
212,ep125,This is fireplace.
213,ep125,That is an outstanding marble.
214,ep125,-It's me.
215,ep125,-Wow. feels elegant to agree.
216,ep125,I piano.
217,ep125,-I can see hardwood floors and a grand wanted.
218,ep125,This very moody fireplace room speaks to my goth soul and basically makes me feel like I'm in that Victorian home that I amazing.
219,ep125,I think the potential in this house is project.
220,ep125,I just don't know if it's gonna be too much -of a room.
221,ep125,-I do like this look.
222,ep125,"My concerns here, I'm looking at all these skylights, wow, through."
223,ep125,Every single skylight is leaking leaking.
224,ep125,Is one.
225,ep125,Every single out.
226,ep125,"I'm looking at lighting, electrical, popcorn ceilings to smooth now."
227,ep125,"We've gotta be up to about the 60s, 70s see."
228,ep125,"Doing as many projects as I've done, of course the renovations that are really needed, that's all I tend to higher."
229,ep125,I just saw the price tag just collecting higher and over.
230,ep125,"The price on paper looked really good, but the whole house needs an entire work deck."
231,ep125,Let's take a look at the tape.
232,ep125,"Oh, I see caution that."
233,ep125,Geez. look at deck.
234,ep125,Yeah. so obviously redoing an entire huge.
235,ep125,The yard's deck.
236,ep125,Redoing the yard.
237,ep125,That is a big plus.
238,ep125,that's a big space.
239,ep125,"Mmm-hmm. this place is incredible, this place."
240,ep125,"I could see us cooking, doing our thing in here while the girls are going crazy running around this entire gut."
241,ep125,"But again, it is a complete appliances."
242,ep125,"We've gotta be up around $75,000, $80,000 with a complete gut in the kitchen, new contractor."
243,ep125,"Well, thank God, you're a discount."
244,ep125,-Get a good playing]
245,ep125,[upbeat music price?
246,ep125,What's the listing it.
247,ep125,"They're asking $435,000 for roof."
248,ep125,"We have to rebuild most, if not all, of the interior, big $520,000."
249,ep125,"Once we're all done, $510,000, at..."
250,ep125,-Mmm-hmm. what we're probably -looking exterior.
251,ep125,"-I mean, that's right around what we thought we are gonna end up at, -brick exterior."
252,ep125,The brick space.
253,ep125,It's mostly community me.
254,ep125,"I know it's a lot of work, but the houses that I'm finding aren't your brick, so that's the only reason it makes sense to be."
255,ep125,"So, we also got to think about the girls too, you know, where the girls are gonna be, where the family is gonna well."
256,ep125,"You know, during all these renovations as ready."
257,ep125,There's gotta be something that's at least more move-in wants.
258,ep125,"So now, Madison's found a place that's more turn-key, but it means giving up the charm she character."
259,ep125,-It does have some know.
260,ep125,-I don't me.
261,ep125,I... feels a little forced to molding?
262,ep125,-Forced? crown playing]
263,ep125,[theme music playing]
264,ep125,[upbeat music homes.
265,ep125,Thank you for not taking me to any of the 100 or 200 or 300-year-old desire.
266,ep125,-That you desperately updated.
267,ep125,"After seeing a century-old Victorian for her, and an all-brick traditional for him that needed a lot of work, Madison's found something that still has his style, but is fully brick."
268,ep125,"It's a five-bedroom, three full bath, 3,500 square feet and of course, all it."
269,ep125,"-You're gonna love $525,000."
270,ep125,-Okay. it's listed at under.
271,ep125,Okay. you are over the value I wanted to stay though.
272,ep125,This is what I told you do.
273,ep125,"If you want everything that you want, then that's what we're gonna have to huh?"
274,ep125,"So, it's gonna come down to if it's worth it or not, man."
275,ep125,Yup. time.
276,ep125,You've done it well this one.
277,ep125,I figured you'd like this around.
278,ep125,Brick all in.
279,ep125,Ooh-wee! on ceiling.
280,ep125,Look at the detail.
281,ep125,That is incredible area.
282,ep125,It's like a sitting room through.
283,ep125,Crown molding all the way area.
284,ep125,"Yeah. could be a nice little formal area, maybe play too."
285,ep125,"-Maybe an office, girls."
286,ep125,-For the too.
287,ep125,"You're right, yeah, could be an office, fireplace."
288,ep125,Main living room with a gorgeous.
289,ep125,This is exterior.
290,ep125,Mmm-hmm. the same brick from the built-in.
291,ep125,That makes it look really sharp with the awesome.
292,ep125,Built-ins are me.
293,ep125,Kinda seems a little small to walls.
294,ep125,-I'm seeing a lot of up.
295,ep125,"Yeah. it's real easy to just remove this wall right here, -open the whole thing back kitchen."
296,ep125,Okay. I like this and this here.
297,ep125,This kitchen is doing it for me right find.
298,ep125,"Really? it's a wide kitchen, this is hard to space."
299,ep125,It's not open to the living side.
300,ep125,"True, we did at least have this little window right here just in case we have the kids on the other location."
301,ep125,"Just a couple thousand, I might be able to open something else as far as moving the fridge to a different openness."
302,ep125,At least have some done.
303,ep125,"The house is unfortunately over my max by about $25,000, but everything was already updated for the most part, so there's very little that has to be at."
304,ep125,"She did make up some good points in regards to kinda closed rooms, the walls, I need to put in money into a home that is over the value I was maxed out kids."
305,ep125,"But at least overall, I feel that it's a better home for us because it's less work, less money that I have to put in to move right in with the bedroom."
306,ep125,"So, we have a bathroom right here with a connected probably."
307,ep125,This is like the darkest room house.
308,ep125,Right. the end.
309,ep125,It's right here all by itself to the room.
310,ep125,This could be your goth go.
311,ep125,-Yeah. you and...
312,ep125,Whole library thinking...
313,ep125,I'm have...
314,ep125,"I'm thinking, you be."
315,ep125,"you have dark painted walls, you can put some trees, ravens, I don't know, whatever that might work."
316,ep125,My husband totally threw in that goth room for me and it didn't really home.
317,ep125,"Unfortunately, I don't think that I can get the uniqueness that I'm looking for in this me."
318,ep125,It's a little too cookie cutter for want.
319,ep125,I can't really see myself renovating this place to give it the character that I here.
320,ep125,-One bedroom right nursery.
321,ep125,"Yeah. could be Anastasia and Cecelia's bedroom, primary."
322,ep125,And here's the ceiling.
323,ep125,"Oh, I love the creative."
324,ep125,"Beams that come across, that's very molding."
325,ep125,"People don't use beams like that just for show, just for the nice."
326,ep125,"That's good traditional character, -that's really nice."
327,ep125,-It is really.
328,ep125,But we could do that in any house to.
329,ep125,"We could but, I don't have home."
330,ep125,My husband's pretty sold on this accessories.
331,ep125,"The crown molding, the wainscoting, all the accessories are fantastic here, but that's what they are, they're anywhere."
332,ep125,I could put that opinion.
333,ep125,"I've been very compromising as much as I can be, but I need my own home."
334,ep125,"I'm gonna live here too, and don't think my wants are possible in this type of very traditional size..."
335,ep125,-The room ceilings.
336,ep125,-Uh-huh. bigger because of the tray does.
337,ep125,It bedrooms.
338,ep125,But it's smaller than any of the other primary right.
339,ep125,Yeah. doable.
340,ep125,"It's a little bit smaller, but I think and..."
341,ep125,We spend most of our time down there this.
342,ep125,We have a lot more furniture than playing]
343,ep125,[upbeat music patio.
344,ep125,An all-brick nice.
345,ep125,Porch. is anymore.
346,ep125,People just don't have this agent.
347,ep125,"-Way to go, you."
348,ep125,Thank wife?
349,ep125,What'd you do with my here?
350,ep125,What do we got out backyard.
351,ep125,It's a good size us.
352,ep125,I do like that there's no neighbors behind around.
353,ep125,"Love the shed, plenty of room for the kids to run this."
354,ep125,The dog is gonna go crazy over here.
355,ep125,"Mmm-hmm. mean, everyone is gonna be completely happy playing]"
356,ep125,[upbeat music one.
357,ep125,"As far as I'm concerned, this has got to be the me."
358,ep125,"It's a beautiful option, -but it's plain to you?"
359,ep125,It's plain to character.
360,ep125,-Yeah. does have some know.
361,ep125,I don't me.
362,ep125,It feels a little forced to molding?
363,ep125,Forced? crown though?
364,ep125,What about the space roll.
365,ep125,"I mean, look at this kitchen, we don't have to gut it out entirely, we got this space here for the kids to run around, do their circles on their scooters, you know how they like to though."
366,ep125,-It'd still be tight so?
367,ep125,-You think walls.
368,ep125,Until you bust out less.
369,ep125,"We're only talking about maybe $4,000 or $5,000, so I'm willing to pay a little bit more if I can do just..."
370,ep125,I know.
371,ep125,I don't playing]
372,ep125,[upbeat music sweetie.
373,ep125,"-Hey, babe."
374,ep125,"-Hey, home."
375,ep125,Madison and Vernon have to decide how much they're willing to spend and how much work they're willing to do to get the space and character they want in a new family Victorian.
376,ep125,Let's start with my it.
377,ep125,"Obviously, I love home."
378,ep125,I love how many rooms there were and all the possibilities that we can create with that find.
379,ep125,"Well, being priced at $500,000, we all know the house was renovated real nice, I was very concerned about because of the age, if there's anything we wish to change, like trying to open the place up, who knows what we'll too."
380,ep125,"My big concern with that one was the yard size, great."
381,ep125,"I will hand it to you though, that pool room, that was brick."
382,ep125,But there was absolutely zero house.
383,ep125,"So, let's talk about the tree exterior."
384,ep125,It did have a brick concept.
385,ep125,"Mmm-hmm. did have a very open $435,000."
386,ep125,Looking at that one around construction.
387,ep125,There is a little bit of space to work with as far as with job.
388,ep125,My concern is how much is the complete gut overwhelmed.
389,ep125,"At first, I was completely like."
390,ep125,"But at the same time, we could turn it into something that maybe both of us could work."
391,ep125,It's just a lot of work.
392,ep125,-Yeah. a lot of home.
393,ep125,There is that gorgeous traditional modern brick size.
394,ep125,"The renovations that were already completed, the fantastic."
395,ep125,I will admit being able to move in right away would be forced.
396,ep125,"I do wanna say, the character, I mean, it just kinda seemed on."
397,ep125,"-Oh, come playing]"
398,ep125,[upbeat music dings]
399,ep125,-[bell barking]
400,ep125,[dog house.
401,ep125,We ended up choosing the tree one.
402,ep125,Turned out to be the else.
403,ep125,"What brought my attention is that of course we can build the character that she was looking for, but the fact that we do have the open space we really couldn't find anywhere nice."
404,ep125,It's huge.
405,ep125,"The kitchen is $451,000."
406,ep125,"The price was originally at $435,000, we did get in a bit of a bidding war, finishing out at $500,000."
407,ep125,"And then, we still have construction right behind it, so I did have to compromise that and get out of my comfort zone of over on."
408,ep125,"And of course, I really wanted a move-in home, so that was a big compromise for me, I have to put my hard hat want."
409,ep125,"In the end, we're gonna redo this whole home, so it'll be exactly what both of us purple?"
410,ep125,-Do you like the sweetheart.
411,ep125,-Yes. staying.
412,ep125,Yeah. not of.
413,ep125,"So, the first thing we definitely have to do to make sure that it's livable, is taking care of the roof and then of course after that, the kitchen is actually one of the first bigger ones to take care floors."
414,ep125,"Appliances, whole new countertops, cabinets, and then eventually working our way upstairs to the bathrooms, and the bedrooms, and excited?"
415,ep125,Are you so excited?
416,ep125,-Yes. so dream.
417,ep125,Yeah. has turned into a back.
418,ep125,"I mean, I grew up having something similar to this size, and this is what I've always wanted family."
419,ep125,"With the size family that we have and have as much room as we have, we are certainly a lot more comfortable about, you know, growing the started."
420,ep125,"And I feel as for this house being our first purchase together, and of course my first home to share it with my wife and the family, I feel absolutely amazing, and excited, and ready to get it"

2,ep126,This is more like it.
3,ep126,Ian and Dawn met at a punk concert so it's no surprise they want a house in New Jersey they can get loud in.
4,ep126,We've been in separate bands before and we really would like to start a band together.
5,ep126,We don't have to worry about neighbors banging on the walls.

7,ep126,He's also a former chef who wants a gourmet kitchen.
8,ep126,He's gonna go right to the kitchen.
9,ep126,"Oh, this great."
10,ep126,"She wants her own dedicated room, too."
11,ep126,"This could be the glam room, yeah."
12,ep126,There you go.
13,ep126,"See? with limited funds and a tight market, getting it all would be impossible."
14,ep126,"If I'm laying down in the bed, I don't wanna sit up and whack my head on that."
15,ep126,"Oh, my gosh, I wasn't even thinking that."
16,ep126,"If we don't make a decision this weekend, we're gonna be stuck in a lease for another year."

31,ep126,"-I know, right?"
32,ep126,-Come on inside.
33,ep126,"We've been together for about three years in Boston where we've been renting with our dog, Leo."
34,ep126,"Boston is expensive, plus we really want to come back to New Jersey to be closer to friends and family."
35,ep126,So how long did the drive -take you to get here?
36,ep126,-Four hours.
37,ep126,We've been driving down here every weekend.
38,ep126,"Yeah, staying at a friend's house."
39,ep126,[playing music guitar]
40,ep126,We've been in separate bands before and we really would like to start a band together.
41,ep126,And we want to adopt one or two kids.
42,ep126,We want a yard for Leo.
43,ep126,"-Sounds nice, too."
44,ep126,Yeah. yeah.
45,ep126,-Yeah. thought that it was best to start looking for a house and really taking that next big step.
46,ep126,"I'm not just comfortable going higher than $375,000."
47,ep126,"Ian here feels more comfortable going up to $400,000."
48,ep126,"If it's the right house, we can afford it."
49,ep126,"That's a lot of money and we're first-time homebuyers, so."
50,ep126,Yeah. shopper over here.
51,ep126,He's kind of a dreamer where he thinks we can afford everything whereas I'm more practical.
52,ep126,She won't pay full price for a box of cereal.
53,ep126,"I learned that from my father because he was very, very good with his money."
54,ep126,"When I was growing up, we didn't have a lot of money."
55,ep126,"Now, that I've got a great career, I should have the freedom to get I want."
56,ep126,What kind of house are you guys looking for?
57,ep126,I really like Cape Cods.
58,ep126,I think they're cute.
59,ep126,They have a lot of character.
60,ep126,I don't fit in Cape Cods half the time.
61,ep126,"You walk in the upstairs in one of those, I get to stand in the middle of the room."
62,ep126,I'm too big.
63,ep126,I like ranches because the ceilings are higher.
64,ep126,I don't have to worry about bumping my head in the stairwell.
65,ep126,I want four bedrooms.
66,ep126,I don't wanna get too big of a house or too much house.
67,ep126,"So, I don't think we need more than three."
68,ep126,We were cramped in our one-bedroom apartment.
69,ep126,I wanna be a little bit more free.
70,ep126,We have 11 stringed instruments so we want a space to practice.
71,ep126,"A basement, a garage, just something that we could jam."
72,ep126,"-Yeah. know, you can come over, we can start jamming and playing music again."
73,ep126,That's awesome.
74,ep126,I am really focused on the kitchen because I was a chef for years and I need a place that I can cook for friends.
75,ep126,I don't wanna be closed off.
76,ep126,He is the one that does most of the cooking and then I can still hangout in the living room.
77,ep126,I'm interested also in possibly having a glam room.
78,ep126,"Uh, I'd love turn one of the bedrooms into a giant walk-in closet."
79,ep126,Glam room is gone after you have kids.
80,ep126,"When it comes to, like, my purses and stuff, it's the one area that I actually splurge."
81,ep126,"And that's the issue with the three bedrooms, is I need a home office."
82,ep126,"So, uh, work comes before play, dear."
83,ep126,"I would love to have a pool, um, or at least a space where we could put an above ground pool because I've wanted my own yard for a while since we've lived in big cities."
84,ep126,"We got to find a house first but, oh, we're working on it."
85,ep126,"We've been working with our agent, Todd, long distance which has been a real challenge."
86,ep126,Houses would get listed and sold in the same day.
87,ep126,We have to find a house this weekend or we might have to re-sign a lease.
88,ep126,It's really now or never.
89,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
90,ep126,This neighborhood's cute.
91,ep126,-Yeah. homey.
92,ep126,Lots of trick or treaters.
93,ep126,"Oh, that'll be awesome."
94,ep126,How much is it?
95,ep126,"$379,000. mean it's on the high side but it does say recently renovated, so..."
96,ep126,What is it?
97,ep126,What kind of house?
98,ep126,-It's a Cape.
99,ep126,"-Well, I hope I fit in it."
100,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
101,ep126,It's cute.
102,ep126,How was your trip?
103,ep126,Pretty good.
104,ep126,Good? market's very competitive right now.
105,ep126,Houses are being sold in a couple of days.
106,ep126,Ian and Dawn have to act quick and they have to realize they're not just gonna get everything that they want.
107,ep126,"So, they may have to compromise just a little bit."
108,ep126,"The house I'm showing today is newly renovated with a partially finished basement, a nice area for their band."
109,ep126,"So, here you got a sun porch."
110,ep126,This is really nice.
111,ep126,-A ceiling fan here.
112,ep126,I can definitely see having coffee out here.
113,ep126,And this...
114,ep126,"Look at the floors, -they're so nice."
115,ep126,"Okay. all looks pretty new, too."
116,ep126,The floor.
117,ep126,"Yeah, tile floor."
118,ep126,"-So, here you got nice..."
119,ep126,Oh. floors.
120,ep126,-All the floors are refinished.
121,ep126,-Look at this window.
122,ep126,You shouldn't have to refinish these floors for the next 20 years.
123,ep126,"The rooms seem a little bit small but honestly coming from a one-bedroom apartment, like any..."
124,ep126,This is an improvement.
125,ep126,"Well, you got this room here also, although I'm gonna say your dining room table's -gonna be there."
126,ep126,-I like the gray because I am a big gray with white trim fan.
127,ep126,"Okay. a nice space but when I'm cooking dinner for everybody, I'm gonna have to walk it all the way down here."
128,ep126,"Ian, remember on the phone when we talked about there might be a possibility that you might have to compromise something?"
129,ep126,Yeah. your something.
130,ep126,"Yeah, this would work though."
131,ep126,"Kitchen, you have all new appliances."
132,ep126,"-Oh, yeah, gas stove."
133,ep126,-Oh. huge.
134,ep126,"It's not a chef's kitchen, there's no island."
135,ep126,It's not as open concept as we wanted.
136,ep126,And I like to hang out in the living room -while you're cooking usually.
137,ep126,Right. we don't have that but...
138,ep126,It's definitely a little tight.
139,ep126,Mmm-hmm. but it's doable.
140,ep126,Bathroom. look at the tile.
141,ep126,You know what's cool?
142,ep126,-I can fit.
143,ep126,-You can fit in the shower.
144,ep126,Yeah. might be an issue.
145,ep126,Oh. with your size perhaps.
146,ep126,-[Dawn laughing]
147,ep126,-I guess...
148,ep126,I mean...
149,ep126,We can get you some...
150,ep126,Is that okay?
151,ep126,"I'm not gonna go spend a lot of time in here but, you know."
152,ep126,We can get this reduced maybe.
153,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
154,ep126,This would be the only bedroom on this floor.
155,ep126,"I mean it's fine, except there's no closet."
156,ep126,I was gonna say there's no closet.
157,ep126,At all.
158,ep126,-A queen bed.
159,ep126,"It's fine for a spare room that people aren't gonna be in very often, but..."
160,ep126,This could actually be a spare.
161,ep126,"And eventually if we adopt, it could be a child's room."
162,ep126,"Well, we do have two more bedrooms upstairs."
163,ep126,"Okay. think the ceiling height here might be just slightly lower, but I think you fit."
164,ep126,This would be the main bedroom.
165,ep126,Oh. it's a little doorway.
166,ep126,Yeah. it's a little tight up here.
167,ep126,"If I'm laying down in the bed, I don't wanna sit up and whack my head on here."
168,ep126,"Oh, my gosh, I wasn't even thinking that."
169,ep126,-No sit-ups in the bed.
170,ep126,"Yeah, I just have to tuck and roll out."
171,ep126,The ceiling's right above of my head.
172,ep126,"The pitch of the walls and the roof, it's..."
173,ep126,That's that feeling where I feel like I'm running out of room.
174,ep126,This is used for storage.
175,ep126,It does a have a lot of shelving and you don't have a ceiling fan that's gonna whack you in the head.
176,ep126,Okay. this kind of makes up for the lack of closet space.
177,ep126,Because this is like a giant walk-in closet.
178,ep126,I think it will work for storage.
179,ep126,"I could definitely see us really utilizing that, me being able to display my handbags."
180,ep126,"We would have to figure out the office, the spare room, like, that's lacking."
181,ep126,"Guys, there's still some more space that we could use in the basement."
182,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
183,ep126,This is more like it.
184,ep126,"And this would be a good space for band, band practice."
185,ep126,"Yeah, definitely rock down here."
186,ep126,"Yeah, we don't have to worry about neighbors banging on the walls."
187,ep126,"-Honestly, this is huge."
188,ep126,Yeah. do have a partial bathroom You have room to sit on this one.
189,ep126,Yeah. office space here.
190,ep126,I don't need a lot of office space.
191,ep126,Right. can make this work.
192,ep126,"If you wanna finish it, I got a guy."
193,ep126,"We're talking maybe $25,000 down here to build this out."
194,ep126,"Okay. mean, now things are adding up because this house is at the top of what I'm comfortable with."
195,ep126,The basement is awesome.
196,ep126,However there's a lot of renovations that have to be done down there and that's just more added cost.
197,ep126,Beautiful. already see Ian with his grill right here.
198,ep126,Nice summertime grilling.
199,ep126,Where would we potentially put a pool?
200,ep126,You got yard behind the garage that you could definitely put a pool.
201,ep126,This would be a cool place to have friends over.
202,ep126,Look at how much space Leo would have to run.
203,ep126,"Oh, he'd love it."
204,ep126,Is that a fire pit?
205,ep126,-That is a fire pit.
206,ep126,-Awesome. backyard space is really great.
207,ep126,I can definitely see space for an above ground pool in the future.
208,ep126,There's a lot of potential here.
209,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
210,ep126,I think the house is so cute.
211,ep126,I love blue.
212,ep126,Blue is actually my favorite color.
213,ep126,"It's not open concept but it's really nice, plus a, um, basement also is great band practice space, too."
214,ep126,Yeah. kitchen's doable.
215,ep126,I'll say there's some tight spaces in here.
216,ep126,It's just a little cramped for me.
217,ep126,So Todd finds a bigger home where Ian's not so confined.
218,ep126,If only Dawn can get past the price.
219,ep126,"It is $399,000 and that just does not make me comfortable at all."
220,ep126,"-It's under $400,000."
221,ep126,"-That was the rule, right?"
222,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
223,ep126,We're under the gun here.
224,ep126,You know what I mean?
225,ep126,"Like, we have to find something."
226,ep126,"Not wanting to stay in their cramped Boston apartment, Dawn and Ian are scrambling to find a house in Jersey that will work for both of them."
227,ep126,Something roomy for him that won't break the bank for her.
228,ep126,"Four bedrooms, so I know you'll like that."
229,ep126,-Yeah. and that just does not make me comfortable at all.
230,ep126,"-It's under $400,000."
231,ep126,"-Really? was the rule, right?"
232,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
233,ep126,-I love the color.
234,ep126,-Cherry blossom tree?
235,ep126,Nice. Todd.
236,ep126,"Hey guys, it's a beautiful day to look at a beautiful house."
237,ep126,"-Yeah. know Ian wanted a ranch, but right now in this competitive market, there's not a lot of ranches for sale so I'm kind of limited to showing him some Capes."
238,ep126,But this house does have an open floor plan.
239,ep126,He also gets his chef's kitchen.
240,ep126,"$399,000 is the top of the range."
241,ep126,I know Ian will be okay with that but I'm not too sure about Dawn.
242,ep126,"So, you get a nice size living room here."
243,ep126,-It's really open.
244,ep126,-It's nice.
245,ep126,I like it.
246,ep126,"-Yeah. $399,000, -we should like it."
247,ep126,"-Okay. is your open concept and Ian, your beautiful kitchen that..."
248,ep126,-I see that.
249,ep126,-...you serve out of.
250,ep126,"I see that, okay."
251,ep126,Open concept opens right up into this.
252,ep126,He's gonna right for the kitchen.
253,ep126,"Oh, this is great."
254,ep126,The appliances are perfect.
255,ep126,-Gas stove.
256,ep126,"Okay. all look really new, well-taken care off."
257,ep126,"But having this island where I can serve food, -this is perfect."
258,ep126,Right? I can be hanging out in the living room.
259,ep126,And still have a conversation while you're preparing everything.
260,ep126,"Perfect. the front, there's a bathroom."
261,ep126,I didn't realize that walking in that this was the bathroom.
262,ep126,"-The bathroom, right."
263,ep126,"-See? can wash my chest, but I mean I have to do this."
264,ep126,Right. can have a plumber come take a look at it and get some prices.
265,ep126,"And let me guess, you got a guy?"
266,ep126,I got a guy.
267,ep126,"-Look, we don't have the extra cash flow for renovations at $399,000, that's the issue."
268,ep126,-Right. you also have two bedrooms down here.
269,ep126,Okay. is nice.
270,ep126,"For now, it could be the guest bedroom and then maybe in the future if we adopt."
271,ep126,"Yeah, I think we use this for the kids in the future."
272,ep126,Here's the smaller bedroom on a lower level.
273,ep126,"So, this could be like a good office for you."
274,ep126,This is perfect.
275,ep126,This is a great office space.
276,ep126,[dramatic music playing]
277,ep126,"I love this, this little nook in here."
278,ep126,"Oh, yeah."
279,ep126,"Oh, this is nice."
280,ep126,Plus it doesn't feel closed off for a Cape Cod.
281,ep126,"We could make the main bedroom up here, couldn't we?"
282,ep126,"Yeah, this is a Cape."
283,ep126,You could.
284,ep126,You have a half a bath also.
285,ep126,"Oh, yeah."
286,ep126,Can you fit?
287,ep126,"-Uh, kind of."
288,ep126,-[Dawn laughs]
289,ep126,"I mean can deal with the ceiling if this is just, you know, the half bath."
290,ep126,-Right. more that the main bath is not up to par.
291,ep126,We still have another room.
292,ep126,"-Watch your head, Ian."
293,ep126,"This is a good size room, too."
294,ep126,Wow. the rooms are really good size.
295,ep126,"If that was the main bedroom, this could be the glam room."
296,ep126,-Yeah. you go.
297,ep126,See? bedrooms all of a sudden works.
298,ep126,"Okay. see what you're doing, but the price."
299,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
300,ep126,-It is a fenced in yard.
301,ep126,-That'll be good for Leo.
302,ep126,You got a nice patio area here.
303,ep126,"Finding a room for, uh, grills, -having people over."
304,ep126,-Yup. guessing this is plenty of room for your pool.
305,ep126,"Oh, yeah, definitely."
306,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
307,ep126,I can definitely envision myself in this house.
308,ep126,The house has four bedrooms and this awesome big kitchen and the price to me is good.
309,ep126,"There's no basement, right?"
310,ep126,This house does not have a basement.
311,ep126,"So, where would we have room for the band space?"
312,ep126,"There's no garage, there's no basement."
313,ep126,-That could be a problem.
314,ep126,-Right. was kind of one of our things that we really wanted to get.
315,ep126,"Being in a one-bedroom apartment, we haven't been able to play our instruments as loudly as we would like to."
316,ep126,"You would have to consolidate one of the rooms, -you know, so."
317,ep126,-Right. in the living room.
318,ep126,-Yeah. option in the future might an addition.
319,ep126,That's really disappointing.
320,ep126,That's something we're really gonna have to think about.
321,ep126,So Todd finds another option with an attached garage that's ideal for jamming and there's another perk.
322,ep126,They look like beach houses.
323,ep126,We are five minutes from the beach.
324,ep126,-Oh. which...
325,ep126,Okay. much like that.
326,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
327,ep126,Houses are really close together but I mean it's cute.
328,ep126,They look like beach houses.
329,ep126,We are five minutes from the beach.
330,ep126,-Oh. which...
331,ep126,-Okay. much like that.
332,ep126,"So, the listing that Todd sent us, it's $359,999."
333,ep126,"-You like that, huh?"
334,ep126,"-Yes, but it's one bath."
335,ep126,"-Oh. under the gun here, so if that's what it is, that's what is."
336,ep126,"Oh, it looks small, doesn't it?"
337,ep126,It does look small.
338,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
339,ep126,"The house is newly renovated, you get a pool, a deck, a detached garage and it has a beautiful kitchen for Ian."
340,ep126,You get a lot for your money here.
341,ep126,I think they're gonna like it.
342,ep126,"Oh, my gosh."
343,ep126,"Wow, I dig it."
344,ep126,I mean it's small but it's really nice.
345,ep126,I love it.
346,ep126,I love those walls.
347,ep126,"We grew up going to the ocean a lot as a kid so, like, this kind of stuff is, uh, very nostalgic for me."
348,ep126,What's that door in the floor?
349,ep126,That is actually a trapdoor to the crawlspace -so no basement...
350,ep126,"-Okay. you get too anxious, I have a nice two-car garage in the back..."
351,ep126,Okay. of jam space.
352,ep126,Okay. my gosh.
353,ep126,"This is what I'm talking about, Todd."
354,ep126,Look at all this space.
355,ep126,"Gas stove, all the appliances look really nice."
356,ep126,It doesn't have an island but it has this.
357,ep126,-Love it.
358,ep126,-This is the serving area.
359,ep126,"So, when you're cooking out here, I could still be hanging out in the living and have a conversation with you."
360,ep126,This is perfect.
361,ep126,Let's head over to the bedrooms.
362,ep126,Okay. this is small and these floors look a bit old.
363,ep126,-These can be refinished.
364,ep126,Okay. do have a guy that refinishes floors.
365,ep126,Todd's got a guy.
366,ep126,-You do.
367,ep126,"Let's see if, uh, Ian can take a shower -in this house."
368,ep126,"Oh, this looks nice."
369,ep126,Main bathroom.
370,ep126,"Oh, okay."
371,ep126,It looks...
372,ep126,-That looks high enough.
373,ep126,-Yeah. it's definitely high enough.
374,ep126,And it's the only bathroom but it's redone and you fit in the shower so this could work.
375,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
376,ep126,So. this is cool.
377,ep126,Is this considered a bedroom?
378,ep126,This is a loft so you still have another bedroom.
379,ep126,Oh. like this.
380,ep126,This is what I see as the main bedroom.
381,ep126,Mmm-hmm. then the glam room is on the other side definitely.
382,ep126,"And it doesn't feel cramped in here for a Cape, right?"
383,ep126,"No, not at all."
384,ep126,We can put a king size bed in here.
385,ep126,[upbeat music playing]
386,ep126,I wanna show you the laundry room.
387,ep126,"Oh, cool."
388,ep126,I know you guys were disappointed about only one bathroom.
389,ep126,This is a good space to add a second bath.
390,ep126,"Yeah, a half bath could easily fit in here."
391,ep126,"Wow, a pool."
392,ep126,I was not expecting that at all.
393,ep126,-That was a surprise pool.
394,ep126,I like this a lot.
395,ep126,This could be my outside grilling area.
396,ep126,-The whole area.
397,ep126,-The whole area.
398,ep126,This is a good size.
399,ep126,I'm cool with this.
400,ep126,I definitely can see myself using that pool a lot.
401,ep126,Especially because the grill area is right next to it so I could totally be hanging out in the pool while Ian's preparing the meal.
402,ep126,Over here is your jam space.
403,ep126,"Oh, wow."
404,ep126,This is a good space.
405,ep126,"There's electric in here, too."
406,ep126,"So, we can plug in and rock."
407,ep126,-Yeah. -Yeah.
408,ep126,[rock music playing]
409,ep126,I really like it.
410,ep126,That kitchen blew my mind.
411,ep126,"I really liked the upstairs, too, because you can kind of make it a whole main suite with the..."
412,ep126,with a glam room.
413,ep126,-And a bonus pool.
414,ep126,I know.
415,ep126,The thing is there's only one bathroom.
416,ep126,"And we would have to put more money into it, so..."
417,ep126,"Added expense, I know."
418,ep126,You don't have much time especially on this house.
419,ep126,"-Right. this price, you're gonna have a lot more offers than just yours."
420,ep126,-Yeah. is the most stressful thing I've ever done.
421,ep126,We have to make a decision now or we're gonna have to re-sign a lease.
422,ep126,"I understand that in our price range, we're not gonna get everything that we want."
423,ep126,"So, that just makes it even harder to make a decision because I don't know what to give up."
424,ep126,[rock music playing]
425,ep126,"If we don't make a decision this weekend, then we're gonna be stuck in a lease for another year."
426,ep126,Yeah. Dawn and Ian are under pressure to buy their first home in Jersey's tight market.
427,ep126,No home's been perfect so now it's a matter of figuring out a compromise.
428,ep126,"What did you think about the cape that was $379,000?"
429,ep126,The kitchen left a bit to be desired.
430,ep126,I'd like more counter space.
431,ep126,Plus it's not that open concept that I really wanted.
432,ep126,The bathroom was fully renovated.
433,ep126,It wasn't my favorite.
434,ep126,The toilet right next to the vanity...
435,ep126,That's right.
436,ep126,-...that a little awkward.
437,ep126,"The second bedroom upstairs, I could definitely see that as a glam room."
438,ep126,We've got that basement for me to put my office down there or a band space.
439,ep126,It's not finished yet...
440,ep126,But it's already at the top of what I'm comfortable spending and that's just another added cost.
441,ep126,That's the compromise there.
442,ep126,"That cape that came in at $399,000, I do like that there are four bedrooms and that's the kind of kitchen layout that's great."
443,ep126,-A great cooking space...
444,ep126,Mmm-hmm. loved the open layout.
445,ep126,"However, that bathroom was a bit cramped."
446,ep126,"The showerhead comes up to my chest which, you know, is less than ideal."
447,ep126,"Another major downer, there's no garage, there's no basement."
448,ep126,Where would we practice?
449,ep126,Maybe in the living room.
450,ep126,It's better than nothing.
451,ep126,"Okay. do you think about the Cape that came in at $359,999?"
452,ep126,I was not expecting that pool at all.
453,ep126,"And the garage is definitely a good, you know, band space."
454,ep126,The kitchen has everything I want.
455,ep126,The appliances were all brand new.
456,ep126,There's tons of counter space.
457,ep126,The bathroom looks really nice.
458,ep126,But it's also the only bathroom.
459,ep126,That's true.
460,ep126,And the price is really good.
461,ep126,"However, Todd did say that we might have to bid higher on it."
462,ep126,We're out of time so we're gonna have to compromise somewhere.
463,ep126,Nothing's gonna be perfect.
464,ep126,[dramatic music playing]
465,ep126,[doorbell rings]
466,ep126,"Oh, you like this yard?"
467,ep126,We decided to go with the Cape that had the huge basement.
468,ep126,The deciding factor was the basement.
469,ep126,We can play music down there anytime we want.
470,ep126,Plus that doubles our living space.
471,ep126,"Basement's unfinished so for now, my office will be in the dining room."
472,ep126,"That's what we have to do for a couple of months then, you know, it's not that big of a deal."
473,ep126,"The house was listed at $379,000 and we purchased at $380,000."
474,ep126,"In this market right now, to get really close to the list price was awesome."
475,ep126,We can just hang out back here.
476,ep126,"There's a lot of privacy, too."
477,ep126,I love the backyard in this house.
478,ep126,There's plenty of room for a pool in the future.
479,ep126,-It's great for Leo.
480,ep126,-He never had that before.
481,ep126,It's a whole new world for him.
482,ep126,Look at the way he flops.
483,ep126,We moved in just a few days ago and my glam room is coming along very nicely.
484,ep126,Major thing that we compromised on is it doesn't have that open concept.
485,ep126,Also I would really have preferred that the half bath was already finished but at least we have a second toilet so it's a place that we can start.
486,ep126,The kitchen wasn't my favorite of all the houses we looked at.
487,ep126,But it'll do the job and that what's important.
488,ep126,Let's check out the acoustics.
489,ep126,"I'm excited about playing music, starting a project."
490,ep126,We definitely wanna start a band with friends that live nearby.
491,ep126,-[violin music playing]
492,ep126,-[guitar music playing]
493,ep126,"Having a space for we can have our friends over, sit down, write some music, that's never been a reality and now it is."
494,ep126,"Eventually, we could talk about adopting children in the future."
495,ep126,I would love to have our own family band and then...
496,ep126,Are we gonna adopt bass players?
497,ep126,Sure. a drummer.
1,ep127,My mother needs.
2,ep127,really instilled in us wants versus finances.
3,ep127,Your mom's a smart woman but she doesn't control my price.
4,ep127,Chris and Lamar are moving from New York to DC and are in town to hunt but they can't agree on future.
5,ep127,"Lamar wants to spend low, thinking of their kids."
6,ep127,"I'm gonna establish generational wealth, I want to give that to our now."
7,ep127,Chris is ready to max out on a luxurious home want.
8,ep127,This is finally the spa-like bathroom I compromise.
9,ep127,"With only a month to buy before Lamar starts grad school, there's not much time to high."
10,ep127,"I'm already falling in love, but the price is kinda too life."
11,ep127,Lamar is the cheapest person I've ever met in my term.
12,ep127,I think cheap is the wrong rings]
13,ep127,-[doorbell playing]
14,ep127,-[upbeat music playing]
15,ep127,[upbeat music sad.
16,ep127,"I really can't believe that we're gonna be moving out of New York, like, my home -and, uh, it's gonna be right?"
17,ep127,"-I know, family."
18,ep127,But it's really nice because we're gonna be a lot closer to your homes.
19,ep127,Thank God we just have your sister's place to hang out for a little bit while we're looking for these firm.
20,ep127,"I'm Lamar, I'm 29 years old and I'm a digital strategist for a financial service author."
21,ep127,"And I'm Chris, I'm 27, I'm a political journalist and years."
22,ep127,-We've been together for seven years.
23,ep127,-Seven Maryland.
24,ep127,We met at the university in year.
25,ep127,"My first year, we didn't start dating -until my last history."
26,ep127,Yes. the rest is resist.
27,ep127,You couldn't resist.
28,ep127,"-I couldn't resist, you couldn't resist."
29,ep127,-You couldn't 10.
30,ep127,"We're moving to DC because I'm going to Georgetown University, plus I'm going to be very close to my family, I have a big family, I'm one of family."
31,ep127,We're gonna be a whole lot closer to your family.
32,ep127,-Mmm-hmm. is amazing because I'm kind of gaining a second quickly.
33,ep127,Classes start pretty soon so the pressure's on for us to find something pretty week.
34,ep127,"So since this is our third time down here from New York, our lease is ending soon, so I would prefer to find a place this bacon."
35,ep127,"Definitely. it was up to you, this brunch would consist of three eggs -and two pieces of brunch."
36,ep127,"-Well, we don't need to have shrimp, salmon, avocados, the whole works just to have a life."
37,ep127,Lamar is the cheapest person I've ever met in my term.
38,ep127,I think cheap is the wrong right.
39,ep127,I know how to spend my money up.
40,ep127,"I'm gonna establish generational wealth, you know, I didn't had that big of a financial background growing them."
41,ep127,I want to give that to our kids when we have rent.
42,ep127,We're looking at this as our starter home and build equity and I didn't wanna go another year wasting on mimosas.
43,ep127,-These are our good luck occasion?
44,ep127,-What's the careful.
45,ep127,So be house.
46,ep127,"Just some good luck in order to find a $600,000."
47,ep127,We got approved for much.
48,ep127,"But I don't wanna spend that $450,000."
49,ep127,I would love to spend poor.
50,ep127,Anything above that would make us house want.
51,ep127,I think that you have to spend to get what you else?
52,ep127,-What but...
53,ep127,"-I would prefer it to be, like, in Northwest, so it's not too far away -from Georgetown city."
54,ep127,-Yeah. definitely gonna need to find metro-accessible but I love being a little removed from the work.
55,ep127,"I really enjoy having a little oasis, kind of getaway from the city, something to escape to after a long day of homes?"
56,ep127,"Have you only been looking at, like, townhomes or single-family well."
57,ep127,"Yeah. we mostly looked at townhomes, semi-detached homes, but now we're looking at condos as privacy."
58,ep127,"Yeah. don't know if I wanna live in a condo, honestly, like, I prefer having a little bit more spaces."
59,ep127,I love modern open concept minimum.
60,ep127,"Ideally two bedrooms, two bath, know."
61,ep127,"-With an office, you that."
62,ep127,-Can't go less than bathroom.
63,ep127,"-Yes. want walk-in closets, spa luxury."
64,ep127,I just want everything to feel very modern and modest.
65,ep127,I'd rather be luxury.
66,ep127,I would prefer terrible.
67,ep127,What we currently have is pretty nice but the neighbors are just space.
68,ep127,"We can hear them playing basketball above our bedroom at night, we need to have a big backyard around."
69,ep127,I love to garden and for this guy who need some space to run rooftop.
70,ep127,Yeah. would love a list.
71,ep127,-It's definitely on the top of my drinks.
72,ep127,Yeah. have this vision of having people over and being able to go out on our rooftop and have some it.
73,ep127,"Yeah. live in a city, so might as well take full advantage of stars."
74,ep127,"I would like to go up there after long days of work, have a drink, and just look up at the future."
75,ep127,-Compromise. is gonna be -a big word for the word.
76,ep127,"-Compromise. big, big years?"
77,ep127,You haven't done that -after seven learning.
78,ep127,-We're still stubborn.
79,ep127,-We're both learning.
80,ep127,-Still playing]
81,ep127,"[upbeat music $449,000."
82,ep127,"Since this is their last trip to DC before school starts, today their agent, Kirby, is meeting them at a place that could quickly sell Lamar, a two-bedroom penthouse in the city with a rooftop deck and a low price, needs."
83,ep127,My mother really instilled in us wants versus finances.
84,ep127,Your mom's a smart woman but she doesn't control my laughs]
85,ep127,-[Lamar Kirby.
86,ep127,"-Hey, wrong."
87,ep127,"So I just got to the place that I wanted to show you guys today and I realized -that the listing was $519,000."
88,ep127,"-Oh. two-bedroom is actually not a penthouse, it's a ground floor unit, there is no outdoor space, and that one's $449,000."
89,ep127,"The penthouse is just a one-bedroom, that one's only both?"
90,ep127,-Maybe we could check out both.
91,ep127,-Yeah. we can definitely check out point.
92,ep127,"First time home buyers can be a little unrealistic, they think that they're gonna get everything and get it at a certain price it."
93,ep127,Lamar is wanting to stay under a certain price whereas Chris is ready to ball out on want.
94,ep127,So my challenge today is to show them the value in spending a little bit more money so that you can get what you playing]
95,ep127,[upbeat music first.
96,ep127,"This is the ground floor unit that has two bedrooms, but I'm gonna take you guys to the penthouse wow."
97,ep127,Okay. rooftop.
98,ep127,"Brand new construction, this is a one-bedroom penthouse, there is a okay."
99,ep127,"I like that, penthouse."
100,ep127,"See, this is a yeah."
101,ep127,"-High ceilings, closely..."
102,ep127,"-And I mean, -if you listen nothing."
103,ep127,Yeah. hardware.
104,ep127,"Nothing. white kitchen, black cramped."
105,ep127,"Beautiful. is set up really nicely, I like it but it's kind of room."
106,ep127,It does feel a little more like a hallway -than an actual living footage?
107,ep127,Yeah. the square feet.
108,ep127,700 square me.
109,ep127,700 square feet is kind of scaring bathroom?
110,ep127,"So there's one bathroom on this floor, is this the only floor."
111,ep127,One bathroom on this small.
112,ep127,This is pretty energy.
113,ep127,Yeah. it's still giving me spa enough?
114,ep127,Are you gonna flush the toilet or does this feel modern terrible.
115,ep127,"Oh, laughs]"
116,ep127,-[Chris pressure.
117,ep127,"My childhood home, we didn't have that strong of a water me."
118,ep127,Okay. definitely top priority for that.
119,ep127,"Well, it's new construction, we can definitely work on perfect."
120,ep127,Lamar has this weird thing where he needs to make sure the water pressure is situation?
121,ep127,"I'm also thinking about a lot more, like, turnkey style apartment, what is this place giving us, what's the privacy on."
122,ep127,Come floor.
123,ep127,"Okay. it's two floors but for Chester, it's one right."
124,ep127,-Yeah. all you.
125,ep127,"Come on Chester, I got right."
126,ep127,All though.
127,ep127,I love the spiral staircases nice?
128,ep127,Isn't it bedroom?
129,ep127,And this is the only bedroom.
130,ep127,This is the only light.
131,ep127,I'm loving the natural that.
132,ep127,I do like here?
133,ep127,Could we fit our king-size mattress in tight.
134,ep127,-It's gonna be lifestyle.
135,ep127,-Yeah. you guys can adapt to a minimalist it.
136,ep127,We could work with playing]
137,ep127,[upbeat music nice.
138,ep127,Wow. is right?
139,ep127,"I could definitely set up a garden space over here and this is just ours, this."
140,ep127,"Just your rooftop, no one else in the building -can access rooftop."
141,ep127,-A private nice.
142,ep127,That's pretty playing]
143,ep127,[upbeat music okay.
144,ep127,"Oh, rooftop."
145,ep127,I love the private office.
146,ep127,I do love the rooftop but I do not see a place where I could put my two-bedroom.
147,ep127,Why don't we go take a look at the nice.
148,ep127,Okay. this is upstairs.
149,ep127,Way bigger than okay?
150,ep127,"Yeah. one's a thousand square feet, here."
151,ep127,Can definitely picture having some people over or having a nice little dinner high.
152,ep127,Yeah. the price is kind of too concept.
153,ep127,"The kitchen's really nice, I like the open yourself."
154,ep127,"Mmm-hmm. the bedrooms are unique because they're downstairs and what's cool about that is you're not living underneath anyone, you're living underneath noise."
155,ep127,So the noise that you hear is gonna be your own that.
156,ep127,I like bedroom.
157,ep127,-This is the bigger bedroom.
158,ep127,The larger here.
159,ep127,Okay. think that your king-size bed -could fit in here.
160,ep127,-It could definitely fit in upstairs.
161,ep127,It's a lot less cramped than for.
162,ep127,This is what we've been asking backyard.
163,ep127,Right. only problem is no okay.
164,ep127,"Wow, want."
165,ep127,Okay. is finally the spa-like bathroom I be.
166,ep127,I knew it would amazing.
167,ep127,"I love this type of custom door, this is office."
168,ep127,And then Lamar's weird.
169,ep127,The lack of windows is kind of space.
170,ep127,I really cannot see that being a really nice office sunlight.
171,ep127,I could work there but I like the privacy.
172,ep127,The pros about this unit is that there are two bedrooms and tons of space.
173,ep127,The con is that we don't have any of our own backyard upstairs.
174,ep127,Yeah. really love the fact that you have your own private rooftop that.
175,ep127,I love feet.
176,ep127,"-Tons of privacy and it's really, really nice, but on the other hand, it's only like 700 square space."
177,ep127,"Yeah. worried about that, like, I need an office condo?"
178,ep127,Is there any way that we can just buy both of these units and then just turn it into one big perfect.
179,ep127,That would be playing]
180,ep127,[upbeat music action.
181,ep127,"So Kirby shows them a place with just about everything, including outdoor space, but it means buying in an area that's still up and coming and a little far from the this."
182,ep127,"If we're gonna be spending what you wanna spend, we may have to look in a neighborhood like place."
183,ep127,The inside has to blow me away in order for me to say yes to this playing]
184,ep127,[upbeat music Lamar.
185,ep127,Chris and Lamar are feeling pressured to quickly find a place in their new hometown that's lux for Chris but affordable for out.
186,ep127,"Their agent's lined up a two-bedroom townhome, but it's a little farther cost?"
187,ep127,"I'm really excited, a nice big townhouse and a new property, how much did Kirby say this place this."
188,ep127,"-$450,000. neighborhood is not exactly what I'm thinking we would live in but if we're gonna be spending what you wanna spend, we may have to look in a neighborhood like playing]"
189,ep127,[upbeat music is.
190,ep127,Took a little bit of time to get here but look at how nice it door.
191,ep127,"-Yeah, I like the red page."
192,ep127,-Yeah? and Chris are struggling to stay on the same place.
193,ep127,"So today with Chris, I'm just gonna show him all the bells and whistles of this important."
194,ep127,"With Lamar, investment potential is very that."
195,ep127,So the property that I'm gonna show them is right in line with years.
196,ep127,"The neighborhood of Congress Heights has seen growth every year, so that's only gonna mean more money in their pockets, this is exactly how you build generational wealth by coming to those areas that are less desirable, getting in at a great price and building equity over the me."
197,ep127,"The only reason I'm here is because of the price, the location's not doing it for place."
198,ep127,The inside has to blow me away in order for me to say yes to this plan.
199,ep127,Open floor this.
200,ep127,Look at kitchen.
201,ep127,I'm already falling in love with this wow.
202,ep127,"Oh, beautiful?"
203,ep127,Isn't this kitchen dreams.
204,ep127,The island of my for.
205,ep127,"I love it and look at the white kitchen, open concept, we could have so many people here to entertain, it's definitely giving me that luxury vibe -we're looking it."
206,ep127,"Yeah, I knew floor?"
207,ep127,Is this the top you.
208,ep127,"So it's not the top floor, -there is someone above finishes."
209,ep127,-Okay. that's the tradeoff for having that wonderful price point and all these luxury this?
210,ep127,What is up?
211,ep127,Is this all gonna be fixed balcony.
212,ep127,"So it's gonna be a small little, like, railing, it's not gonna be a full-on modern."
213,ep127,This is really nice and this.
214,ep127,Mmm-hmm. I really like tones.
215,ep127,"Lots of mixtures of textures, and bright."
216,ep127,"Over here, you have your first bedroom, nice and working."
217,ep127,"I could turn this into an office, I like the window space here, a lot of natural light when I'm suite."
218,ep127,You could practically live here and then I can take the owner's bathroom.
219,ep127,This is the guest nice.
220,ep127,"Oh, this is really, really, really pressure."
221,ep127,-Chris... saw you trying to check the water construction.
222,ep127,It's not on right now because it's new suite.
223,ep127,Come on over to the owner's bedroom.
224,ep127,-Nice size out.
225,ep127,Okay. you can walk out and just let Chester Chris]
226,ep127,-[Lamar and there.
227,ep127,"Wow. little backyard space, you can put a garden bit."
228,ep127,I see that tail wagging a little bathroom.
229,ep127,Over here is another spa-inspired here.
230,ep127,I love the light fixtures and how modern everything feels in shower.
231,ep127,I like the walk-in hotel.
232,ep127,It almost feels like you're in a place.
233,ep127,I have fallen in love with this welcoming.
234,ep127,It feels super inviting and want.
235,ep127,It's giving Lamar that price that he's into and it's giving me that space and privacy -that I really rooms.
236,ep127,I love the bedroom.
237,ep127,I can see my office being in that second me.

248,ep127,Chris and Lamar are feeling the time crunch as they try to find a balance between the lux life for Chris and a low price for potential.
249,ep127,"Today, they're looking at a home in the city well below their max with good investment possible."
250,ep127,I don't wanna just go into the cheapest place poor.
251,ep127,"I definitely don't want cheap, trying to find a place that doesn't make us house want."
252,ep127,We also need to make sure that we're gonna be happy wherever we end up living and sometimes you need to spend a little more to get what you happy.

264,ep127,"There's two beds, two baths, let's go check it challenging."
265,ep127,"Saving money is top priority for Lamar, I totally understand where Lamar is coming from, I too have been a first time home buyer where I was spending way more than I wanted to, it ended up making my first couple years lifestyle."
266,ep127,So we've got to find that perfect balance of affordability plus door.

305,ep127,-Hmm. definitely wants to save it.
306,ep127,He has a lot of good reasons for want.
307,ep127,"I understand that we're probably gonna have to spend something a bit closer to what he wants, but I just hope that he remembers the things that I backyard."
308,ep127,"To our right, we're gonna head to the wow."
309,ep127,"-Oh, spacious."
310,ep127,-Pretty backyard?
311,ep127,Everyone in this building has access to the access.
312,ep127,Everyone in this building has privacy.
313,ep127,Wow. zero big.
314,ep127,"No privacy, but pretty here?"
315,ep127,Can I garden back right?
316,ep127,"-Probably not, there."
317,ep127,"-Uh, Ches."

322,ep127,"Wow. like a workout to, uh, get up to your rooftop, rooftop."
323,ep127,I love this city.
324,ep127,"I mean, it feels a little bit like an escape from the right?"
325,ep127,"Mmm-hmm. like, it's all over there, love."
326,ep127,"So you kind of are getting out of the city, -which I view."
327,ep127,"-Keep in mind though that this is a shared space, so something you definitely have to get used to, but it is gorgeous and you have a nice little neighborhood."
328,ep127,I love this bathrooms.
329,ep127,"It has two bedrooms, two office."
330,ep127,We could turn that second bedroom into an spaces.
331,ep127,"I know that you wanna save some money but I also wanna make sure that we have everything we want in our house, like, privacy and being able to have our own budging."
332,ep127,"I'm really trying to work with Lamar and his price point, and price range, but for me, I'm starting to get worried that I'm compromising too much and he's really not playing]"
333,ep127,[upbeat music on?
334,ep127,What's going live.
335,ep127,We are trying to finally make a decision on where we're going to space.
336,ep127,Chris and Lamar are relocating from New York City to DC and need to decide if location is more important than luxury and city.
337,ep127,So there are some new construction condos that we checked out right in the heart of the unbeatable.
338,ep127,"We saw the penthouse and we saw the bottom floor, that penthouse gave us a private rooftop, -that's almost amazing."
339,ep127,That sounds bedroom.
340,ep127,"It had really modern architecture and it's really beautiful, but that bedroom that we saw was so small, it was only one yeah."
341,ep127,"-Oh, there."
342,ep127,-I don't think we could fit in me.
343,ep127,That doesn't scream luxury to know.
344,ep127,"Yeah, I situation."
345,ep127,"There was also the condo on the first floor of that building, which was really, really nice and it did have a second bedroom, but no backyard for me, I feel like I'm losing in that garden."
346,ep127,"There was that townhouse a little bit further out from the city center, two floors, two bedrooms, so Lamar can get that office space he wants, and that huge kitchen, and a backyard for Chester and me to center."
347,ep127,It may be the best investment but my issue with it is it's just too far from the city DC.
348,ep127,"There's one that I would like, it's the one in Northwest at $382,000, you cannot beat that in wow."
349,ep127,"Oh, Lamar."
350,ep127,"I know that price tag was just calling your name, was."
351,ep127,It bathrooms.
352,ep127,"And not only that, but it fits our needs, it's two bedrooms, two us."
353,ep127,"It's more like a dorm, neighbors living on top of shared."
354,ep127,"That bathroom was not giving me spa-like vibes, it did have a rooftop but it was neighbors."
355,ep127,"Okay. you never know, you can become friends -with those shared friends."
356,ep127,Yeah. already have plenty of me.
357,ep127,I don't think I need any more with the people that are living in a building with playing]
358,ep127,[upbeat music ringing]
359,ep127,[doorbell walk...
360,ep127,This is the first time we renting.
361,ep127,We're walking to a place we're not Chester?
362,ep127,"-Are you excited, giggles]"
363,ep127,-[Chris excited.
364,ep127,He seems with...
365,ep127,"So after a lot of negotiations and compromise, we went DC."
366,ep127,The affordable two-bedroom condo in downtown DC.
367,ep127,"So it all came down to location and price, $382,000, you cannot beat that in poor."
368,ep127,"If we were gonna spend what I originally wanted to spend, we would've been totally house center."
369,ep127,"And honestly, I realized this is the perfect location because it's downtown DC and I'm right in the heart of the action, but I'm still slightly removed from the city privacy."
370,ep127,So we get a little bit of it.
371,ep127,"Our seller was pretty amazing, she was gonna donate or sell all of this furniture and asked if we wanted any of it."
372,ep127,And we told her we wanted all of in.
373,ep127,It really helps make the process a little bit easier when you already have some chairs and couches moved it?
374,ep127,Wow. like room.
375,ep127,"-I mean, it's not a dorm nice."
376,ep127,"So, yeah, it's a little bit wants."
377,ep127,"Since he let me get the place that was really important to me, to build that generational wealth, I have agreed to let Chris do any renovation that he for."
378,ep127,"See, I am the renovation manager, there is no budget whatsoever, we're not discussing money anymore, I'm just gonna give it that luxury vibe that I'm going down."
379,ep127,We wanna rip up this bar and put some white marble cabinets.
380,ep127,-White here.
381,ep127,-Mmm-hmm. nook over that.
382,ep127,"He wants his spa-like bathroom, so we're gonna give him cost?"
383,ep127,So how much do you think that's gonna that...
384,ep127,I know you guys chose the option cost.
385,ep127,-Don't worry about house.
386,ep127,-Okay. loves this backyard.
387,ep127,He's the king of that actually.
388,ep127,"Exactly. neighbors have been really nice so far, neighbors."
389,ep127,"-Yeah. to my surprise, I don't mind living with DC."

391,ep127,My family comes from DC.
392,ep127,My mother grew up in a segregated owners.
393,ep127,"And now, we're property wedding."

281,ep128,One of the biggest concerns I have for Sara is the amount of maintenance that any home would spaces.
282,ep128,"This one because it is a townhome, does have an HOA that will take care of the outside out."

8,ep129,"Now, it's just a matter of seeing what they can compromise on to score a house in this white-hot market."
9,ep129,-No room.
10,ep129,-Awkward. my head.
11,ep129,This low ceiling right over the toilet where a man needs to stand.
12,ep129,Ah! is happening in here?
13,ep129,I already did yoga and I gotta probably do a HIIT workout and maybe go for a run.
14,ep129,I'm a health coach and this is my boyfriend Josh.
15,ep129,And I'm an artist and we live together in Seattle.
16,ep129,We met about ten years ago -on an online dating website.
17,ep129,I was about 14 months into a Stage IV cancer diagnosis.
18,ep129,I was pretty nervous.
19,ep129,"You know, I don't wanna get into a relationship with someone who's gonna just not be here, you know, within a year or two."
20,ep129,"When she came into the bar for the first time it was like the scene in The Wizard of Oz, where everything was in color."
21,ep129,Like I had been living a black and white life.
22,ep129,Most people with my diagnosis don't survive that long.
23,ep129,But I was enrolled into a research study and just became stabilized.
24,ep129,"So at some point in the past few years, we just decided he is gonna keep living."
25,ep129,-Hmm. we might as well make decisions -as if he is gonna keep living.
26,ep129,-Yeah. have been renting this 700-square-foot apartment and it's just small.
27,ep129,Like there is just not room to grow here.
28,ep129,"We just really felt like, the next step was to just get a house."
29,ep129,We are looking for a house in Tacoma because we can just get more house for the money.
30,ep129,"We are gonna get you a house, kitty."
31,ep129,"-Yeah, if we can finally get an offer accepted."
32,ep129,Yeah. have been pre-approved for 400.
33,ep129,"But with the market the way it is here, we need to look in like the 300 to 350 range because houses are going for 50 to 100,000 over."
34,ep129,We've already been outbid on two houses.
35,ep129,It's just been very discouraging.
36,ep129,It's this feeling of rejection.
37,ep129,That I'm not worthy to get that house.
38,ep129,He takes things a little more personally.
39,ep129,-Hmm. the universe is telling you something.
40,ep129,"Whereas I'm like, ""Let's just move on."""
41,ep129,"You know, craftsmans have all those beautiful accents."
42,ep129,"The molding, I think they are beautifully made."
43,ep129,They are sturdy and a lot of times they are historic.
44,ep129,"Like four to five houses in the area are craftsman and I'm hoping to really like, see a good mid-century house."
45,ep129,It would probably be like a mid-century rambler.
46,ep129,I like that style because my grandmother's house when I grew up was super mid-century.
47,ep129,You love the Formica countertops?
48,ep129,"Huh, the old kitchen."
49,ep129,That was like the Mad Men era.
50,ep129,Whereas I want a beautiful house with amazing sunlight and a perfect backsplash.
51,ep129,I would like room for my office and a guest room.
52,ep129,We need it to have a basement or a garage that's workable to turn into a studio.
53,ep129,I would say that I'm open to doing some renovation projects.
54,ep129,I think it sounds actually like a fun challenge.
55,ep129,"I'm okay getting a house that just needs some small upgrades, like maybe doing a backsplash or painting the wall."
56,ep129,But I don't wanna go into like a huge project.
57,ep129,-I definitely need two bathrooms.
58,ep129,-Mmm-hmm. think that we could be just fine with one bathroom.
59,ep129,"I mean, I'm not gonna let the perfect house go because it doesn't have an extra toilet."
60,ep129,This neighborhood is pretty cute.
61,ep129,But I'm seeing a lots of craftsmans.
62,ep129,Yes. are so cute.
63,ep129,It would be nice to just see one mid-century house mixed in.
64,ep129,Um. it is.
65,ep129,-Wow. is so cute.
66,ep129,It looks just like the pictures.
67,ep129,This is so cute.
68,ep129,Oh my gosh.
69,ep129,Wow. at the porch.
70,ep129,It's absolutely adorable.
71,ep129,"Working with Laura and Josh, Laura being an older friend of mine, um, the strategy is making sure that I'm showing them my professional hat but also wearing the hat as a counselor."
72,ep129,"Especially in the market that we are in, they have already lost out on two homes."
73,ep129,Just making sure that I help Laura stay grounded and helping Josh to be optimistic about the property and that he can afford it.
74,ep129,This is known as the Hilltop neighborhood.
75,ep129,Hmm. on a clear day we'd be able to see beautiful Mount Rainier off to the distance there.
76,ep129,"Awesome. that view is as good as you say, then this house is probably gonna get bid out of our price range."
77,ep129,We have room to go up from 330.
78,ep129,[door creaks]
79,ep129,"Wow. color is um, reminds me of a nursery."
80,ep129,It's a bit blue.
81,ep129,"Yeah, we'll just paint it."
82,ep129,I really love the wood around the windows.
83,ep129,"What do you think, Josh?"
84,ep129,It's definitely like the tallest ceilings that we've seen so far.
85,ep129,[Laura gasps]
86,ep129,Look at this huge kitchen.
87,ep129,Look at this big island.
88,ep129,Okay. like this beadboard ceiling.
89,ep129,But I think it looks a little 2010.
90,ep129,I would update this kitchen.
91,ep129,I'd give the cabinets a color and then a different backsplash.
92,ep129,It's nice to have granite.
93,ep129,I prefer white.
94,ep129,"I'd say probably about $10,000 to switch out the countertops and backsplash."
95,ep129,Okay. that would not be a priority then.
96,ep129,There is a full bath on this floor.
97,ep129,You gotta wonder what a two-bathroom house like this is gonna do -to all of the offers that are gonna come in.
98,ep129,-[Laura gasping]
99,ep129,Clawfoot tub.
100,ep129,"I mean, you suppose this house is gonna get bid up?"
101,ep129,I'm sure it will be.
102,ep129,Mmm-hmm. high do you think?
103,ep129,"I'd guess, probably to about 400,000."
104,ep129,"I mean, it looks worth it, but I'm a little worried about the competition is all."
105,ep129,I'm a little worried about getting my heart hurt again from the earlier rejections that we had on previous houses.
106,ep129,This is nice big yard.
107,ep129,Detached garage.
108,ep129,All right.
109,ep129,Head on in.
110,ep129,Let's check it out.
111,ep129,This is definitely workable.
112,ep129,What do you think you'd have to do to turn this into an art studio?
113,ep129,I'd have to raise the floor up so that it's all level and even.
114,ep129,And then insulation and drywall and ceiling paneling.
115,ep129,All something you can do by yourself.
116,ep129,Yeah. say you could probably do it on a dime.
117,ep129,Mmm-hmm. I'd be willing to at least try that.
118,ep129,-[Laura laughs]
119,ep129,Do you have one dime saved up?
120,ep129,Possibly under a thousand...
121,ep129,-[all laughing]
122,ep129,Let's head on up.
123,ep129,-Cute little stairs.
124,ep129,A staircase that thinks it might be a ladder.
125,ep129,[both laughing]
126,ep129,Okay. don't know if it will be workable as a guest room because it's so small.
127,ep129,It could work if you hate your guests.
128,ep129,[both laugh]
129,ep129,If you have a small guest.
130,ep129,[Laura gasping]
131,ep129,Cute. like the color.
132,ep129,"If we put a bed in here, there's gonna be like a permanent grease -smear right here, from when my-- From your head."
133,ep129,From where my head hits it.
134,ep129,This could make a cool office.
135,ep129,You can put a pullout sofa so it can be an office and a bedroom.
136,ep129,Yeah. you're thinking.
137,ep129,Yeah. bathroom.
138,ep129,Second bathroom.
139,ep129,"-Oh, boy."
140,ep129,-[Laura laughing]
141,ep129,"Oh, no."
142,ep129,This is low.
143,ep129,What a tiny little doorway.
144,ep129,Watch out.
145,ep129,"Well, this is definitely a mark against this house is the this low ceiling right over the toilet where -a man needs to stand."
146,ep129,-[Laura laughs]
147,ep129,Josh is tall and it might be a little hard to use the toilet standing up.
148,ep129,"However, there is a second bathroom."
149,ep129,So there you go.
150,ep129,Problem solved.
151,ep129,I think it's adorable.
152,ep129,I love it.
153,ep129,"Honestly, I love the porch."
154,ep129,I love the yard.
155,ep129,"It's a very beautiful home, you know?"
156,ep129,Yeah. garage looks like it's gonna be a possibility to work as an art studio.
157,ep129,It's priced suspiciously low and it makes me wonder if this house is just gonna turn into a bidding war.
158,ep129,I just don't know if I'm ready for another heartbreak.
159,ep129,"I kinda feel like I maybe want to hold out, maybe see what else is out in the market."
160,ep129,"I'd like to see some, something mid-century maybe-- -Why don't you guys talk about it, get back to me?"
161,ep129,Okay. I'll try and find another maybe mid-century that we can take a look at.
162,ep129,-Okay. all right.
163,ep129,Yvette delivers on the mid-century ranch Josh wants.
164,ep129,But they will have to be open minded.
165,ep129,"Three-bedroom, one bath ranch."
166,ep129,Mmm-mmm. than one bath would be preferable.
167,ep129,"This place is a three-bedroom, one bath ranch -home."
168,ep129,-Mmm-mmm. than one bath would be preferable.
169,ep129,"A one bathroom though, I mean, that's gonna make this house a little bit less competitive."
170,ep129,"Having been outbid twice in Tacoma's busy market, Josh and Laura are trying to find a house where they might have a more competitive edge."
171,ep129,So their broker has lined up a home she thinks has a lot of potential and is within their reach.
172,ep129,It's on the left.
173,ep129,Okay. okay.
174,ep129,This looks kinda mid-century.
175,ep129,Two car garage.
176,ep129,-Mid-cent. the way home.
177,ep129,-Hmm. I like that brick in the front.
178,ep129,-That's a nice touch.
179,ep129,-Yeah. nice to see something other than a craftsman for a change.
180,ep129,"Yeah, well, I prefer craftsman."
181,ep129,It's a little over 1500 square feet.
182,ep129,The lot is large.
183,ep129,"It's a little over 10,000 square feet."
184,ep129,The house is listed at 375.
185,ep129,-Okay. it's a little high.
186,ep129,-Okay. high.
187,ep129,It needs a lot of updates.
188,ep129,So that's the reason why it might not get bid up too high.
189,ep129,Awesome. right.
190,ep129,Mmm. I like how you can see all the way back into that room back there.
191,ep129,I hate this carpet.
192,ep129,"Yeah, this carpet is pretty bad."
193,ep129,But what do you think of this red chevron?
194,ep129,Yeah. 60s.
195,ep129,That is pretty cool.
196,ep129,-I really like that.
197,ep129,Yeah. a cool design.
198,ep129,Watch your step.
199,ep129,It looks like they did some -new flooring on top of vinyl.
200,ep129,"Yeah. you took this wood out, this kitchen would look a little bit more like that mid-century, old kitchen look."
201,ep129,"Yeah. is the type of person who will be like, ""Let's rip up this hardwood and see if there is some ugly linoleum."""
202,ep129,[all laughing]
203,ep129,Exactly. kitchen isn't giving me warm fuzzies.
204,ep129,It's like it doesn't look fresh but not in the old way that I was hoping.
205,ep129,You know what I mean?
206,ep129,Mmm-hmm. I do like this half of the kitchen.
207,ep129,Let's peak on really quickly into the garage.
208,ep129,"I wouldn't need to do very much in here, to get it up and running as a studio."
209,ep129,"So yeah, this they added on when they moved into the home."
210,ep129,"With two living rooms like this, this could be like a pool table."
211,ep129,Something like that.
212,ep129,"Gosh, yes."
213,ep129,So it's cool that they added on and yet didn't like put in another bathroom.
214,ep129,Right. it wouldn't be too expensive to add a bathroom.
215,ep129,"Like... 10,000."
216,ep129,Oh. would add value to the house for sure.
217,ep129,Probably over time.
218,ep129,"-You know, 50 to 100,000."
219,ep129,-There you go.
220,ep129,"Well, let's head on outside."
221,ep129,Okay. okay.
222,ep129,What do you think?
223,ep129,This is a good sized deck.
224,ep129,This is my favorite part so far.
225,ep129,Roof looks good from back here.
226,ep129,"Yeah, the roof is newer."
227,ep129,The gutters are newer.
228,ep129,This is an old bathroom here.
229,ep129,Yeah. like old in the non-charming way.
230,ep129,-Mmm-hmm. ho.
231,ep129,-[Josh laughing]
232,ep129,What is happening in here?
233,ep129,"Yeah, that's pretty gross."
234,ep129,"So for the one bathroom for the house, -it does not have a lot going for it."
235,ep129,-[Josh laughs]
236,ep129,-Let's head on into one of three bedrooms.
237,ep129,-Okay. do you think of this paint?
238,ep129,This color scheme is a bit much.
239,ep129,Yeah. that's easy to change.
240,ep129,Maybe it could be a guest room or-- -Or an office perhaps.
241,ep129,It could be an office.
242,ep129,I'm guessing this would be the main bedroom.
243,ep129,Yes. this is bigger than our current bedroom.
244,ep129,And bedroom three.
245,ep129,Wow. the wallpaper.
246,ep129,Yeah. likely from the 60s.
247,ep129,-[Josh laughs]
248,ep129,"-Well, are you loving it or hating it?"
249,ep129,-I don't know.
250,ep129,"But, lots of potential."
251,ep129,Yeah. removing carpet.
252,ep129,Hardwoods. paint.
253,ep129,I like the yard.
254,ep129,"Uh, everything else, not really great."
255,ep129,I think that it looks like a lot of work to me.
256,ep129,But the potential here is amazing.
257,ep129,It's already kind of getting up there in price.
258,ep129,There likely won't be a lot of offers on this house.
259,ep129,I think that it would likely go maybe 5000 over.
260,ep129,Yeah. here you can put your new paint color.
261,ep129,Maybe rip up carpet.
262,ep129,You can redo kitchen and bathroom -how you want it to look.
263,ep129,"Yeah. you are talking like -20, 30,000 to do all that."
264,ep129,Right? see this as a possibility.
265,ep129,I think Josh is more ready to put in an offer than I am on this house.
266,ep129,I think he just loves that mid-century feel so much.
267,ep129,This house has probably more projects than I think I would wanna take on.
268,ep129,"So now, Yvette has lined up a craftsman she thinks they both might like."
269,ep129,This home was built in 1910.
270,ep129,Wow. there is a little bit of mid-century modern feel to it.
271,ep129,"-Oh, my God."
272,ep129,-Do you see that?
273,ep129,-Yes. the house we looked at before.
274,ep129,Landing a house in the competitive Tacoma market has been tough for Laura and Josh.
275,ep129,Josh is concerned about losing out in bidding wars.
276,ep129,And Laura doesn't want to get a home that needs too much work.
277,ep129,"So their broker has lined up a smaller updated house, she hopes will appeal to both of them."
278,ep129,-A one?
279,ep129,-I would love to have another bath.
280,ep129,"A one bathroom though, I mean, hopefully we can-- -Yeah."
281,ep129,"-You know, not be up against so many other people bidding on it."
282,ep129,-I think it's up here on the right.
283,ep129,-Okay. craftsman.
284,ep129,I love it.
285,ep129,-Looks like a recent roof.
286,ep129,-Nice. that's good.
287,ep129,"Oh, I love the craftsman look."
288,ep129,Looks like it was well cared for.
289,ep129,Loving the porch.
290,ep129,"Yeah, the porch is super cute."
291,ep129,So this home was built in 1910.
292,ep129,"Wow. I think that you might like the kitchen, Josh, because there is a little bit of a mid-century modern feel to it."
293,ep129,"Oh, nice."
294,ep129,I'm looking forward to that.
295,ep129,Let's head on in.
296,ep129,Okay. at the floors.
297,ep129,Aren't they fabulous?
298,ep129,They are in really great shape.
299,ep129,And actually the homeowner is a cabinet builder.
300,ep129,"-Oh, cool."
301,ep129,-So they did some renovations that tried to stick with the original character of the home.
302,ep129,I'm really loving these wood accents.
303,ep129,Mmm-hmm. first of three bedrooms.
304,ep129,Ooh. kind of a cool like...
305,ep129,This little feature.
306,ep129,Do you think that's like an original thing from that era?
307,ep129,"Oh, for sure."
308,ep129,"Yeah. a lot of people tended to hang their paintings with the chain, hanging from the ledge, rather than actually get into nailing into the plaster."
309,ep129,-Hang your artwork that way.
310,ep129,Yeah. think I'm really pleased with the way it looks on the inside.
311,ep129,It's beautiful.
312,ep129,It's been really well updated and restored.
313,ep129,This is adorable.
314,ep129,"Wow. this is really, really nice."
315,ep129,It's kind of spacious for a bathroom.
316,ep129,We are gonna head on into this -mid-century kitchen.
317,ep129,Oh. is what I'm talking about.
318,ep129,-[Yvette laughing]
319,ep129,Yeah. is what I'm talking about.
320,ep129,-You are loving it.
321,ep129,-I love these details.
322,ep129,I knew you would love that.
323,ep129,This stove is killing me.
324,ep129,"-Yeah, this stove is unbelievable."
325,ep129,-What is this?
326,ep129,Ahhh! at this.
327,ep129,"Oh, you can put your little pies in there."
328,ep129,-We gotta wear an apron to use this one.
329,ep129,"Mmm-hmm. think that the only thing that would make this stove any better, if it was pink."
330,ep129,"Yeah, this is a really cute kitchen."
331,ep129,I'm not loving the countertops.
332,ep129,-Um... you can change.
333,ep129,Mm-hmm. got a little bit of a surprise for you -right this way.
334,ep129,All right.
335,ep129,-[Laura gasps]
336,ep129,This used to be a porch.
337,ep129,This is the cutest little thing.
338,ep129,I love these windows.
339,ep129,And I love that they painted the beadboard ceiling -a fun color.
340,ep129,Mm-hmm. might go with a different color.
341,ep129,"Oh, look at this yard."
342,ep129,This is so cute.
343,ep129,Pretty spacious.
344,ep129,"I wanted to point out this detached garage, -which is pretty cool."
345,ep129,Yeah. the second floor is not actually usable.
346,ep129,And that's because the floor is maybe a little wonky.
347,ep129,"-It's a little dark, but it's a good size."
348,ep129,All right.
349,ep129,The space is certainly big enough.
350,ep129,Mm-hmm. can kind of peek through and see the second floor up there.
351,ep129,"The garage looked like it was a very usable studio space, but seeing the second story on there, and having no access to it, is a little alarming to me."
352,ep129,I'd be a little concerned about the condition of that upper floor.
353,ep129,"-Ooh, these are narrow little stairs."
354,ep129,"-Yeah, watch your head, Josh."
355,ep129,"Yeah, it's a little..."
356,ep129,No room.
357,ep129,-...awkward. head.
358,ep129,Watch your noggin.
359,ep129,-This is really quirky.
360,ep129,Yeah. this would be sort of a weird bedroom.
361,ep129,-But it could work as an office.
362,ep129,Yes. 'cause it looks like there's another room through there.
363,ep129,-So to access that...
364,ep129,"-Right, so this is considered one bedroom."
365,ep129,I love this window and this light fixture.
366,ep129,"Yeah, no."
367,ep129,-These ceilings are super low though.
368,ep129,-For you.
369,ep129,-They are pretty low.
370,ep129,"For the size if it, I would almost be tempted to make this the main bedroom."
371,ep129,That could work.
372,ep129,"Or maybe in future you guys, um, -added another second bath to this."
373,ep129,-Yeah. is plumbing downstairs.
374,ep129,Mm-hmm. running that up is not terrible.
375,ep129,I think it's really charming.
376,ep129,"I can appreciate the craftsman accents and stuff like this, but it's got the mid-century kitchen, you know, that I like."
377,ep129,"I mean, it's move-in ready."
378,ep129,"Of course, other than your art studio."
379,ep129,Right. the fact that there's only one bath is a bit of a hmm.
380,ep129,-And the bedrooms upstairs are a little awkward.
381,ep129,Mm-hmm. why don't you guys think about it?
382,ep129,I think we have probably another day before I need an answer.
383,ep129,It's difficult to imagine your life in a place...
384,ep129,"Mm-hmm. care enough to put a bid in, -and get outbid."
385,ep129,Right. like such a heartbreak.
386,ep129,Yvette has been texting me non-stop.
387,ep129,-Mm-hmm. gotta make a decision quickly.
388,ep129,"Yeah, this market's brutal."
389,ep129,It is!
390,ep129,"Now that Laura and Josh have looked at several contenders in Tacoma, they have to decide which one is right for them."
391,ep129,The blue house on the hill had the best curb appeal.
392,ep129,It's just got that craftsman feel.
393,ep129,Really high ceilings.
394,ep129,"But the ceiling was pretty low up there, in the upstairs area."
395,ep129,But it has a really nice big kitchen.
396,ep129,My work's cut out for me to turn that garage into a studio.
397,ep129,"That was one of the only properties that we looked at that has more than one bathroom, which is attractive to me."
398,ep129,"Yeah, but it kind of suspected that."
399,ep129,The price seems suspiciously low at 330.
400,ep129,But room to bid up.
401,ep129,"I mean, we're gonna have to bid up no matter what."
402,ep129,"The mid-century house, that one big giant living room that they installed in the back, I'm thinking we can put a pool table back there."
403,ep129,"That garage, I think, would be the easiest art studio conversion."
404,ep129,The wall and the yard were the only things going right for the house for me.
405,ep129,"It was rough around the edges, but I think that it could be restored to its original mid-century charm."
406,ep129,It needs a ton of work.
407,ep129,And I'm honestly not that sure that it has that much charm lying beneath the surface.
408,ep129,"Well, there was the classic craftsman that we saw."
409,ep129,I love those floors.
410,ep129,-And the previous owners have put so much work...
411,ep129,-Mm-hmm. those wood accents.
412,ep129,Yeah. thing I didn't like about it was how narrow the stairway was going up to the upstairs.
413,ep129,And that was a sorry excuse for an upstairs.
414,ep129,"But it had that kitchen, that's sort of in the style that you like."
415,ep129,Mm-hmm. did you think of the studio space?
416,ep129,"I feel like it was workable, but the way that we were not allowed to go into the upper level of that, it concerns me that that whole structure just needed to be demolished."
417,ep129,-What do you think?
418,ep129,-Which one are we gonna choose?
419,ep129,[doorbell rings]
420,ep129,-Grab this one?
421,ep129,-Okay. decided to go with the blue house on the hill.
422,ep129,It was the most beautiful house.
423,ep129,I loved it as soon as I walked in.
424,ep129,The view was everything it promised.
425,ep129,It's just an amazing panoramic view of Mount Rainier.
426,ep129,Right about here.
427,ep129,"In order to be competitive on this house we had to bid up to our maximum, and we had to beat out 30 other offers."
428,ep129,"But, uh, then we got it."
429,ep129,"I think our offer stood out both, because it was very competitive, and also, we found out that the selling agent was also a Stage 4 cancer survivor."
430,ep129,So I think that personal connection with the selling agent went a long way towards moving our offer towards the top of the stack.
431,ep129,Yeah. looks great.
432,ep129,-Okay. look around and I just love everything that I see.
433,ep129,"It's such a old house, it's got some quirks."
434,ep129,It is both too short and too tall.
435,ep129,-[Laura chuckles]
436,ep129,I'm bumping my head in the upstairs bathroom...
437,ep129,-But at the same time...
438,ep129,-Yeah. reach the top cabinet in the kitchen.
439,ep129,My fiddle.
440,ep129,-Yeah. I was wondering where that was.
441,ep129,"We painted the walls of the living room white and then we painted the dining room a dark teal, and then added this beautiful accent wall behind us."
442,ep129,"Eventually, I'll get to the kitchen."
443,ep129,I'd like to do a new backsplash in there and probably paint the cabinets.
444,ep129,"I think the studio-garage conversion, it's gonna cost maybe about $2,200."
445,ep129,"So you just gotta sell one large piece of art, -and you got it done."
446,ep129,"I mean, yeah."
447,ep129,-[strumming guitar]
448,ep129,"-A, E, B."
449,ep129,[plays chord on fiddle]
450,ep129,That's not so tough.
451,ep129,"Considering what the last decade has been like for us both, you know, in our rental experiences and my health, it does feel nice to move into a place that we can call home."
452,ep129,It's something that we own together...
453,ep129,-Mm-hmm. I feel like we can really make our home -for a long time.
454,ep129,-Yeah.
1,ep130,entryway. Look at
2,ep130,"this. After years of hard work renovating and flipping houses, real estate agent Tamara and husband Mike are finally in a position to afford a dream home of their"
3,ep130,own. And he'd like this one to be move in
4,ep130,ready. Not one thing for me to touch in these rooms
5,ep130,here. Completely
6,ep130,"done. But with pricey homes in the Chicago suburb they're targeting, she still thinks it's smarter to take in one more"
7,ep130,"fixer. Remove this wall, and make a laundry station, we have enough wiggle room to do the products ourselves, gain instant equity for ourselves and for our family in the"
8,ep130,future. And changing her mind is no easy
9,ep130,"task. -She's very bossy, I'd"
10,ep130,say. -Somebody has to run the
11,ep130,household. Somebody's got to get things
12,ep130,done. [theme music
13,ep130,playing] -What sound does a train
14,ep130,make? -Honk. that's not a
15,ep130,train. I'm an educator for EL bilingual students and I'm also a real estate
16,ep130,agent. And I am a head custodian at the local school
17,ep130,"district. The first time I met her, I was very intimidated because she was a senior and I was a"
18,ep130,freshman. -I don't remember this at
19,ep130,"all. And then I went away for the military right after high school and then we didn't reconnect until I got back, we have two kids, Keenan, who is four years old, and Taelyn who is 10 months"
20,ep130,"old. I'm going to start making some pasta, you want some pasta,"
21,ep130,"bud? We recently just sold our home in Brookfield,"
22,ep130,Illinois. So we are currently staying in temporary housing right
23,ep130,"now. That was actually the third home that we had renovated together, I have the"
24,ep130,vision. Mike is the one who is actually assigned to do the
25,ep130,work. We really do make a good
26,ep130,"team. He can watch a video online and figure out how to do a whole basement by himself, as he's pretty remarkable with just picking things"
27,ep130,up. Now with having two kids with wanting to be in a stable position near our family and
28,ep130,friends. I think I'm looking at a home with more long term possibility for
29,ep130,us. That's exactly what I was hoping to hear 'cause it's always been one of those things where it's an investment and we're going to sell it in two
30,ep130,years. 'Cause I am physically exhausted from doing the work on these other homes that we
31,ep130,"had. I would love to purchase our next home in Downers Grove close to both of our families, schools, recreation, community events, we can have childcare we'd need within five"
32,ep130,minutes. It would be kind of like an Everyone Loves Raymond
33,ep130,"situation. I do appreciate what our families do for us, but I keep telling you, you know how I kind of like privacy, I don't really want to come home and see two parents sitting on our front doorstep, But our kids are little now, it's the ideal time for us to be close to our"
34,ep130,family. -I got
35,ep130,nothing. -[both
36,ep130,"laughing] I'd like to look in the price range of maybe, like,"
37,ep130,475. That's a little steep with the figures I've put
38,ep130,"together. I'd really like to go higher, because I want something that's"
39,ep130,"done. If we do the work ourselves, we can get a lot more for our money, don't put the money in someone else's hands, put the money in our hands, I'm sorry, but in order to get a house in this crazy market, we're going to have to look at some fixer"
40,ep130,"uppers. She's very bossy, I'd"
41,ep130,"say. Somebody has to run the household, somebody's got to get things done with two jobs, two kids, I got to move all the"
42,ep130,time. I really want a
43,ep130,Georgian. I want a brick house that's more solid on the
44,ep130,exterior. I did grew up in a Georgian
45,ep130,"home. -I really love the style, - The style I am looking for is something a little bit more"
46,ep130,"traditional. Where you have all your bedrooms upstairs, we are definitely going to need a basement, make sure that there's a space where I can"
47,ep130,actually... put my tools and I can work on some of the woodworking that I
48,ep130,"do. I want to make sure that we have an open living room to the kitchen, we can see the kids in the living"
49,ep130,"room. Like, maybe an island or something, we always like eating at"
50,ep130,islands. It would be wonderful to have a large yard for our kids to play in and be able to spread
51,ep130,"out. Our biggest challenge working as an agent for the two of us is finding a home where he feels like he doesn't have tons of work to do, but where I feel is though the price is going to be affordable for"
52,ep130,"us. It is a great day to be back in Downers Grove, four bedroom, two and a half bath home, five minutes from my parents'"
53,ep130,house. It'll really help when we're dropping off the
54,ep130,kids. You know how I feel about that
55,ep130,though. -What's the
56,ep130,price? -385. wrong with
57,ep130,"it? -Some updates, but at that price"
58,ep130,"point. I really think it may be worth at least looking at it, it's coming up in the"
59,ep130,corner. All brick
60,ep130,"exterior. Ooh, I like to see hardwood floors right away, that makes me very"
61,ep130,"happy. I really do like this entryway, this entire room's all squared off, easy to put furniture"
62,ep130,in. This is gonna need some
63,ep130,"work. I really don't like this wall, we don't have an eyesight view of the kids up there in the living"
64,ep130,room. That's a load bearing wall right
65,ep130,"there. You got to put a steel beam up from that point over here, I'm willing to bet you're gonna say, knock off this wall over here next,"
66,ep130,"too. It's a significant project, but think of the"
67,ep130,potential. I know it's not exactly what Mike was looking for after finishing a huge remodeling project in our last
68,ep130,"home. For this location, we would be spending well over 550,000 to even come close to a"
69,ep130,"home. With the renovation that somebody else has done, it may not be our taste, it may not be what we're looking for, let's create it"
70,ep130,"ourselves. I mean it may need a little bit of upgrades over time, but it's a"
71,ep130,"bathroom. Over here, I love the space as a mudroom potential with"
72,ep130,laundry. It's a little shallow for
73,ep130,"laundry. It is shallow, let's go see what's in this area over"
74,ep130,here. A little wet
75,ep130,"bar. Well,"
76,ep130,"ideas? Let's remove this wall and make a laundry station with a folding area, then we can have a foldable door somewhere in here, it would add a lot of value to the"
77,ep130,"home. I do love the crown molding in this room, I love the chair rail, everything's really cohesive, I would leave it as"
78,ep130,is. All the room needs is to be painted
79,ep130,gray. Fireplace could use a little
80,ep130,"update. Not the biggest fan, it looks more like something you'd see outside -and"
81,ep130,"indoors. -But with a little paint, I think we can freshen this"
82,ep130,"up. Hardwood floors and the whole first floor, huge perk, we're saving ourselves at least $10,000 -just on the main floor of"
83,ep130,hardwoods. -Uh-huh. do like the
84,ep130,hardwoods. -So
85,ep130,for... I believe this is the door to the
86,ep130,"garage. It's a big garage just a plus, I mean, it's a two car"
87,ep130,garage. -Okay. two and a
88,ep130,"half. Well, we've never had an attached garage and we've never had such a large garage, so this has"
89,ep130,"potential. All hardwood, all the way up, pretty"
90,ep130,nice. Primary
91,ep130,bedroom. Overall excellent
92,ep130,"size. I do worry about this though, possible roof leak, that's a $20,000 job right there"
93,ep130,alone. I do believe that that is a valid
94,ep130,"concern. However, this is workable, we can always renovate it over time, but it's got size we"
95,ep130,need. Definitely need some new grout
96,ep130,work. This will be the kids'
97,ep130,bathroom. Very
98,ep130,"retro. However, when they're young, they're not going to notice it, we can keep it until they're a little"
99,ep130,"older. Look at this, it looks like a perfect little girl's"
100,ep130,"room. This has got lots of sunshine coming through, hardwood floors are in decent"
101,ep130,"condition. Okay, so this is great potential for either Keenan's bedroom or for a study, definitely space for dressers, any of his toys, this is a really good size in"
102,ep130,"here. -Yeah, it"
103,ep130,"is. -I do see the logic in a home like this, I think this house will definitely give us the space we want as a"
104,ep130,"family. Wow, this carpet needs to"
105,ep130,go. It's just basement
106,ep130,stairs. What happened
107,ep130,here? Looks like they maybe had a leak or
108,ep130,"something. So you really wanted a workshop, it looks like this basement -does have a"
109,ep130,workshop. It's a little
110,ep130,"small. Remember, upstairs, we talked about the potential of a laundry room and then you'd have this entire"
111,ep130,"space. It is a place for you just to do your woodworking, any project you"
112,ep130,"want. More work, I'm not doing it"
113,ep130,"all. We're at the lower end of our price point here, we can do"
114,ep130,this. So this door has been updated which is
115,ep130,nice. -It looks like
116,ep130,it. It's
117,ep130,huge. But it needs some
118,ep130,"work. I don't like having the house right behind us however, I feel like if we fence it, we can create privacy for ourselves, the kids will have plenty of places to"
119,ep130,play. We'll do one project at a
120,ep130,time. Think about the long term benefits of being close to
121,ep130,"everybody. We've worked really hard for the past eight years, I'd like to see if there's other options out there, so that way we can just sit back,"
122,ep130,"relax. I do care about what Mike thinks, and I want to consider his"
123,ep130,"feelings. So this time, Tamara is really trying to honor what her husband"
124,ep130,wants. You really gave me a hard time about homes that need too much
125,ep130,"work. -Mm-hmm. we're gonna go look at a beautiful home, it's a little bit above our price"
126,ep130,"range. Well, what's a little bit above our price"
127,ep130,"range? Real estate agent Tamara's looking for another project, but after renovating three"
128,ep130,homes. Mike's insisting on something more move in
129,ep130,ready. You really gave me a hard time about homes that needs too much
130,ep130,"work. -Mm-hmm. we're going to go look at a beautiful, traditional Georgian home, it's a little bit above our price"
131,ep130,"range. Well, what's a little bit above our price"
132,ep130,"range? 499,"
133,ep130,nine. If it's got everything I like and everything I
134,ep130,need. And here's the best part for
135,ep130,you. -It's about 20 minutes away from both of our
136,ep130,family. -Oh! a plus
137,ep130,side. It gives you all the privacy that you've been talking
138,ep130,about. It is
139,ep130,gorgeous. Wow. a big
140,ep130,house. That is a huge
141,ep130,yard. Definitely going to need a riding lawnmower for
142,ep130,that. Gorgeous
143,ep130,entryway. Look at
144,ep130,"this. -Travertine tile as soon as you walk in,"
145,ep130,-Wow. -Grand staircase that you really
146,ep130,"like. -Love the staircase, it's got the dentil molding, I mean, it's absolutely"
147,ep130,gorgeous. -Huge living
148,ep130,room. -It's got
149,ep130,"hardwoods. They're in good condition, plenty of space for the kids, not one thing for me to touch in these rooms here, Completely"
150,ep130,"done. Everything is solid oak, it's all matching, no work to do on any of the doors or"
151,ep130,trim. Bathroom's nice and
152,ep130,"large. Oh, my"
153,ep130,"gosh. Another huge room, so that looks like that would be the perfect study right there, and another living space, it looks like this would be the family"
154,ep130,"room. I've got a great eyesight line to the kitchen, so we can see the kids, I do love the fireplace, it needs to be updated a little bit, but we can do that with some fresh"
155,ep130,tile. I do love the vaulted ceiling with the beams absolutely gorgeous with the
156,ep130,"skylights. Look at the windows coming in on both sides, nice and"
157,ep130,"bright. Absolutely beautiful facing this beautiful, gorgeous yard"
158,ep130,too. Wow. the kitchen's already
159,ep130,done. It's got the island like we
160,ep130,"want. That's a huge hood, I've never seen anything like"
161,ep130,this. -It's the style
162,ep130,"now. -Cabinets are nice and dark, nothing to"
163,ep130,"remodel. Laundry room on the first floor, just like you"
164,ep130,wanted. Perfect. is basically my
165,ep130,dream. If I can have a laundry room on the main
166,ep130,floor. -It's
167,ep130,perfect. -Looks
168,ep130,like... -Gonna be
169,ep130,ideal. -You have the garage right
170,ep130,"here. Oh, my"
171,ep130,"gosh. -So, plenty of"
172,ep130,space. It's
173,ep130,"huge. All right, let's go take a look at the second"
174,ep130,"floor. Hardwood all the way up, reminds me of those old, vintage staircases I"
175,ep130,"love. -Homecoming pictures,"
176,ep130,"right? -Oh,"
177,ep130,yeah. -And
178,ep130,prom. - As I'm walking through the
179,ep130,"house. All I can think to myself is the renovations look great, and I don't have to touch a"
180,ep130,thing. Plenty of space for us to grow
181,ep130,into. I love how all the bedrooms are on the second
182,ep130,"floor. Just needs a little fresh color of paint, maybe a new"
183,ep130,fan. Bigger than any suite in a hotel I've ever
184,ep130,"seen. Wow, the"
185,ep130,"sunlight. The view, -is just absolutely"
186,ep130,stunning. -I feel like we'd probably be able to fit -our whole house in this
187,ep130,room. Look at the
188,ep130,"tub. I really wouldn't touch this room except getting rid of all the brass, there is brass fixtures"
189,ep130,"everywhere. The way I look at it, is it"
190,ep130,"functional? Yes, we'll leave"
191,ep130,it. A couple updates can be
192,ep130,done. I just love the hardwoods in this
193,ep130,house. I'm guessing this is the
194,ep130,basement. -Hardwoods
195,ep130,again. Wow. like they got slate tile down
196,ep130,"here. -Wow, it's totally"
197,ep130,finished. -It's really
198,ep130,big. And
199,ep130,"bright. This is, like, a"
200,ep130,palace. Even here they have a bedroom set up with a
201,ep130,fireplace. Another
202,ep130,"bathroom. Oh, my"
203,ep130,"gosh. This home is definitely gonna give us plenty of space for us to spread out, there was a little nook too, that kind of gave me some space for a"
204,ep130,"workspace. Wow. to your acre of land, look at"
205,ep130,this. Lots of
206,ep130,mowing. I'll buy you the riding
207,ep130,"mower. Look at this pond, there's fish in"
208,ep130,it. Keenan would love
209,ep130,this. This is so
210,ep130,cool. This is
211,ep130,"perfect. Backyard is beautiful and would be great for the kids to be able to play out there, I really like the stonework that was around the pond and the pavers that were for the"
212,ep130,patio. I think we found
213,ep130,it. It's a lot of home for
214,ep130,"us. -Yeah, a lot of house that doesn't need"
215,ep130,"updating. -True. not saying we can't do it, we just have to look at the affordability standpoint, I need to go home, run some numbers, make a"
216,ep130,"spreadsheet. This home is at the top of our price range, but we've worked so hard renovating homes that we really could afford this dream home, that doesn't require renovations, it doesn't require a lot of work, and Mike would get the personal space that he's really looking"
217,ep130,for. The home is going to be harder to obtain due to the multiple offers that it will probably
218,ep130,"receive. In the meantime, she's found a more affordable home that might be a good"
219,ep130,"compromise. Just got relisted yesterday, seven or eight minutes away from"
220,ep130,"family. Well there's a stoplight in between, so it's got a little bit of a"
221,ep130,"buffer. After flipping three homes in short order, Mike and Tamara are looking for a place they can settle, long term, but she wants a fixer close to their parents in Downers Grove, and he wants a move in ready place a little farther"
222,ep130,"out. Just got relisted yesterday, it turns out that the buyer walked"
223,ep130,away. -All
224,ep130,right. -So we have a
225,ep130,"chance. This home is not going to last, homes do not go for sale here very often, the real estate market is so competitive that every house is receiving 10 offers or more, it's four bedrooms, two and a half baths with a finished"
226,ep130,"basement. 429, nine, still about seven or eight minutes away from"
227,ep130,"family. Well there's a stoplight in between, so it's got a little bit of a"
228,ep130,"buffer. No brick, but it does have"
229,ep130,stone. It looks a lot like a
230,ep130,colonial. This is
231,ep130,nice. I like
232,ep130,"it. The paint's not chipping, it's well"
233,ep130,maintained. Gorgeous woodworking right
234,ep130,"now. Wow. floors, right, once you walk"
235,ep130,in. I like this little nook they have over
236,ep130,"here. Yeah, we could put a little seating bench right"
237,ep130,"here. Hardwood floors throughout the entire first floor, that's exactly what I"
238,ep130,"want. All I would do is just take the brass off, but I can do that"
239,ep130,later. And
240,ep130,"look... a beeline eyesight straight to the kitchen, open concept for the"
241,ep130,"kiddos. It's kind of nice to have all this glass over here, to let all the sunlight"
242,ep130,"in. Oh, my, look at the golf course"
243,ep130,view. A real nice spot to
244,ep130,"entertain. I would say the yard's manageable, you know, it wouldn't take me too long to"
245,ep130,"mow. Even the deck here, it's in great"
246,ep130,"condition. I can see the busy road and I can see the shopping centers, you know how I feel about that, not what I was looking for in terms of neighborhood, but I can handle it to have a golf course behind"
247,ep130,us. -You can plant some bushes or something to hide
248,ep130,it. -Right. been updated with 42 inch
249,ep130,cabinets. A lot of the work that we would do has been done for
250,ep130,us. I do like that there's an island
251,ep130,"here. Even the half bath, yes, it's small, but it's completely"
252,ep130,finished. -The staircase
253,ep130,"matches. -The carpet looks well maintained, looks like it's pretty"
254,ep130,new. Keenan would roll his trucks and trains all down this
255,ep130,hallway. I could see him throwing it over the ballasts over there
256,ep130,"though. Oh, my gosh, it's got a hideaway up"
257,ep130,"there. Yeah, I just might have to build a ladder to make that my"
258,ep130,"clubhouse. That's very cool, I love the beam, there's carpet which is not perfect, but it's in great condition, so I don't see a door leading to the bathroom, but maybe we can have you put one"
259,ep130,"in. I'm not too worried about it, it should just be us up in"
260,ep130,"here. -So, there's only one"
261,ep130,thing. -But I do like how there's some space right
262,ep130,"here. I'd rather have the double sink and look at this shower, brand new tile, these chandeliers, we may have to change these over time, but they're fine for now until we can find"
263,ep130,another. If it's
264,ep130,"spacious. -So there's a big vanity in here for the kids' bathroom, may need to be upgraded over time, but nothing wrong with it when they're"
265,ep130,young. They're just showering and bathing in
266,ep130,"here. So, this is just a plastic surround tub, just covering up the original tile but, you know what, the kids will be fine in here, I wouldn't change it until they got older, -Works for me,"
267,ep130,so... -It'll
268,ep130,do. It's
269,ep130,operational. And these would probably be the kids' bedrooms back here
270,ep130,"then. Probably, very similar, so that way they can't fight over who's got the bigger"
271,ep130,room. Let's go check out the
272,ep130,"basement. New carpeting, it's really"
273,ep130,nice. This is really big for a
274,ep130,"basement. Everything matches, the trim, the railings, same as"
275,ep130,upstairs. It's really
276,ep130,"nice. A workshop for you, you can have all your saw dust right"
277,ep130,here. Looks more like a laundry room to
278,ep130,me. I don't know if you'd want your laundry to get all
279,ep130,"dusty. So if we could put the laundry upstairs, we can think about it for the"
280,ep130,"future. Good price, especially for how well maintained it was, don't have to do much work, be able to come home from work and"
281,ep130,"relax. It does not have that Downers Grove address, you know I had my heart set on"
282,ep130,"that. Close to our families, close to everything we want to be"
283,ep130,near. Can she sell Mike on a move in ready to get a home in her dream
284,ep130,"neighborhood? We got to figure this out, we have so much on our plates, like, we need a house,"
285,ep130,"ASAP. After renovating multiple homes, Tamara and Mike are finally in a position to buy a long term place for their"
286,ep130,family. How do you feel about the Downers Grove
287,ep130,"house. 385, yes, it has renovations, but five minutes to our families, and we can make it our"
288,ep130,"own. Lots of renovations, uses lots of"
289,ep130,work. I just don't know if I'm gonna have enough time for that with my schedule right
290,ep130,now. But we can do it over
291,ep130,time. It is a little close to our
292,ep130,families. I'd like little bit of a
293,ep130,buffer. How about the Orland Park house that was 499
294,ep130,nine? But there wasn't a thing for us to do in that
295,ep130,"house. It was stunning, I mean, Georgian style one acre of"
296,ep130,"land. However, it's more than we want to spend and it's 4,000 square feet, is it just too much for us, is it really what we"
297,ep130,"need? We'd have plenty of room to spread out, 20 minutes away from our families, gave me plenty of breathing"
298,ep130,"room. We really need to be close to our families, let's talk about the house in"
299,ep130,"Woodbridge. It's 429, nine, move in"
300,ep130,"condition. There's very little to do in that home, unless you want to make updates over"
301,ep130,"time. It's only about eight minutes from our families, -that golf course"
302,ep130,view. -Also you have the deck that was completely
303,ep130,"finished. You can see the mall and the shopping center at night with all the lights, not in Downers Grove, you know, that's what I really"
304,ep130,"want. I mean, that just might be one of the things that we need to sacrifice, so, we move in there and I really don't have to lift a finger to do"
305,ep130,"anything. Oh, my God, there's boxes"
306,ep130,everywhere. We chose the house in Downers
307,ep130,Grove. The home was listed for
308,ep130,"385,000. We were able to negotiate for 380,000, it just made sense financially for us to buy the home and he now agrees that being close to family is an"
309,ep130,"asset. I really didn't want to get another house where I had so many renovations to do, but after Tamara showed me the numbers, I figured maybe we could hire some"
310,ep130,help. That way I don't have to do as much of the
311,ep130,"work. I'm going to put a call into our construction crew this weekend, I want to start talking to them about laying out this"
312,ep130,kitchen. The first project we need to work on is the
313,ep130,"kitchen. It's quite outdated, it's an original to the home, so we're going to be taking down a wall to create an island in between, so we can have living and dining in the same"
314,ep130,space. In order for me to create a workspace in the basement for
315,ep130,"myself. We'd also like to take the laundry, and move it upstairs into the"
316,ep130,mudroom. We're estimating that the renovations for this home will be about
317,ep130,"$50,000. I have painters coming next week, everything would be organized and ready to go just in that"
318,ep130,"room. This home provides longevity for our family, our kids are young, they're going to grow up here, they're in the perfect location close to our"
319,ep130,"families. We can do the renovation one room at a time, and we can do it"
320,ep130,"slowly. I definitely trust Tamara's vision for this home a 100%, she really hasn't steered us wrong in the"
321,ep130,past. We can make this our dream
322,ep130,home. [both

18,ep131,"You know, papa told me that I don't know how to make the shrimp and grits, like he knows how to make the shrimp and grits, and you know mine are better than parents."
19,ep131,I live in Kannapolis with my son and my day.
20,ep131,This is what happens when you start cooking later in the executive.
21,ep131,"I started out as a single mom and I saw that I couldn't do it by myself, because I'm a regional account a..."
22,ep131,"You know, it's travel."
23,ep131,it's a lot of needs.
24,ep131,"Thankfully, my parents stepped in and we came together to buy this house, so that we could raise my son together and give him the full family experience that he something?"
25,ep131,You're moving because we're not treating you right -or break.
26,ep131,Now is the good time to make the college.
27,ep131,Joseph and I will have an opportunity to be able to grow together for a couple of years before he goes off to this.
28,ep131,-Look at about...
29,ep131,-That... it ready.
30,ep131,"Um, I guess, when you count to 15, they're it?"
31,ep131,"That looks good, doesn't beautiful."
32,ep131,"Oh, that's units."
33,ep131,"What you find here in Kannapolis, people are settled, they're in their family fun."
34,ep131,I need to be in the city where I can have some there.
35,ep131,"And, you know, I can kinda maybe go on a date here and while..."
36,ep131,-It's been a is?
37,ep131,"-Oh, that's what the deal is..."
38,ep131,-The deal that.
39,ep131,-That's... is exactly why I want my own space in the house because I don't want no part of effort.
40,ep131,"Even though my son is 16, this is a team it."
41,ep131,I want his opinion and I want him to like Charlotte.
42,ep131,I'm looking to buy in downtown.
43,ep131,My son wants to be closer into and...
44,ep131,I like walking around and go into the malls things.
45,ep131,-Yeah. type of downtown.
46,ep131,"But it's going to be so difficult for his grandparents to have to navigate the road, so I'd rather be outside of style."
47,ep131,The thing that we're gonna have most difficulty on is going to be modern.
48,ep131,I like mid-century Victorian.
49,ep131,I like house.
50,ep131,I like the older character of a it.
51,ep131,I like the story that comes behind house.
52,ep131,"Living in the area that we live in, I know it's going to be difficult to find the things that I like, but if I can find those pops, I can settle on that for my colors."
53,ep131,"So, I'm more modern and clean lines, cooler $450,000."
54,ep131,The bank approved me up to number.
55,ep131,"However, $400,000 would be the best extensive."
56,ep131,"And the house we live in now, it's city."
57,ep131,Where we're going is more less.
58,ep131,The square footage would be yet.
59,ep131,"I'm becoming a minimalist, but I'm just not one quite sq."
60,ep131,"We're thinking at least 2,300 that."
61,ep131,ft. I'm fine with bathroom.

124,ep131,-Okay. is your nice.
125,ep131,"Oh. a pretty day, this would be really fountain."
126,ep131,Look at the enough.
127,ep131,This is not backyard.
128,ep131,"Being in the city, this is exactly what I wanted, except the me."
129,ep131,It doesn't really matter to yard.
130,ep131,I could live with a little dinky here.

158,ep131,Really a good size closet for such a small bedroom.
159,ep131,"And again, hardwoods in the color."
160,ep131,I love this orange Balcony.

172,ep131,"It doesn't have my soaking tub, but I really do like area."
173,ep131,This bedroom has a seating area and a bedroom room?
174,ep131,Okay. it looks like two kinda bedroom.
175,ep131,Two because here's your chimney -coming up from the fun.
176,ep131,-Right. this room could be kind of guestroom.
177,ep131,That could be the office.
178,ep131,This could be your windows...
179,ep131,It's very bright here in this space -and the interesting...
180,ep131,-I thought this was really that's...
181,ep131,"-Oh, here."
182,ep131,-...way this space up -by putting windows before.
183,ep131,I haven't seen that either.
184,ep131,I haven't playing]
185,ep131,[upbeat music cute.
186,ep131,This is so the...
187,ep131,"Oh, look at Joseph."
188,ep131,"You always talk about the skyline, skyscrapers."
189,ep131,Yes. can see all the here.
190,ep131,You can see everything out of this.
191,ep131,"Yes, I like foggy."
192,ep131,And this is with it being it.
193,ep131,-I like that.
194,ep131,"-The view was good, -so you scored on good."

197,ep131,"Remember in the good old days when mom's would call us off the front porch like back in Martinsville and be like, ""It's time for eat."
198,ep131,-Time to go go.
199,ep131,Here you it?
200,ep131,"Oh, this is it."
201,ep131,This is idea...
202,ep131,"So, this gives you an spaces."
203,ep131,"Yeah. living, walkability, and small bathrooms."
204,ep131,My concern is that we really only have three bedrooms and two and a half someone.
205,ep131,"When we have company, I'm sharing a bathroom with friends?"
206,ep131,"This honestly is the perfect space for a single woman, which I am, but I've got a son, he's got friends, I've got friends, is there enough space for us to have our own spaces here and have our own sure."
207,ep131,I'm not location.
208,ep131,But to get more space and a yard means compromising on anything.
209,ep131,It doesn't seem like it's very close to playing]
210,ep131,[upbeat music bloom.
211,ep131,The trees are in that.
212,ep131,I love life.
213,ep131,"With her son almost out of the nest, single mom Veleria is interested in moving out of the house she shares with her parents in the distant suburbs and closer to Charlotte, so she can jumpstart her social city."
214,ep131,"But to get the size she wants, she may still have to search outside the bedrooms."
215,ep131,-Five especially.
216,ep131,"Oh. that will give me my space, it."
217,ep131,This is nice.
218,ep131,That's really playing]
219,ep131,[upbeat music is.
220,ep131,"Oh, look beautiful it fantastic."
221,ep131,The curb appeal of the house was story.
222,ep131,"The Victorian style wasn't necessarily there, but it is an older house, so it still comes with a so..."
223,ep131,"Veleria always likes to make an entrance, like..."
224,ep131,I steps.
225,ep131,"Yeah, coming to the party, -right down the laughs]"

293,ep131,We're over the downstairs.
294,ep131,"So, if he's up here with friends, -no one is being disturbed underneath."
295,ep131,-No one is good.
296,ep131,That's perfect.
297,ep131,"The big bonus room upstairs has speakers, which I could blast whatever I want or plug my game up into it and just play it loud, which is playing]"
298,ep131,[upbeat music then...

312,ep131,I'm just a little bit concerned that it is right at the top of what we want to spend.
313,ep131,But with everything you want is gonna be at the top -of what you wanna less.
314,ep131,"-Well, I've got to find a way to want challenges."
315,ep131,But less money can come with its own construction.
316,ep131,There is quite a bit of playing]
317,ep131,[upbeat music beeps]
318,ep131,-[phone now?
319,ep131,-Who's texting you school.

325,ep131,How much is list.
326,ep131,"$390,000. that's why it's on the construction."
327,ep131,There is quite a bit of day.

343,ep131,"Joseph, what do you couch."
344,ep131,-I like the furniture?
345,ep131,"You do know when we buy this, right, it does not come with okay."

353,ep131,[upbeat music hammering?
354,ep131,"So, can we talk about all the cul-de-sac..."
355,ep131,"Here's the ins and outs, there are two lots that are on a traffic."
356,ep131,-...so wouldn't have -the construction construction.
357,ep131,"-Okay. construction is always a challenge, so we're really gonna have to see if we can get tucked away on one side, which I think we can to where she won't be in all the mayhem of the new this."
358,ep131,"You know, I think about at home, Jos, you know, we're cooking and we've got a good open area like customize."
359,ep131,"Because it's new construction, we have a little bit of room to options..."
360,ep131,There are a couple of color cabinetry.
361,ep131,"-Okay. floors, -with the options."
362,ep131,"Options, tile..."

365,ep131,-Okay. gonna be proud of yet.
366,ep131,"I haven't gotten to the part that's gonna make you upset, along."
367,ep131,"So, I want you to be thinking about that -as we go this."
368,ep131,-Okay. like nice.
369,ep131,It's space.
370,ep131,It's a great little space.
371,ep131,"So, there are some units available -that back up to open premium."
372,ep131,-Okay. they carry a lot there.
373,ep131,-Okay. let's see if you like it enough -to entertain it before we go beautiful.
374,ep131,Okay. this is lot.
375,ep131,I like this a open.
376,ep131,This is really tub.
377,ep131,I know you want a soaking tub.

379,ep131,The whole bath has a tub if you want to option.
380,ep131,"-Okay. you can do that, but it's just not an bathroom."
381,ep131,This is what people want in the main understand.
382,ep131,I don't tub?
383,ep131,Why can't I replace this with my nice claw foot garden here.
384,ep131,Okay. the two bedrooms up office.
385,ep131,"They're a little tight, but I thought this would be great for your here?"
386,ep131,And see how quiet it is quiet.
387,ep131,It's very room?
388,ep131,Is this my room?
389,ep131,Would this be my Jack.
390,ep131,"Well, this is the last bedroom, so this is it, Buddy three."
391,ep131,"Well, this is bedroom number the..."
392,ep131,"I would want my own space, not want..."
393,ep131,-I space.
394,ep131,This is a you.
395,ep131,I don't wanna be down the hall from bath.
396,ep131,The base model is three bedroom and two and a half bedroom.
397,ep131,There is flex space on its own floor that can have a good.
398,ep131,That sounds me.
399,ep131,Do it for it?
400,ep131,"So, can we just look at it."
401,ep131,"Yeah, let's look at space."
402,ep131,This is my own upstairs.
403,ep131,"You, I guess, here."
404,ep131,I'll be down you.
405,ep131,I'd be two floors up from it.
406,ep131,-Exactly why I like garage...
407,ep131,"I hate to be the Debbie Downer, but you down here on a bottom floor, -the responsible."
408,ep131,-I'll be boy.
409,ep131,He's a good me?
410,ep131,-Are you kidding great...
411,ep131,-I am will...
412,ep131,-I 16-year-old.
413,ep131,I'm... is a great.
414,ep131,We came in with the price was space.
415,ep131,"Now, there's this added right?"
416,ep131,"Let's talk numbers, all $420,000."
417,ep131,"Premium lot and this bedroom and bathroom, it's gonna be still..."
418,ep131,-Okay. there.
419,ep131,-we're still still...
420,ep131,That's in...
421,ep131,-that's still still...
422,ep131,-We're box.
423,ep131,we're still in the box?
424,ep131,-Did you draw a did.
425,ep131,He box?
426,ep131,Did you put a dollar sign in the quick.
427,ep131,"You got a lot of homework to do, but we gotta work now."
428,ep131,This is the most competitive price range right that.
429,ep131,"So, really, really think about playing]"
430,ep131,[upbeat music here?
431,ep131,"Hey, what're you doing over school."
432,ep131,Research for life.
433,ep131,Its time for Veleria to choose which home will work for the next chapter of her Joseph.
434,ep131,"So, she's going over the options with her son much?"
435,ep131,Price on the downtown house was how neighborhood.
436,ep131,"$435,000. really like the blooming."
437,ep131,"People out walking their dogs, the trees were room."
438,ep131,"On the third floor, if you do let me get that want."
439,ep131,"When I look out the windows with my separate space from yours, I can definitely see the city, which is exactly what I bedrooms."
440,ep131,It was only three home.
441,ep131,-The single family in.
442,ep131,"Mmm-hmm. know, and that's a little bit more of what we're used to living best."
443,ep131,The bonus room with the speakers was the bedrooms?
444,ep131,-Was it five space.
445,ep131,-Yeah. and lots of outside.
446,ep131,Yeah. really do like the yard tub.
447,ep131,"I really, really liked my garden wanna..."
448,ep131,"So, now the new house build, the main room, living area with so much space through there and the countertop kitchen area -where you said you nice."
449,ep131,-That was so huge.
450,ep131,That island in the middle was on?
451,ep131,Mmm-hmm. also concerned about construction and how long is it going to be going built.
452,ep131,Because you could see that there's way more to be playing]
453,ep131,[upbeat music boy.
454,ep131,"Hey, here?"
455,ep131,What's going on Joseph.
456,ep131,"-Hi, build."
457,ep131,-Hello. the new right.
458,ep131,"The downtown home was too small, the single family home was too big and then, the townhouse, surprising to me, was just Charlotte."
459,ep131,"It's still close to $420,000."
460,ep131,"Yeah. the time we did the lot premium, the upgrades, the special room for Joseph downstairs, the final price was me."
461,ep131,"When we looked at the model, it was beautiful, but it wasn't tile."
462,ep131,"So, we went with a lighter floor, we went with the white countertops and the silver subway tub."
463,ep131,I did not get my garden elated.
464,ep131,"But it's a zen bathroom, so I'm us."
465,ep131,"Working with an agent that's also your friend is tough, but she did a fantastic job of finding something for both of friends."
466,ep131,I got my space downstairs for my bring.
467,ep131,She also got her space upstairs and in here for whoever she wants to fun.
468,ep131,"Yes, this is gonna be not."
469,ep131,"-No, it's laughs]"
470,ep131,-[Veleria me.
471,ep131,Not for
1,ep132,"Oh, wow."
2,ep132,"Oh, my gosh."
3,ep132,Isn't this amazing?
4,ep132,"Philadelphia couple Paul and Janese want to take their relationship to the next level by buying a house, and then getting engaged."
5,ep132,"Well, she still has to say yes, also."
6,ep132,-He still has to ask.
7,ep132,"-Yeah. when it comes to the house hunt, she thinks Paul's both too laid back, and too impulsive."
8,ep132,"You saw the link, of course, right?"
9,ep132,I've seen a lot of links.
10,ep132,What a great view.
11,ep132,I say we cut the check.
12,ep132,You want to make an offer?
13,ep132,Paul's definitely an airy Aquarius.
14,ep132,"When he sees something he likes, he's going to jump on it."
15,ep132,You want to buy this house?
16,ep132,I think we still have some things to talk about.
17,ep132,Can they get on the same page?
18,ep132,"We certainly don't have a nice view from here, but..."
19,ep132,"When we're sitting, we won't notice that."
20,ep132,"Agree, I already have the best view in town."
21,ep132,-Aww. -Yeah.
22,ep132,[doorbell rings]
23,ep132,[theme music playing]
24,ep132,Let me try your canned sauce.
25,ep132,-I didn't have time to let it simmer for three hours...
26,ep132,"-I know, I know."
27,ep132,...the your nonna does it.
28,ep132,He never asked me to be his girlfriend.
29,ep132,-We're just here two-and-a-half years later...
30,ep132,-Who asks anybody -to be their girlfriend now?
31,ep132,-We're just here two-and-a-half years later.
32,ep132,The idea was to live in the apartment together for a little while.
33,ep132,"Practice living together, but now, I think, time's, you know..."
34,ep132,-Time's right.
35,ep132,-Probably right.
36,ep132,"We're getting the house first, get settled, and then..."
37,ep132,[clicks tongue]
38,ep132,"Well, she still has to say yes, also."
39,ep132,-He still has to ask.
40,ep132,[Janese laughs]
41,ep132,You have to tell me what you want.
42,ep132,I'm pretty vocal all the time.
43,ep132,"I'm a Virgo, I don't really go with my heart, I go with my head."
44,ep132,"On the other hand, Pauls' definitely an airy Aquarius."
45,ep132,Very impulsive.
46,ep132,"As soon as he falls in love with something, that's it."
47,ep132,"I actually won't argue with that, even though it doesn't sound great."
48,ep132,"But I am a, tend to be a little bit impulsive."
49,ep132,"I'm not going to say that we're not on the same page, but haven't really loved anything we've seen thus far."
50,ep132,We're currently in the financial district of Center City.
51,ep132,"I don't have a car, I would love to stay in the city."
52,ep132,I absolutely would like to stay in the city also.
53,ep132,"However, there is maybe some benefits to looking out into the suburbs."
54,ep132,"You get so much more, at least, square-footage-wise."
55,ep132,We're going to have to give a little bit...
56,ep132,-Excuse me.
57,ep132,"-...to kind of, you know..."
58,ep132,"See, this is what I mean, we're definitely going to need a bigger kitchen, -because you're always right under me when I'm cooking."
59,ep132,"-Oh, my God."
60,ep132,-And I need my space.
61,ep132,-That's because I love you.
62,ep132,"Our apartment's great, it's just very small, even for just the two of us."
63,ep132,"And I have quite a big Italian family, so it'll be nice to have some more space."
64,ep132,"And, then, two completely different closet spaces is a must."
65,ep132,"We have a lot of clothes, each of us, a lot of shoes."
66,ep132,It is going to be nice when I have designated office space.
67,ep132,I own my own logistics business.
68,ep132,"And I am the Director of Operations, doing consulting for military, and first responders."
69,ep132,"Right now, our office is a shared space, so you can imagine the complications that come with that."
70,ep132,How do you feel about a mural?
71,ep132,Like a horse-racing mural like in my dad's house?
72,ep132,I don't like it.
73,ep132,"I probably take after my dad a little bit with his Italian style, like, more Tuscan looking, with a lot of browns, a lot of darker colors."
74,ep132,"So, basically, Paul is looking for a steakhouse in a house."
75,ep132,Who doesn't like going to a steakhouse?
76,ep132,"I like going, eating, and leaving to go home."
77,ep132,-That's fair.
78,ep132,"I came from a house that was very Minnesota, if you know what I'm saying."
79,ep132,There was orange shag carpet in my room.
80,ep132,"And so, for me, I want something that's more modern, clean lines, feeling like I'm waking up in luxury."
81,ep132,"We also have to find something that fits in our $650,000 price range."
82,ep132,"I know we've agreed on 650, but I definitely think we could find something a little lower, maybe even under 550."
83,ep132,"I'm happy to craft an email to Alex, have her show us some more stuff, but what do you want me to tell her?"
84,ep132,"Everything you just said now, I just need you to vocalize that in the moment."
85,ep132,"Our agent is Alex, and she's great."
86,ep132,"But Paul does not really verbalize what he likes, and doesn't like."
87,ep132,"I'm just not as comfortable talking with Alex, as I am with Janese."
88,ep132,That's just not the best when we're looking for a place to live.
89,ep132,"You saw the link, of course, right?"
90,ep132,I've seen a lot of links.
91,ep132,"Okay, so you didn't."
92,ep132,"Well, this house is three bedrooms, three-and-a-half baths, and it's right where we want to be, too."
93,ep132,I'm pretty sure this is it.
94,ep132,"This is it, here?"
95,ep132,It's nice.
96,ep132,"-Hi, guys, how are you?"
97,ep132,"-Hi, Alex."
98,ep132,-What do you think so far?
99,ep132,-Good. do really like the brick facade on the house.
100,ep132,"The garage is nice, he'll always have a place to park his car, -and we can park across to..."
101,ep132,"-You can, absolutely."
102,ep132,You can always put a second car here for guests.
103,ep132,The only thing I'm concerned about is that it's 649.
104,ep132,"For everything that this house offers, we think it's a great deal."
105,ep132,The whole reason that I'm bringing them to this house is because of the location.
106,ep132,"It's not quite modern enough for Janese, it's not quite Italian enough for Paul."
107,ep132,"But it is turnkey, so they can live with it as is for as long as they need to, and make changes as they go."
108,ep132,"It's very easy for Janese to express herself, so it's really important to me that Paul communicate openly with me."
109,ep132,It's what's going to help me narrow down the search for him.
110,ep132,"There's nice, high-ceilings, but this paint color has to go."
111,ep132,I like the paint.
112,ep132,You like the paint?
113,ep132,-I like the paint.
114,ep132,"-Of course, you do."
115,ep132,You've got a full bathroom in here.
116,ep132,"It's a little bit dated, but we can update that later down."
117,ep132,And this is the first of three bedrooms.
118,ep132,"Oh, wow, I mean, I really like the high ceilings."
119,ep132,"What are you thinking about this so far, Paul?"
120,ep132,It's a nice room.
121,ep132,-Yeah. what's next?
122,ep132,-I actually really love this paint color.
123,ep132,"Like, it could be a great space for my mom, especially, when she comes to visit."
124,ep132,It's like an in-law suite for when she becomes an in-law.
125,ep132,-So we have an in-law suite.
126,ep132,"Yeah. Paul, I really think this is going to be your space for sure."
127,ep132,"Oh, wow, yeah."
128,ep132,Yeah. I like it.
129,ep132,Does this work for you?
130,ep132,I do.
131,ep132,I like how big it is.
132,ep132,"One little project would be to rip up this floor, and do hardwood."
133,ep132,Maybe a horse racing mural on that wall.
134,ep132,"-Okay, so..."
135,ep132,"-This is your luxury office, you do with it what you want -outside of a mural."
136,ep132,Not for debate.
137,ep132,"-Right. right, let's go upstairs."
138,ep132,I definitely like how much light there is here.
139,ep132,This is nice.
140,ep132,The kitchen is a nice size.
141,ep132,"I would really want to change the entire orientation, so that it's parallel to the cabinets."
142,ep132,"Can you imagine, just, like, entertaining, and then, somebody has one too many, and then, -oops, downstairs."
143,ep132,"Well, they got to be careful."
144,ep132,-Okay. don't know about reorienting the island.
145,ep132,"I would say that's on the to-do list, but also, I would really prefer to stain the wood a darker color."
146,ep132,I like the color that it is.
147,ep132,"But I know that Janese doesn't like this color, so."
148,ep132,-Not at all.
149,ep132,All right.
150,ep132,"Well, I mean, you can meet me in the middle on something."
151,ep132,-Living room.
152,ep132,-Dining room.
153,ep132,-Right here.
154,ep132,-This is dining room.
155,ep132,Put a nice dining room table.
156,ep132,"Yeah. do like that there is a banister for the step, because I can already see that that would be a little bit of an issue with getting up, not realizing that there's a step."
157,ep132,Makes it a little safer.
158,ep132,House klutz.
159,ep132,Let's keep going.
160,ep132,Okay. interesting.
161,ep132,It's pink.
162,ep132,Baby room.
163,ep132,It's pink.
164,ep132,-It's called a nursery.
165,ep132,-Easily fixable.
166,ep132,"-Well. a baby room, or a nursery."
167,ep132,It's a nursery.
168,ep132,"-Okay, so this is the main bedroom."
169,ep132,"Correct. really love the color, and the fact that it has a ceiling fan, and the bay windows."
170,ep132,"Okay, if this is..."
171,ep132,"Oh, wow."
172,ep132,This is really small.
173,ep132,"Okay, so the closet will be a little..."
174,ep132,It'll be a seasonal closet.
175,ep132,"It's okay, I guess."
176,ep132,-And that's the bath.
177,ep132,"-Oh, I love that there's a separate tub from the shower."
178,ep132,This is definitely going to be my domain.
179,ep132,"You have your downstairs, I have my master bath."
180,ep132,-That's right.
181,ep132,Go ahead.
182,ep132,All right.
183,ep132,"And I think you guys are going to love, love, love -the roof deck."
184,ep132,-Is this the roof?
185,ep132,Is there a rooftop there?
186,ep132,This is the roof deck.
187,ep132,Okay. this is beautiful.
188,ep132,"-Oh, wow."
189,ep132,"Oh, my Gosh."
190,ep132,-Isn't this amazing?
191,ep132,Yeah. you get city skyline views.
192,ep132,What do you think?
193,ep132,I like it.
194,ep132,I say we cut the check.
195,ep132,You want to make an offer?
196,ep132,-Do you?
197,ep132,-There is a lot of things we need to consider.
198,ep132,"We're already at 649, and the kitchen, the painting."
199,ep132,-This is so typical.
200,ep132,I know.
201,ep132,There's still so much to talk about.
202,ep132,I think you guys should go downstairs and discuss it.
203,ep132,-All right.
204,ep132,"-Okay, thank you."
205,ep132,Paul was not chatty today.
206,ep132,"So when he says something like, ""Oh, maybe we should just write a check,"" it, kind of, goes in one ear, and out the other, because I've heard him say it before."
207,ep132,I really have no idea what Paul's thinking.
208,ep132,He didn't really say much.
209,ep132,And it's get s a little frustrating because he's going to tell me everything tonight.
210,ep132,"I mean, the closet space, maybe we can get creative with it."
211,ep132,"Well, something's definitely going to need to be done."
212,ep132,We're going to have some major closet issues.
213,ep132,So why didn't you say all this to Alex when we were in there?
214,ep132,I feel like that's more between us.
215,ep132,"So there agent, Alex, takes matters into her own hands, and finds them another place in the city."
216,ep132,"This one's cheaper, well, with a trade-off."
217,ep132,"Oh, wow."
218,ep132,"I know the neighborhood isn't ideal, especially, with all the construction going on, but I do think the house is worth a look."
219,ep132,"Janese and Paul want to buy right in Philadelphia, and she wants a low price, so they can save for their future together."
220,ep132,"Oh, wow."
221,ep132,Lot of construction.
222,ep132,"Yeah, and..."
223,ep132,Right on the train tracks.
224,ep132,"It's not the best, but..."
225,ep132,"I mean, look at it, it's new."
226,ep132,"At $464,900, I needed to see this house."
227,ep132,"The only thing is the location is basically a construction zone, and it's not really walkable at all for me."
228,ep132,"-Hi, guys."
229,ep132,"Hi, Alex."
230,ep132,How was the drive over?
231,ep132,"It was eventful, I mean, there's a lot of construction."
232,ep132,-Yeah. a lot of construction.
233,ep132,"But I think for the price, it's definitely worth taking a look."
234,ep132,"It's 2,900 square feet, four full bedrooms."
235,ep132,And you're still relatively close to Center City.
236,ep132,"It has a lot of the aesthetic that Janese really likes, but for Paul, it doesn't have that, sort of, Italian feel that he really likes."
237,ep132,"Oh, wow, Look at the high ceiling."
238,ep132,"Yeah, the celling's really high."
239,ep132,-Gives you...
240,ep132,You have crown molding.
241,ep132,Look at all of this space in the kitchen.
242,ep132,Isn't this amazing?
243,ep132,"So much countertop space, I could see doing a ton of baking, a ton of cooking."
244,ep132,"It's all modern and new, which isn't, you know, my speed as much as it is yours."
245,ep132,What are you going for then?
246,ep132,"A little more darker tones, browns, reds."
247,ep132,"Paul, do you think you can achieve a little bit more of the Italian vibe that you're going for if you change the wall color, 'cause this is pretty neutral."
248,ep132,Maybe I would like the wall colors a little better if the floors were a little darker.
249,ep132,"Remember again, Paul, though, at $464,900, -you have a ton of room..."
250,ep132,-A lot of room to work with.
251,ep132,I don't know that I can get Paul onboard with this.
252,ep132,"It's very modern, there's not a lot of character that he looks for, and I'm definitely not painting any walls red."
253,ep132,What do you think of this room?
254,ep132,"There's not a ton of space to be able to, I mean, no artwork, certainly no mural."
255,ep132,Why couldn't you?
256,ep132,You could literally use this wall here.
257,ep132,"But I mean, by the time you put a desk, and maybe a couch, it's a little too small for my space."
258,ep132,Is it?
259,ep132,We will find Paul an office.
260,ep132,You guys said voice my opinion.
261,ep132,"-Yeah, we want to hear it."
262,ep132,"-Yeah, that's great, Paul."
263,ep132,"I hate the color schemes, I hate the finishes."
264,ep132,This house is aesthetically for Janese.
265,ep132,"I like a lot of dark colors, browns."
266,ep132,"I want to hear about what you don't like, Paul, I do."
267,ep132,"I don't want to get an email, like, tomorrow."
268,ep132,"And this could be a guest bedroom or your office, Janese, or..."
269,ep132,"Oh. do like that it's at the back of the house so it wouldn't be right next to the train, if I have to make this my office."
270,ep132,"Wow, yeah."
271,ep132,"Really close with your neighbors, so."
272,ep132,"Yeah, we'll put curtains up, so it'll be fine."
273,ep132,Okay. you do get a lot of natural light.
274,ep132,"-Even though there is wall, right?"
275,ep132,Yeah. you have another full bathroom right here.
276,ep132,"I definitely like it, but the tile's just a little, ""eh""."
277,ep132,You have room to customize.
278,ep132,We do.
279,ep132,"And up here, you have an entire main suite."
280,ep132,Wow. you're high up.
281,ep132,"So I feel like you're, sort of, clearing."
282,ep132,"We're not really clearing the train tracks, -we do have a view of downtown."
283,ep132,-You get a lot of...
284,ep132,You do have a view of downtown.
285,ep132,-And you get a lot of light.
286,ep132,That's nice.
287,ep132,"Yeah. wow, there's a ton of space in here."
288,ep132,"You could even potentially put some stuff in here, too."
289,ep132,Share a closet with you?
290,ep132,Cool. wow.
291,ep132,But seasonal stuff.
292,ep132,I wouldn't share a closet with Janese if I was paid.
293,ep132,"You probably wouldn't be able to, because I would eventually take the closet space, anyways."
294,ep132,-Disaster. definitely a really nice closet.
295,ep132,"Yes, so far, my favorite part of the house."
296,ep132,"Perfect, that's all we need."
297,ep132,The main bath is going to be right up your alley.
298,ep132,This is exactly what I'm talking about.
299,ep132,Look at how much space there is.
300,ep132,I hate the color but...
301,ep132,"I do think this definitely has, like, the luxury hotel feel that I want."
302,ep132,Luxury? I don't think so.
303,ep132,"If it had, like, big Italian finishes, we could match that."
304,ep132,"I mean, clean lines, I definitely like the lighting."
305,ep132,"Why don't we go see the roof deck, 'cause, Paul, I think you're really going to like it."
306,ep132,"Oh, wow, okay."
307,ep132,This is great.
308,ep132,You get a full view of downtown.
309,ep132,You get a full skyline view.
310,ep132,This is the nicest part of the house.
311,ep132,To you.
312,ep132,But I do think we could make it work.
313,ep132,I'm not a big fan of the house.
314,ep132,"I'm not, I mean..."
315,ep132,"It's just not your style, but that's okay."
316,ep132,You can grow to love it.
317,ep132,"A steakhouse, this certainly doesn't resemble."
318,ep132,He doesn't have to think it has steakhouse appeal.
319,ep132,"I really love this house, and I think that's what's going to matter more."
320,ep132,I can imagine it's going to be a long drive home.
321,ep132,But Paul isn't going down without a fight.
322,ep132,He wants to see another place before they make a final decision.
323,ep132,Though it means getting Janese to consider living outside Center City.
324,ep132,"It's $539,000, so it's little cheaper than some of the things we've been looking at."
325,ep132,So maybe we can get used to it up here.
326,ep132,It's not a bad area.
327,ep132,"Janese and Paul want a more permanent future together, buying a home in Philadelphia."
328,ep132,"Since they haven't been able to agree on the places they've seen in Center City, today, Paul's convinced Janese to take a look farther out in an area called Northern Liberties."
329,ep132,"We really are far outside of Center City, and I have no car, too."
330,ep132,"It's far outside of Center City, but it's $539,000, so it's a little cheaper than some of the things we've been looking at."
331,ep132,"I mean, Alex told us there was a lot to do, a lot to see, so maybe we can get used to it up here."
332,ep132,"Since moving to Philly, I've really become a Center City girl, and I really don't see myself wanting, or even needing a car."
333,ep132,"Well, at least, it's a freestanding house."
334,ep132,"Hi, Alex."
335,ep132,Nice to see you.
336,ep132,Good to see you.
337,ep132,The aesthetic meets them somewhere in the middle.
338,ep132,"It's got some really nice, modern vibes to it, while still maintaining some traditional features."
339,ep132,"You're not in Center City, but, I, personally, think that this is a wonderful neighborhood."
340,ep132,"It's filled with restaurants and bars, there's a grocery store a couple of blocks away."
341,ep132,"Oh, wow."
342,ep132,"Well-decorated. actually, really like the way they oriented this, because it makes it a little easier to visualize yourself being in."
343,ep132,-I like these chairs.
344,ep132,Thank you.
345,ep132,You're welcome.
346,ep132,"-Oh, thank you."
347,ep132,"-Yeah, of course."
348,ep132,"Weirdly enough, I think the furnished aspect of this house is definitely a positive for Paul."
349,ep132,He was able to really visualize himself living in here.
350,ep132,I actually really like the white contrasts with the dark hardware.
351,ep132,"I, actually, kind of, like it also."
352,ep132,"This really isn't Tuscan, but I would describe this as rustic."
353,ep132,"It's not rustic, it's more modern, traditional, definitely."
354,ep132,-In my head...
355,ep132,"-It's still beautiful, and I'm glad you like it."
356,ep132,This is the first of two outdoor spaces.
357,ep132,"Oh, this is adorable."
358,ep132,This is nice.
359,ep132,Isn't this fun?
360,ep132,"We certainly don't have a nice view from here, but..."
361,ep132,"When we're sitting, we won't notice that."
362,ep132,"Agree, I already have the best view in town."
363,ep132,-Aww. the right answer.
364,ep132,"-No, for sures."
365,ep132,This is nice.
366,ep132,"I mean, it's perfect."
367,ep132,I think I'm going to take you guys upstairs first.
368,ep132,"[Paul, Janese]"
369,ep132,"Okay. rooftop deck, but..."
370,ep132,"-Uh, yes, there is."
371,ep132,"-Oh, yeah?"
372,ep132,-Did you not look at this online?
373,ep132,He never looks at those.
374,ep132,"Janese, does he ever do his homework?"
375,ep132,-No. there is a rooftop deck here?
376,ep132,-Yes. many houses have we seen?
377,ep132,"-And you're still not with the program, Paul."
378,ep132,-All right.
379,ep132,"-Okay, so this is bath..."
380,ep132,-A shared bathroom -shared for these two bedrooms.
381,ep132,"-Okay. double sinks are nice, so..."
382,ep132,When you've got a couple of kids in each one.
383,ep132,"[Paul, Janese]"
384,ep132,Uh-huh. still have seven years of doing what we want.
385,ep132,Forward thinking.
386,ep132,Guest bedroom.
387,ep132,"Unbelievable, it's a big guest bedroom."
388,ep132,"-Great place for your mom, Janese, you know."
389,ep132,-Right. got a little wet bar up here.
390,ep132,"Wow, this is great, you get out of bed, you must have your coffee."
391,ep132,Exactly. you can easily clean your mug.
392,ep132,Exactly. don't have any excuses not to anymore.
393,ep132,"Whoa, first of all, that's, irrelevant, but..."
394,ep132,"Yeah, it's nice you don't have to go all the way down to the kitchen."
395,ep132,This is the main bedroom.
396,ep132,"Oh, wow."
397,ep132,-This is an oasis.
398,ep132,It is.
399,ep132,"Janese, you'll be happy to know that there are two large closets here."
400,ep132,"Now you're talking, we can work with this."
401,ep132,"Yeah, I'll take both of these."
402,ep132,-That's perfect.
403,ep132,I figured.
404,ep132,And the main bathroom here.
405,ep132,"Even the darkness of the hardware, I usually don't gravitate towards, but this is exactly your style."
406,ep132,"-I like this, it's nice."
407,ep132,"-Yeah. wow, look at how much space there is up here."
408,ep132,-This view is actually pretty nice.
409,ep132,-This view is great.
410,ep132,"I mean, you don't see Center City, obviously."
411,ep132,Right. it's such a nice open view.
412,ep132,But there's so much open space.
413,ep132,-Look at how much outdoor space there is up here.
414,ep132,"Jeez, yeah."
415,ep132,"And we haven't even seen all of the house yet, by the way."
416,ep132,-Oh. saved the basement for you.
417,ep132,"-Oh, wow, we still have more?"
418,ep132,-So we still have more house to see.
419,ep132,What do you think?
420,ep132,"Perfect, I mean, lot of storage."
421,ep132,"I mean, there's even space for a mural down here."
422,ep132,-Maybe. would that go?
423,ep132,"Maybe on, like, the big wall."
424,ep132,It depends on what we're going to do down here.
425,ep132,-We can do a small commissioned painting.
426,ep132,-Yeah. there.
427,ep132,-A commissioned painting.
428,ep132,-Right there.
429,ep132,-Maybe. want to buy this house?
430,ep132,I think we still have some things to talk about.
431,ep132,"I love this house, I could probably see us living here."
432,ep132,"We certainly have to talk about it, but I think we would write the check."
433,ep132,"I mean, it would happen tomorrow."
434,ep132,Paul is a true Aquarius.
435,ep132,"When he sees something he likes, he's going to jump on it."
436,ep132,This house is definitely the modern luxury style that I was looking for.
437,ep132,The only negative thing would be the location.
438,ep132,-We have a lot to discuss.
439,ep132,For sure.
440,ep132,"Definitely, you have a lot to discuss."
441,ep132,Thank you.
442,ep132,-I hope to hear from you soon.
443,ep132,-You definitely will be.
444,ep132,"I just got off the phone with Alex, and we really need to start putting some offers in."
445,ep132,Janese and Paul are planning a future together.
446,ep132,"First a house, then an engagement, if they can agree on a place."
447,ep132,What did you think about the row home closer to Center City?
448,ep132,The location is really great.
449,ep132,It's super walkable for everything that I need.
450,ep132,"It had a roof deck, it had a separate downstairs space."
451,ep132,The kitchen wasn't really my style.
452,ep132,The closets are not adequate.
453,ep132,"My concern is it being $649,900, because I want to make changes, and it doesn't give us a lot of wiggle room."
454,ep132,"Well, what about the new construction?"
455,ep132,"it was $464,900, and it was completely my style."
456,ep132,"Turnkey, ready to move in."
457,ep132,"It was big, it had, you know, immaculate roof deck."
458,ep132,"but I didn't like the development, I didn't like the interior."
459,ep132,That's your opinion.
460,ep132,"I love the house that we saw, that standalone house up in Northern Liberties."
461,ep132,I love that style of kitchen.
462,ep132,I love the basement where you can put a mural down there.
463,ep132,And then the rooftop deck was unbelievable.
464,ep132,"The closets were great, tons of space."
465,ep132,"The only thing is, it's so far outside of Center City."
466,ep132,[doorbell rings]
467,ep132,"Hi, Dad."
468,ep132,Welcome. do you think?
469,ep132,"Wow, nice."
470,ep132,What do you think of the place?
471,ep132,"It's no furniture yet, but movers come on Wednesday."
472,ep132,It looks good.
473,ep132,It looks good.
474,ep132,I like the kitchen.
475,ep132,So we ended up buying the row home.
476,ep132,"We got the keys about a week ago, and we're not quite moved in yet."
477,ep132,"Honestly, what won out was the location, and how practical it was."
478,ep132,It has a roof deck.
479,ep132,It really has everything that we wanted in the area that we wanted to be in.
480,ep132,"So the asking price for this house was $649,900, There was actually another offer for this house."
481,ep132,"So we immediately bumped our price to $5,000 over the asking price, and we made sure that we bought this house."
482,ep132,"Honestly, I'm a planner."
483,ep132,"He, kind of, just goes with the flow."
484,ep132,"I thought it was going to be a lot easier than what it was, but, eventually, we came together and worked it out."
485,ep132,"So we actually ripped out the carpet that was in the basement, and we're going to work on making the basement steakhouse-esque."
486,ep132,We'll see.
487,ep132,"When you come down the steps, the thing you want to do is you want the mural over here."
488,ep132,You want to see it.
489,ep132,I don't want to see it.
490,ep132,I definitely compromised the most on this house.
491,ep132,"The closet space is not adequate, and it's not as modern as I would like."
492,ep132,"I'm hoping that down the line, I can get custom built-up closets, we can modernize the kitchen, and do some things to make it more me."
493,ep132,-[cork pops]
494,ep132,-[both whoop]
495,ep132,That almost took my eye out.
496,ep132,"Sorry about that, I got excited."
497,ep132,"So, for me, it means everything to start our family and build a solid foundation."
498,ep132,"And, to me, buying a house with Janese, is a sign of commitment to Janese, and a commitment to our future together."
499,ep132,"All you got to do is get married, and everything's perfect."
500,ep132,"-There you go, see?"
501,ep132,-It's on you.
502,ep132,It's all lining up.
1,ep133,-This is...
2,ep133,"-Oh, my goodness."
3,ep133,...amazing. with help from mom is on the hunt in the D.C.
4,ep133,"suburbs. wants a lot of space since she has a newborn and works from home, but Verna's worried her daughter will overextend herself."
5,ep133,Five bedrooms?
6,ep133,"Oh, my God."
7,ep133,[Alesia laughs]
8,ep133,That's just so much space.
9,ep133,"She's trying to push Alesia and her agent toward a smaller, less expensive place."
10,ep133,-Where's my townhouse?
11,ep133,"-Well, we're..."
12,ep133,-I'm seeing a lot of grass.
13,ep133,-We'll get to your townhouse.
14,ep133,-I'm curious to see this ranch.
15,ep133,-I'm seeing a lot of grass.
16,ep133,I love my mom.
17,ep133,"I wanna take her opinion, but ultimately, this is my choice."
18,ep133,[doorbell rings]
19,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
20,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
21,ep133,Do you agree with what I had to say?
22,ep133,Talk to me in the comments.
23,ep133,Don't forget to like.
24,ep133,Don't forget to subscribe.
25,ep133,I am the Assistant Director of Communications for Digital Media at a labor union.
26,ep133,"And on the side, I have a video blog."
27,ep133,"Hey, look who's up?"
28,ep133,We gotta go downstairs and maybe get a snack.
29,ep133,I'm a single mom and I have a 10-month-old beautiful daughter named Jojo.
30,ep133,"I was living in Washington, D.C."
31,ep133,"But now being a mom, it was just crazy, all of the steps, not being able to find parking."
32,ep133,"So I kinda asked my mom, ""Hey, can we stay here -for a couple of months?"""
33,ep133,-I think...
34,ep133,I think I actually suggested that you guys come here to stay.
35,ep133,My mom's pretty great.
36,ep133,"I would say my mom is my mom first, but it is nice that I can talk to her like a friend."
37,ep133,"I've been saving up for this house and my mom graciously offered to help and so, you know, with that, of course, I have to take her opinion in."
38,ep133,I will definitely weigh in.
39,ep133,This is not something to be taken lightly for your first purchase.
40,ep133,So I'm gonna be looking in the D.C.
41,ep133,"suburbs. long as I'm close enough to the city within like a 30-minute drive, I'm good with that."
42,ep133,"-I'm willing to go up to $475,000, but I..."
43,ep133,"-Oh, my God."
44,ep133,That is way too high.
45,ep133,"I think you can get something around $350,000."
46,ep133,"Look, my mom has always been thrifty and there's nothing wrong with that, but I do think she might be in for a little bit of a rude awakening when it comes to what's actually available on the market right now."
47,ep133,"When you were born, I was in the midst of medical school."
48,ep133,"When we moved into the townhouse, I had just started my internship."
49,ep133,"You keep talking about, like, me looking at townhomes and things like that and the..."
50,ep133,My fear about a townhome is having to walk up and down the steps with Jojo.
51,ep133,"I would love to find a single-family home that's more ranch style, thinking about having a small child, having everything that I need all on one level..."
52,ep133,"Well, single-family homes have their advantages, but they also have their disadvantages being a lot of yard work."
53,ep133,"So I may have made being a single mom look easy, but it was tough."
54,ep133,"I do have a small dog, so I definitely wanna have a yard and I wanna have space for Jojo to play."
55,ep133,"I wanna have a kitchen that's updated, white cabinets..."
56,ep133,"They show every stain, every spot."
57,ep133,Wait until you see all her little fingerprints all over those white cabinets.
58,ep133,"I think focusing on what you actually need right now, three bedrooms, one for you, one for Jojo, one for me when I come to visit."
59,ep133,Where am I gonna put my office?
60,ep133,I'm honestly kinda feeling like four bedrooms isn't even so much a want as much as it is a need right now.
61,ep133,"I mean, I'm thinking long-term."
62,ep133,I feel like you're thinking very much so on the immediate.
63,ep133,"As you know, I have experience in purchasing homes which you feel like you want right now."
64,ep133,You are probably not gonna want the same thing three to four years from now.
65,ep133,You are hard-headed.
66,ep133,I think that I'm just a very assertive person.
67,ep133,But sometimes you don't listen to wisdom and experience.
68,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
69,ep133,They've traveled to the D.C.
70,ep133,area for the weekend and are meeting Alesia's agent at a house in Lanham.
71,ep133,"$419,000, five bedrooms?"
72,ep133,"Oh, my God."
73,ep133,That's just so much space though.
74,ep133,You're gonna have to keep all of that clean.
75,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
76,ep133,"-Hey, ladies."
77,ep133,How you doing?
78,ep133,Wow. is huge.
79,ep133,Split-level home...
80,ep133,Okay. don't really know what split-level means.
81,ep133,"Okay. you'll see as soon as you come -in the foyer area, okay?"
82,ep133,"Okay. are way more buyers than sellers right now, which has made the market extremely competitive."
83,ep133,We need to be open as far as what we look at.
84,ep133,It can be a struggle because Verna is very opinionated.
85,ep133,I try to direct my attention towards the buyer because they are gonna be the one signing the paper.
86,ep133,"So as soon as you come in here, you're gonna have to make an immediate decision as to what you wanna do, going up or down, all right?"
87,ep133,I was sort of looking for a ranch.
88,ep133,I do understand.
89,ep133,I do understand.
90,ep133,"It's a limited market right now -as to what we have to look at, all right?"
91,ep133,Okay. steps are not too bad.
92,ep133,It's hardwood.
93,ep133,It's nice and I like the fact that the floors are dark and I'm seeing a backyard so that's already a good sign.
94,ep133,Okay. is right here at the front of the house.
95,ep133,Mmm-hmm. have my white cabinets.
96,ep133,-[Alesia laughs]
97,ep133,Just don't forget Jojo.
98,ep133,Just think about her fingers all over everything.
99,ep133,Gonna have a lot of cleaning to do.
100,ep133,"Well, you know, it's my home and I am ready to clean it."
101,ep133,"Now, we have a nice deck."
102,ep133,"Oh, my God."
103,ep133,"Look at this backyard, more to cut."
104,ep133,We can have a swing set for Jojo.
105,ep133,Oshoon is gonna run out in this yard.
106,ep133,This is awesome.
107,ep133,I can see the barbecues.
108,ep133,I don't see that there will be much time for entertaining because you will be pushing a mower all weekend long.
109,ep133,-I can just hire someone.
110,ep133,-More expense.
111,ep133,"Would you do it, Matthew?"
112,ep133,"You could come over here and cut the grass here, right?"
113,ep133,"Yeah. we got Matthew onboard already, so..."
114,ep133,"No, that is not a service I provide."
115,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
116,ep133,So how many bedrooms are on this level?
117,ep133,-There's gonna be three on this floor.
118,ep133,Okay. right?
119,ep133,And then two full bathrooms on this floor as well.
120,ep133,So guests would use this bathroom.
121,ep133,"And with a small baby, definitely having a tub is a good thing, lots of homes now, I think, just have, like, showers."
122,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
123,ep133,This is...
124,ep133,"Seems cozy and it's close to the bathroom, so this might be a good mom bedroom."
125,ep133,-Check out this closet.
126,ep133,Yeah. out the closet.
127,ep133,I don't necessarily think that we need this much closet space.
128,ep133,"People who are coming to visit, they should just be living out of a suitcase as far as I'm concerned."
129,ep133,"Well, I'm gonna be coming to visit often, so I might need to have some things that would stay here."
130,ep133,All right.
131,ep133,This could be a room for Jojo maybe.
132,ep133,"Now, this will be considered your main bedroom."
133,ep133,Okay. loving this.
134,ep133,I just wanna note that this bathroom doesn't need any updating.
135,ep133,More white cabinets.
136,ep133,"Well, you know I love a white cabinet."
137,ep133,Yeah. we have a problem.
138,ep133,Okay. don't know.
139,ep133,I have a lot of clothes.
140,ep133,Okay. I just don't know if that's gonna work at all.
141,ep133,Let's take a look down at our lower level.
142,ep133,"Oh, God, this house is huge."
143,ep133,"Wow. of course, the living area."
144,ep133,The basement is pretty spacious for us.
145,ep133,-Great space to grow.
146,ep133,Mmm-hmm. about the cleaning?
147,ep133,Keeping it clean?
148,ep133,What year was this house built?
149,ep133,-This is 1973.
150,ep133,"-Oh, my God."
151,ep133,That is way too old.
152,ep133,"I mean, you..."
153,ep133,That comes with a whole 'nother host of maintenance issues.
154,ep133,I love my mom.
155,ep133,"I wanna take her opinion, but ultimately, this is my choice."
156,ep133,"This is my house and it's gonna be my space, but she can come visit."
157,ep133,"And now this, of course, would be -your ideal office space."
158,ep133,"Oh, wow."
159,ep133,All right?
160,ep133,You have your natural light coming in from the front.
161,ep133,This is actually perfect.
162,ep133,"I mean, it feels bright in here."
163,ep133,And is it more?
164,ep133,It sure is.
165,ep133,"-Oh, my gosh."
166,ep133,Bathroom here is gonna be on the right.
167,ep133,"Oh, wow."
168,ep133,Okay. this is a full bath.
169,ep133,"I mean, this is definitely an awkward..."
170,ep133,-Yeah. little awkward here.
171,ep133,-...bathroom. looks crazy.
172,ep133,"We would, of course, get more information and see exactly what's going on here."
173,ep133,So the downstairs is a little bit scary.
174,ep133,I'm slightly concerned.
175,ep133,"It looks like even though the upstairs is really updated, downstairs, it definitely looks like there's gonna be a couple of projects."
176,ep133,I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do all of that work and I really would like to find a home that was on one level.
177,ep133,This house is huge.
178,ep133,Correct. there are steps too.
179,ep133,Did not want steps.
180,ep133,"Now, the market is not right now in buyer's favors, so we have to take that in consideration, all right?"
181,ep133,Limited inventory...
182,ep133,"Remember, more space also comes with more expenses down the road."
183,ep133,"So Matthew's lined up a smaller, more move in ready home, but he can't please everyone."
184,ep133,-Where's my townhouse?
185,ep133,"-Well, we're..."
186,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
187,ep133,"Jessup, Maryland, have you ever been here?"
188,ep133,I don't think I've ever been to Jessup.
189,ep133,Alesia is looking for her first home in the D.C.
190,ep133,"suburbs and her mom has strong opinions on the type of place she should buy, low-maintenance and cheap."
191,ep133,"Three bedrooms, two and a half bath, $425,000, built in 1969 and you know how I feel about older homes."
192,ep133,I think the age of the home isn't really that important.
193,ep133,I think it's what the house looks like.
194,ep133,"Oh, I'm loving this."
195,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
196,ep133,Looks great from the outside.
197,ep133,-Hey. how are you?
198,ep133,Good. my townhouse?
199,ep133,"-Well, we're..."
200,ep133,-I'm seeing a lot of grass.
201,ep133,-We'll get to your townhouse.
202,ep133,-I'm curious to see this ranch.
203,ep133,-I'm seeing a lot of grass.
204,ep133,"You know, I really was looking for four bedrooms, but the curb appeal of this house is awesome."
205,ep133,For sure.
206,ep133,For sure.
207,ep133,So let's try to keep it to positive.
208,ep133,"$425,000, I believe, is a bit much."
209,ep133,"I want her to be able to get a house that she wants, that she can enjoy, but just not have to give up her entire life."
210,ep133,It is so hard to please these ladies.
211,ep133,"I mean, I can please either one."
212,ep133,"$425,000 is a reasonable price."
213,ep133,It's completely updated and it's about 30 minutes away from D.C.
214,ep133,"Oh, wow."
215,ep133,"This is really, really open."
216,ep133,Dark cabinets that I like.
217,ep133,Yeah. exactly the white kitchen I was looking for.
218,ep133,The floors are a little bit light.
219,ep133,I kind of prefer a little bit of a darker floor or maybe even like a gray.
220,ep133,The light floor is in contrast to the dark cabinets.
221,ep133,"It looks nice, though."
222,ep133,"At least it looks really updated and the finishes are definitely high quality, but I would probably wanna paint the cabinets."
223,ep133,"I'm just a little bit nervous because with Jojo and everything, I know that the kitchen is not gonna be this clean and then, people are being, like, entertained over there, like, while it's kind of a mess in here."
224,ep133,So I don't really know if I completely love the openness.
225,ep133,"The market is very difficult, so it's like I'm going up against two ladies and the market."
226,ep133,"Oh, wow."
227,ep133,This feels like a main bedroom.
228,ep133,"Oh, my goodness."
229,ep133,-Definitely. love the space here.
230,ep133,-Yes. enough space there for a sitting area.
231,ep133,Yeah. is only gonna get older and she's gonna be more and more independent.
232,ep133,And so it'll be nice to have space in the home that really is just mine.
233,ep133,-Okay. is amazing.
234,ep133,"Oh, my goodness."
235,ep133,"I mean I don't know if we need the tree, but it's great that there's enough space for this and there's definitely still enough space for all of the clothes that I have now."
236,ep133,And the clothes that I will most certainly be acquiring.
237,ep133,"With the price of this house, I don't think you'll be acquiring too many more clothes."
238,ep133,"Oh, my goodness."
239,ep133,"This is really, really, really nice."
240,ep133,"Oh, and it's got the dark wood cabinets."
241,ep133,I could forgive the wood here in the bathroom.
242,ep133,"Let's take a look on the other side of the other bedrooms, -all right?"
243,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
244,ep133,Full bathroom.
245,ep133,I think it's really good-sized.
246,ep133,"I love the fact that it's a bathtub that'll really work for Jojo, makes it easier to bathe her and everything."
247,ep133,"Oh, wow."
248,ep133,This is a really nice-sized room.
249,ep133,There's an en suite here.
250,ep133,"Oh, I could use this room."
251,ep133,Yeah. I think that this would be a perfect room for you.
252,ep133,"For when I come and stay three, four, five weeks."
253,ep133,Okay. not get ahead of ourselves.
254,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
255,ep133,Oh. this is a nice-sized room.
256,ep133,"Okay. room is a little bit smaller, but this would be perfect for Jojo, I think."
257,ep133,"One more room to take a look at, a bonus room that you can also count as your office space."
258,ep133,This is nice.
259,ep133,This actually is exactly what I need when I'm thinking about an office and having all of this...
260,ep133,"-Oh, whoa."
261,ep133,Oh. I won't be shooting any videos while I'm doing laundry.
262,ep133,But I think that's a small thing to consider when you take everything else that we have here into consideration.
263,ep133,Let's go ahead and take a glance out at the backyard.
264,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
265,ep133,Ooh. not gonna lie.
266,ep133,I love this backyard.
267,ep133,I love the fact that we have tons of patio space.
268,ep133,I definitely think I could have a backyard barbecue and a party in this space.
269,ep133,I'm seeing a lot of grass mowing.
270,ep133,"Alesia, like most first-time home buyers, sees things with rose-colored glasses, but I'm here to make sure she sees the extra maintenance and the extra expense."
271,ep133,"It's so interesting that my mom keeps talking about the yard and everything because she was the one mowing our lawn when I grew up, so I don't see why she thinks I can't try to do it."
272,ep133,I love that everything is on one level.
273,ep133,"The main bedroom, the main bath is great."
274,ep133,"I mean, honestly, the openness just makes me a little bit nervous."
275,ep133,"It would be nice to have an additional living space or something, you know."
276,ep133,I still would like for her to see a townhouse or condo.
277,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
278,ep133,So Matthew lines up a place he hopes Verna can get onboard with.
279,ep133,-You found a townhouse for me.
280,ep133,I sure did.
281,ep133,I sure did.
282,ep133,Not a ton of parking.
283,ep133,Yeah. knew you'd say something about that.
284,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
285,ep133,[doorbell rings]
286,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
287,ep133,A little bit further away from D.C.
288,ep133,"than I would like to be, but Columbia is really, really nice."
289,ep133,"Three-beds, three-bath townhome built in 1989."
290,ep133,-Okay. liking that.
291,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
292,ep133,"Hey, Matthew."
293,ep133,-Saved a spot for you.
294,ep133,How you doing?
295,ep133,Yeah. God you saved this spot for me.
296,ep133,Yeah. found a townhouse for me.
297,ep133,I sure did.
298,ep133,I sure did.
299,ep133,-Not a ton of parking.
300,ep133,Yeah. knew you'd say something about that.
301,ep133,But you have your assigned spot.
302,ep133,"And it's listed for $365,000."
303,ep133,"Well, I like that price."
304,ep133,Like the price for it.
305,ep133,Excited about that too.
306,ep133,All right.
307,ep133,Let's take a look inside.
308,ep133,This home has been updated.
309,ep133,"She's getting a lot for it on which she wouldn't be paying, so I'm thinking that it's something that Alesia would be able to appreciate."
310,ep133,Behind this door is your half bath.
311,ep133,"Oh, that's convenient when you're coming in with groceries."
312,ep133,I'm coming in with groceries and I have to use the bathroom?
313,ep133,"Well, you put your groceries down and then you can come right over."
314,ep133,Okay. I like the fact that we have white cabinets and it looks pretty updated.
315,ep133,The kitchen has its own dedicated room.
316,ep133,What do you think of the floors?
317,ep133,I like the gray floor.
318,ep133,This is really nice.
319,ep133,-And then the dining area...
320,ep133,Yeah. the hardwood seems to go throughout.
321,ep133,You're seeing lots of consistency.
322,ep133,Nice fireplace.
323,ep133,It's definitely my style.
324,ep133,All right.
325,ep133,This is a nice-sized yard.
326,ep133,Okay. is not a yard.
327,ep133,"I mean, I like the green space out there."
328,ep133,I wish some of that greenery was in here.
329,ep133,"And you've got ample flowerbeds in here if you want a project, you can add some green to it."
330,ep133,This gives you outdoor space that's functional and practical.
331,ep133,"I love the positivity today, Verna."
332,ep133,I'm going for it.
333,ep133,So let's take a look at our bedrooms.
334,ep133,"You know, I really wanted that fourth bedroom."
335,ep133,I knew you'd have something to say about that.
336,ep133,Yeah. floating steps are a little bit tricky with a small child.
337,ep133,"This house is already reminding me of my place in Washington, D.C."
338,ep133,with having all of these stairs every time Jojo needs to change a diaper.
339,ep133,"I'm gonna have to go upstairs, grab something, if I forget something then I'm walking up and down the steps again."
340,ep133,"And with a small child and a dog, it's just a lot."
341,ep133,First bedroom here.
342,ep133,I think this will be enough room for Jojo because she has a crib here.
343,ep133,"And when she gets older, I think I see enough space for a twin bed."
344,ep133,And she could have a desk over here.
345,ep133,I don't know.
346,ep133,"I think that this room is a little bit tight, but I think it would work."
347,ep133,Okay. think the positivity is still on the up and rising.
348,ep133,Okay. get a little bit more space in here.
349,ep133,"Okay. mean, I guess if you were to stay with me, this would probably be your room."
350,ep133,Yeah. could work for me.
351,ep133,The bathroom that probably your guests will be using and you'd be taking care of Jojo in.
352,ep133,"This feels really modern, definitely my aesthetic."
353,ep133,-Where is my bedroom gonna be?
354,ep133,"Of course, our main bedroom here."
355,ep133,"Oh, wow."
356,ep133,Okay. is a nice-sized room.
357,ep133,Good closet space.
358,ep133,"Yeah. mean, the closet could be a little bit better, but I think it's closet space that I could probably make work."
359,ep133,Yeah. you got a nice en suite.
360,ep133,It looks like this countertop and cabinet has been updated.
361,ep133,Probably needs a little bit of work.
362,ep133,I think this would meet your needs.
363,ep133,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
364,ep133,"I mean, I think this could really work for you."
365,ep133,"I mean, I don't really know where I'd be working."
366,ep133,You do have some more space.
367,ep133,We'll make our way to the basement.
368,ep133,Oh. enough space to work.
369,ep133,"This gives you some flexibility because you do have the workspace down here that you can use now and they have this set up with a bed, so you can have guests down here."
370,ep133,"Oh, okay."
371,ep133,So we've got a full bath down here.
372,ep133,"Well, you know I like blue and the blue in the floor is calling my name."
373,ep133,Okay. really trying to be positive right now.
374,ep133,Positivity seems to be at an all-time high.
375,ep133,The price is good.
376,ep133,I taught Alesia to be wise with her money.
377,ep133,"Get what you need, a little bit of what you want, and try not to overspend."
378,ep133,The price is really nice.
379,ep133,I'm not hating this.
380,ep133,I definitely think it's an option.
381,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
382,ep133,"With the pressure on, can mom sell Alesia on a smaller, more practical home?"
383,ep133,We got four hours ahead of us.
384,ep133,And tons to talk about.
385,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
386,ep133,"With the clock ticking in this tight market, it's mom's last chance to convince Alesia that a cheaper, low-maintenance home is the way to go."
387,ep133,What did you think about the split-foyer?
388,ep133,Five bedrooms is a lot of space to keep clean.
389,ep133,"It still had steps and I wasn't necessarily looking for something with steps in the home, but there was tons of space in that house."
390,ep133,I do get the white kitchen and it was under a 30-minute drive to D.C.
391,ep133,"There was a bit of work that probably needed to be done in the basement, but I love the fact that it had a great backyard."
392,ep133,But I'm seeing you pushing a lawn mower the whole weekend.
393,ep133,"That's too much space, I still think."
394,ep133,The ranch was great.
395,ep133,All on one level.
396,ep133,Yes. was nice.
397,ep133,The primary bedroom was so good.
398,ep133,"I mean, that closet, that was amazing."
399,ep133,"The openness of the kitchen, not necessarily something that I was looking for."
400,ep133,A lot of yard.
401,ep133,"The townhome, you know, I..."
402,ep133,"Yeah. know you really like the townhome, cheapest one of all the options."
403,ep133,Net monthly payment would not be bad at all.
404,ep133,There was outdoor space and then...
405,ep133,Okay. on.
406,ep133,I gotta stop you there.
407,ep133,"The townhome, I think, inside, I liked it, but the outdoor space really wasn't what I was looking for at all."
408,ep133,I think that's a want that you have and I think we needed to be focusing on what you need.
409,ep133,It was enough space so that you could entertain.
410,ep133,"There were steps all throughout the house and, I mean, that house really did remind me of D.C."
411,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
412,ep133,[doorbell rings]
413,ep133,I'll take her.
414,ep133,-Thank you.
415,ep133,-All right.
416,ep133,I ended up going with the split-foyer.
417,ep133,"My mom kept saying that this house was too much space, too many rooms, but this home felt like a nice pairing of my wants and my needs and it gives me a little bit of room to grow."
418,ep133,"The home was listed for $419,000 and I ended up paying $440,000 for it."
419,ep133,Matthew kept telling us how competitive the market was and he wasn't lying.
420,ep133,"I mean, there were tons of offers on this house so I feel really, really lucky to have been able to get it."
421,ep133,"The white kitchen looks really nice, but I think you're still gonna have a problem with those fingerprints."
422,ep133,She's not running around just yet.
423,ep133,She's here in her high-chair so I think we've got some time to figure out how to make that work.
424,ep133,"I've only been in the home about three days and I think I've gotten a lot done, but I have so much more work to do."
425,ep133,"I haven't done anything with downstairs, but the idea of working on a home that's mine, that I really love, it doesn't feel that daunting."
426,ep133,[upbeat music playing]
427,ep133,"Go, go, go."
428,ep133,Oshoon is really enjoying the backyard.
429,ep133,I love the fact that I have great outdoor space here.
430,ep133,Oshoon has a great yard that he can kind of call his own.
431,ep133,Pushing the lawn mower would be good to help keep you in shape.
432,ep133,"I still think this is a lot of house, but I'm very excited for her."
433,ep133,I think this will be great for Alesia and Jojo.
434,ep133,I kind of feel like I finally have my own space and it's nice to have something that really is mine that then I can pass on to Jojo one day.
1,ep134,Can really see?
2,ep134,Is that a beehive?
3,ep134,All I see is liability.
4,ep134,"For Reeba, an attorney and a single mom, this home purchase is an investment that means everything to her and her daughter's future."
5,ep134,I want to make sure I build generational wealth for her.
6,ep134,"To do it, she's pushing for a bargain."
7,ep134,"But in Miami's pricey market, it's testing her relationship with her agent and best friend, Crystal."
8,ep134,The price is ridiculous.
9,ep134,There are rare occasions -where I can chime in and actually be right.
10,ep134,-Wow. this is a main road.
11,ep134,-Just take it into consideration.
12,ep134,-This is not a good start.
13,ep134,[doorbell rings]
14,ep134,[theme music playing]
15,ep134,"Hey, what's up?"
16,ep134,"Hey Crys, I'm good, how are you?"
17,ep134,"Good. right, well, I don't have Bella."
18,ep134,Are you free right now?
19,ep134,Yes. you on your way?
20,ep134,"-All right, perfect, perfect."
21,ep134,Yeah. going to come over and kick it right now.
22,ep134,I am an insurance defense attorney.
23,ep134,I am a single mom.
24,ep134,-Hey boo!
25,ep134,"-Hey, how are you?"
26,ep134,I'm great.
27,ep134,I am looking for a home because I've been living with my mom for about a year now.
28,ep134,"It's been amazing, but there's not a lot of privacy."
29,ep134,Purchasing a home to represent just having a beautiful home for my daughter to grow up in and run around in the backyard and play around in.
30,ep134,-So how's Mom?
31,ep134,-She's wonderful.
32,ep134,"My agent is actually my best friend, Crystal."
33,ep134,We have been friends since the ninth grade.
34,ep134,Sometimes she's a little pushy.
35,ep134,"And I would agree because she can be a very much of a know-it-all, she sometimes doesn't know when to stop."
36,ep134,"There are rare occasions where I can chime in, in our conversation, -and actually be right."
37,ep134,"-Wow. without a, you know, without a thesis behind it."
38,ep134,I did want to show you a listing that actually just popped up.
39,ep134,"It's a reasonable price, you know, it's with..."
40,ep134,Reasonable to me or reasonable to you?
41,ep134,-It's with...
42,ep134,"It's... our journey, we actually had a bit of a slip-up."
43,ep134,"Because, being that this is a very competitive market in Miami, I felt like she could afford more."
44,ep134,-I felt like-- -And I felt like she was counting my pockets.
45,ep134,She decided to go and talk with another agent.
46,ep134,-I did.
47,ep134,-And the other agent told you what?
48,ep134,Okay. she told me the same things that Crystal told me.
49,ep134,It was like a switch going off in my head.
50,ep134,"I'm like, ""Yeah, Crystal did know what she was talking about."""
51,ep134,So Reeba's back with Crystal.
52,ep134,And has agreed to be at least a little more flexible on price.
53,ep134,"We've kind of talked about, kind of, where you want to be which is around..."
54,ep134,-Probably like 300?
55,ep134,-Yeah. you realize we're in Miami.
56,ep134,-Mm-hmm. it's super-hot.
57,ep134,"I can afford more, but I don't want to spend a lot of money."
58,ep134,"$400,000 is scary to me."
59,ep134,I'm a frugal person.
60,ep134,The most important person in my life is my daughter.
61,ep134,And I want to make sure I build generational wealth for her.
62,ep134,"I already have an investment property that I bought about two years ago, and when I do purchase this home and I want to maybe rent it out in the future, I would like it to have a nice return of investment."
63,ep134,"You know, I don't mind a fixer-upper."
64,ep134,"You know, a little paint, a little elbow grease never hurt anybody."
65,ep134,"Do you realize that you're full-time working, -you have Bella."
66,ep134,"My husband and I, we have rental properties of our own."
67,ep134,"So, understanding the work that actually goes into a true fixer-upper, why not go look at something that's ready to move in."
68,ep134,It has to be ranch-style.
69,ep134,"So, flat, one level."
70,ep134,I want all of the rooms to be on one side of the house.
71,ep134,"Because I, you know, I want my daughter to be near me."
72,ep134,I need impact windows.
73,ep134,"Formal dining room is really important to me, because I want to be able to have, like, the nice Thanksgivings, nice Christmas dinners at my home."
74,ep134,And it needs to be within a five mile radius of Mom.
75,ep134,I think that that's something that we can work with.
76,ep134,That's all I ask.
77,ep134,"With the pressure on to find Reeba the wealth-building investment she wants, today, Crystal's found a home with good rental potential."
78,ep134,"I want to, kind of gain her trust back and let her know that I'm listening to her."
79,ep134,I wanted to show Reeba this home in particular because the value on this home is really great.
80,ep134,"When it comes to rentability, this is a split floor plan, which is what most Miami families are looking for."
81,ep134,"-It, um..."
82,ep134,I'm loving the homes over here.
83,ep134,"'Cause you see, it's close to your mom, right?"
84,ep134,-Close to my mom.
85,ep134,We're gonna turn in right here.
86,ep134,-Crystal. is a main road.
87,ep134,Into this-- And I have a one-year-old.
88,ep134,I mean...
89,ep134,And there's no gate.
90,ep134,-Just take it into consideration.
91,ep134,I'm trusting your judgement but this is not a good start.
92,ep134,"Oh, look at how fast people are driving."
93,ep134,[car honks]
94,ep134,"Come here, follow me."
95,ep134,Mm-hmm. you see that they've already built posts here?
96,ep134,Okay. can place a fence.
97,ep134,-And you can section this off with a gate.
98,ep134,Okay. house doesn't really require anything for her to do outside of placing a fence eventually.
99,ep134,"Ultimately, this home, all she'd have to do is move in her furniture and begin her life with her daughter."
100,ep134,They do have the accordion shutters.
101,ep134,"Okay. don't have to worry about hauling them, -putting them on..."
102,ep134,Yeah. them in.
103,ep134,Okay. look at the landscaping.
104,ep134,Look how nice this is.
105,ep134,-And I really like these columns.
106,ep134,Let's see.
107,ep134,All right.
108,ep134,Oh this is cute!
109,ep134,Right? like the lighting.
110,ep134,"Yeah, it has all recessed lighting, which is nice 'cause it's updated."
111,ep134,"Ooh, I could put a cute little formal something here, -in this little family room."
112,ep134,-And your dining table here.
113,ep134,It'd be very nice.
114,ep134,"This kitchen, it's very modern."
115,ep134,I like the fact that the appliances are updated.
116,ep134,The backsplash...
117,ep134,"I actually like the color combo on the backsplash, it's very pretty."
118,ep134,And this countertop is cute.
119,ep134,"Yeah, it's, it's cute."
120,ep134,That's what I'd call this kitchen.
121,ep134,"Reeba, this is completely modern."
122,ep134,"Okay, but it's..."
123,ep134,it's tiny though.
124,ep134,"-It's modern, but it's tiny."
125,ep134,-You didn't say you wanted a big kitchen.
126,ep134,You don't even cook!
127,ep134,What do you need -a large kitchen for?
128,ep134,-I didn't say I want a big kitchen but it's just so tiny.
129,ep134,"What? think that the kitchen suffices for what it is that she needs every day, and it's within her price point."
130,ep134,"I feel like she does, sort of expect me to read her mind."
131,ep134,"A lot of times when we go into these homes, she's like, "" Well, Crystal, how could you not know?"""
132,ep134,"And I'll be like, ""Well, you didn't say you wanted this, and the whole point of us, you know, working together again is that I listen to you."""
133,ep134,So this would be the main bedroom.
134,ep134,"Oh, this is very cute."
135,ep134,And it does have a really nice en suite.
136,ep134,It's really updated.
137,ep134,I love this shower.
138,ep134,Yeah. though there's no tub.
139,ep134,"There isn't, but look how big this is."
140,ep134,I think that this is a really nice main bedroom.
141,ep134,And it's all the way on the other side of the house.
142,ep134,"I mean, Bella's super-fast."
143,ep134,A little track star in the making for sure.
144,ep134,Okay. this'll be your full second bathroom.
145,ep134,But there's no tub.
146,ep134,So that means there's no tub in the entire house.
147,ep134,We're talking about me bathing my one-year-old who loves bubble baths.
148,ep134,So she's not ever going to be able to take a bubble bath because I got a house with no tub.
149,ep134,But we can place one in.
150,ep134,"The lack of bathtub is not a ""deal breaker,"" But at 340, I do not want to spend any additional money on something like a bathtub."
151,ep134,-This is another bedroom.
152,ep134,"Good size, I think."
153,ep134,Right? it is.
154,ep134,-And this bedroom here...
155,ep134,Oh. was thinking of this room for Bella.
156,ep134,-It makes me so happy to be in here.
157,ep134,"Yeah. then, where would I be?"
158,ep134,All the way on the other side of the house?
159,ep134,"I want my baby to be, like, right next to me, you know?"
160,ep134,But then you have to think about other families that you might rent this home out to.
161,ep134,A lot of them do like the split floor plans.
162,ep134,You're right.
163,ep134,-And you love return on investment.
164,ep134,-That I do.
165,ep134,-Because that's more money that you can spend on Bella.
166,ep134,You're right.
167,ep134,Then we're going to come out here to your lovely den area.
168,ep134,Okay. like it.
169,ep134,[bee buzzing]
170,ep134,Is that a beehive?
171,ep134,I see a thousand bees outside.
172,ep134,All I see is liability.
173,ep134,I am an insurance defense attorney.
174,ep134,"So I defend a lot of cases when it comes to slip and falls, trip and falls, dog bites."
175,ep134,"So, when I see things that are a potential liability or a potential danger, they worry me."
176,ep134,'Cause I think about getting sued and I don't want to get sued.
177,ep134,I will make sure that those bees are safely removed.
178,ep134,"So, let's go out."
179,ep134,So what do you think?
180,ep134,Look how big this is!
181,ep134,-It's cute.
182,ep134,-Right? near my mom.
183,ep134,I really don't like the fact that I'm on the opposite side of the house.
184,ep134,Bella...The of tubs...
185,ep134,-That can also easily be swapped out.
186,ep134,-Okay. expense.
187,ep134,The fence in the front is an absolute necessity.
188,ep134,"-So that's $2,000."
189,ep134,"Right. if we can negotiate on the price a little bit, so it doesn't hurt as much to pay for a fence."
190,ep134,I don't think I would necessarily want to come in at offering price for this one.
191,ep134,I'm not a fan of the price.
192,ep134,"So Crystal finds a house that might be the cheaper deal, but it may need more work than Reeba's looking for."
193,ep134,And this gate is a mess.
194,ep134,You said you wanted a fixer-upper.
195,ep134,No curb appeal.
196,ep134,-But also a little curb appeal.
197,ep134,-So look.
198,ep134,[dog barks]
199,ep134,"I think I, kind of looked at that before."
200,ep134,-That house?
201,ep134,-Yeah. not going to say when I looked at it.
202,ep134,Right. we all know.
203,ep134,"After firing and re-hiring best friend, Crystal, as her agent, Reeba's holding out for a bargain that can build equity for herself and her daughter."
204,ep134,"So, today, Crystal's lined up a fixer-upper at a low price."
205,ep134,It's right by your mom.
206,ep134,Literally she could walk to your house.
207,ep134,Okay. gate is a mess.
208,ep134,"Listen, -you said you wanted a fixer-upper."
209,ep134,No curb appeal.
210,ep134,"Yeah, I did want a fixer-upper, but also a little curb appeal."
211,ep134,"Listen, it's my job to make dreams come true."
212,ep134,-Okay. that's what I do.
213,ep134,"-Miss I-can-handle-anything, right?"
214,ep134,-[Reeba laughs]
215,ep134,And it has a fence for Bella.
216,ep134,The fence is raggedy though.
217,ep134,"You can paint it, right?"
218,ep134,Mm-hmm. DIY?
219,ep134,"Okay, the door clearly doesn't work."
220,ep134,-[Reeba laughs]
221,ep134,"Warning. door, okay."
222,ep134,"-It's not broken, it's heavy."
223,ep134,[Reeba laughs]
224,ep134,[door closes]
225,ep134,This is nice.
226,ep134,-Natural lighting.
227,ep134,"-Natural lighting, which you know I love."
228,ep134,-But they're definitely not hurricane impact.
229,ep134,-No. -But they did have shutters.
230,ep134,"-See? you know, I would eventually like to -switch these out for hurricane impact."
231,ep134,Swap it out.
232,ep134,-Mm-hmm. my...
233,ep134,"Look, it's your dream kitchen!"
234,ep134,It is what you love.
235,ep134,"Is this my dream, too?"
236,ep134,Listen-- Is this my dream?
237,ep134,"-Your dream is to do DIY, right?"
238,ep134,The 319 price tag is very appealing to me.
239,ep134,"If I do the renovations, I can get a nice return of my investment."
240,ep134,Reeba is very busy.
241,ep134,"As an attorney, she works pretty much around the clock."
242,ep134,"And then, she is also a full-time mom of a toddler."
243,ep134,"I understand how much time that a fixer-upper takes, and I feel like she's not giving it enough credit."
244,ep134,The fact that it's going to take a lot of work if she did decide to take on a fixer-upper.
245,ep134,"-This is a Florida room, right?"
246,ep134,"-Yes, yes."
247,ep134,"-Look at that, a den."
248,ep134,"-You know, so that's perfect."
249,ep134,-A den area.
250,ep134,"-So I can put, like, my TV and my sectional here."
251,ep134,"And then I can make the front a formal dining area, -which you know I love!"
252,ep134,Whatever you want.
253,ep134,"-I must say, this is a beautiful backyard."
254,ep134,"-Look at this, look at this."
255,ep134,Lots of space.
256,ep134,"-This is very, very-- This is nice, this is serene."
257,ep134,There is space for Bella to do cartwheels and run all over and just-- -Yes.
258,ep134,"-You know, run all over the place."
259,ep134,"All right, let us see what these bedrooms look like."
260,ep134,-And they're all on one side.
261,ep134,"Very important, I do like that."
262,ep134,"So, this is a good size."
263,ep134,This is a cute room.
264,ep134,"This could be like an office maybe, or a guest room?"
265,ep134,Or Bella's room.
266,ep134,This room is a little bigger.
267,ep134,This is your main bedroom.
268,ep134,But it is a little small.
269,ep134,"-I'm going to have to change, like, the baseboards or-- Probably."
270,ep134,-Yeah. what do you think?
271,ep134,-Popcorn ceiling.
272,ep134,"Girl, that's gross."
273,ep134,-You can scrape that.
274,ep134,-You know what else is gross?
275,ep134,This bathroom.
276,ep134,Paint. it has a tub.
277,ep134,Look at this.
278,ep134,-It has your tub.
279,ep134,"And actually looks like they, they updated this."
280,ep134,I think that'll work out pretty nicely.
281,ep134,-You have three bedrooms on one side.
282,ep134,-That is right.
283,ep134,The backyard is perfect.
284,ep134,"But I feel like it's all going to add up between the windows, -the doors."
285,ep134,The doors.
286,ep134,"The appliances, the countertop, -that bathroom, which is a total mess."
287,ep134,"Right. know, she said she wasn't shy of a fixer-upper."
288,ep134,"But if she would just get new builds and maybe spend a little bit more money, she wouldn't have to worry about these compounding costs, because everything would already be done."
289,ep134,We could probably find something that's probably a little more put together for a bit higher probably.
290,ep134,-I don't know.
291,ep134,"-You don't know, that's the point."
292,ep134,I'm not a fan of this at all.
293,ep134,It's far away from civilization.
294,ep134,-And far from my mom.
295,ep134,-It is.
296,ep134,"Single mom Reeba's on a hunt for a low priced fixer-upper, that could also be a rental in the future."
297,ep134,"But today, her friend and agent Crystal's convinced her to see a turnkey place, because it has good investment potential in the popular suburb of Homestead."
298,ep134,Homestead's really up and coming.
299,ep134,The property values are increasing insanely.
300,ep134,"It has hurricane impact windows, which you'll see."
301,ep134,"-Oh, you know what I like."
302,ep134,-I do.
303,ep134,This is absolutely beautiful.
304,ep134,"Especially this, like, little accent wall they did here with the stone."
305,ep134,Yes. love it.
306,ep134,"-Let's talk about the price, though."
307,ep134,Yeah. it's a little bit out of your price range.
308,ep134,"Keep in mind, this is a five-three, plus an office."
309,ep134,"It is over 2,100 square feet."
310,ep134,"So, that's quite a bit of space."
311,ep134,"Last summer, this home sold for 220."
312,ep134,"-So, they completely revamped the inside."
313,ep134,-Wow! the market is shooting up.
314,ep134,That also tells you how much it's shooting up.
315,ep134,"409, though?"
316,ep134,-Especially in Miami.
317,ep134,I can spend more.
318,ep134,I just don't want to spend more.
319,ep134,I don't want to spend all of my income for the month on a house because it's pretty and it looks nice.
320,ep134,"Even though the home is something that's outside her comfort zone, it has what she needs, which is three bedrooms, two bathrooms, completely on one side."
321,ep134,"Then you also have a two-one, on the other side."
322,ep134,"You can wall off one side and then rent it out in the future to two separate families, honestly."
323,ep134,-This is absolutely beautiful.
324,ep134,Right? I love the floor.
325,ep134,"And the kitchen, oh!"
326,ep134,With new appliances.
327,ep134,Stainless steel appliances.
328,ep134,Stainless steel.
329,ep134,Backsplash. can see myself entertaining in this kitchen.
330,ep134,"I'm glad you said entertaining because we know that cooking is not going to happen, right?"
331,ep134,-[Crystal laughs]
332,ep134,"-Exactly, exactly."
333,ep134,And a pool.
334,ep134,When it comes to liability...
335,ep134,Yes. not loving this at all.
336,ep134,But keep in mind that you can have a pool fence.
337,ep134,"And even if you don't want to put a pool fence up right away you have this, which is already this screened-in patio."
338,ep134,"-Yeah. man, this is really nice."
339,ep134,"Right? love the landscaping, I love the trees."
340,ep134,"So, we'll go ahead and start on this side."
341,ep134,This is the bedroom and it leads to the outside.
342,ep134,"Oh. you did in the future want to rent it out, you could literally rent out this entire side."
343,ep134,"You're telling me about all this and it all sounds great, but then I remember the fact that this is 409 and I shudder."
344,ep134,"I know, but look how big this bathroom is."
345,ep134,Mm-hmm. can be Bella's room.
346,ep134,-Right? yeah.
347,ep134,I could imagine this being pink.
348,ep134,These bedrooms are really...
349,ep134,Really nice size.
350,ep134,Nice size.
351,ep134,-Is the price making a little more sense?
352,ep134,-It is making sense.
353,ep134,"This main bedroom here, huge, right?"
354,ep134,It is huge.
355,ep134,"And it has, like, an extra little room off the side."
356,ep134,"Right. really like it, but I do not like the fact that this en suite bathroom, is the bathroom that guests are going to use for the pool."
357,ep134,"I think it's pretty nice, given the fact that it is updated, you know."
358,ep134,"At the end of the day, you don't have to worry about really putting any money into it."
359,ep134,This would be Bella's bathroom.
360,ep134,It's nice.
361,ep134,This is already updated.
362,ep134,You don't have to worry about touching a thing.
363,ep134,"Even though, you know, I don't mind a little fixer-upper."
364,ep134,This is absolutely beautiful.
365,ep134,"But, it's entirely too far from my mom, and the price is ridiculous."
366,ep134,But you will not have to do a thing.
367,ep134,And this is a home that you probably wouldn't grow out of.
368,ep134,"And then if you didn't decide to stay here, you could totally, like, rent this place out."
369,ep134,I don't want to be house-poor.
370,ep134,But you get a lot of value for the price of this house.
371,ep134,I have to give Crystal some leeway.
372,ep134,"You know, I have to trust her judgement."
373,ep134,-You're going to have to make a decision soon.
374,ep134,Okay. there's nothing left on the market.
375,ep134,You're absolutely right.
376,ep134,"Hey, guys!"
377,ep134,Say hi.
378,ep134,"Single mom Reeba's been searching the Miami area for a house with her best friend and agent, Crystal."
379,ep134,"In this fast-moving market, she needs to make a decision soon."
380,ep134,There was the traditional updated.
381,ep134,I like that one.
382,ep134,Right? hit all of my points.
383,ep134,"It's a short distance from my mom, -but-- -And the modern kitchen that you'll never cook in."
384,ep134,And the modern kitchen.
385,ep134,"Um, but I didn't like the split floor plan."
386,ep134,But I think that home would rent super easy.
387,ep134,340 is a bit high for me to have to add the fence.
388,ep134,What about the...
389,ep134,the ranch fixer-upper?
390,ep134,I love the backyard.
391,ep134,And it had that cute little room in the back.
392,ep134,"That front gate, that would need to be repainted."
393,ep134,It would need new windows.
394,ep134,It had that super outdated kitchen.
395,ep134,"But I mean, I can put a little money into that and not feel bad about it, because it's on the low side of my price point."
396,ep134,There is potential for rental income in that home.
397,ep134,"To be, like, literally walkable distance to your mom, I can understand."
398,ep134,But that's a lot of work.
399,ep134,The Homestead pool home.
400,ep134,It's a beautiful home.
401,ep134,"The curb appeal, they had palm trees in the front."
402,ep134,I like the stone on the side of the door.
403,ep134,The windows are perfect.
404,ep134,"But, it's like nowhere near my mom, it is well above my price point."
405,ep134,"This will be a great investment for Bella down the line, because of the potential for rental income."
406,ep134,"So, when a market's super-hot still, we need to move it along, like, asap."
407,ep134,[doorbell rings]
408,ep134,"Uh-uh, Bella, don't do that, oh!"
409,ep134,What you doing?
410,ep134,I decided to purchase the fixer-upper.
411,ep134,It just felt like the right home for me.
412,ep134,"It has the perfect backyard, and it's super close to my mom."
413,ep134,[child cooing]
414,ep134,"-Oh, baby, baby, you're going to have some fun."
415,ep134,-She probably wants a chip.
416,ep134,Having my own space has been good.
417,ep134,"I mean, but it's a little lonely."
418,ep134,"Honestly, I'm still at my mom's house a lot."
419,ep134,"But, now I'm going home after I'm in my mom's house every day."
420,ep134,Hi. how are you?
421,ep134,"Oh, thank you so much."
422,ep134,"The listing price was $319,900."
423,ep134,"I ended up paying $320,000 for the house."
424,ep134,"I believe this home was a good investment, I didn't reach my price limit, which means I have a little more money to play around with on the back end."
425,ep134,And I can put money into a college fund for my daughter.
426,ep134,And I get to customize the home the way I want to.
427,ep134,You painted the fence yourself?
428,ep134,"-Oh, no, of course--"
429,ep134,-[both laugh]
430,ep134,"I started to paint all the rooms, the gate is fixed."
431,ep134,I'm planning on changing out the doors.
432,ep134,I definitely want to change out the countertops and put a nice backsplash.
433,ep134,-This is really nice.
434,ep134,-I like it.
435,ep134,It was great working with my best friend as my agent.
436,ep134,"I must say, we started off a little rocky, but I don't think I would have had such a great process with anybody but her."
437,ep134,I do feel like Reeba made the choice that was best for her.
438,ep134,"Homes in this area have already raised between 10 and 20,000 since she closed."
439,ep134,I definitely believe that this was a great investment for her and Bella's future.
440,ep134,"Okay, good."
441,ep134,"I like, I like how that looks."
442,ep134,"I envision having people over, sitting at the table, having a good time, having drinks."
443,ep134,It's going to be a great time.
444,ep134,[all laugh]
445,ep134,"Run, Bella, run."
446,ep134,Run.
1,ep135,amazing. Big
2,ep135,windows. -I love the natural
3,ep135,"light. Yeah. having to move twice in under a year for Daniel's job, Leah thinks she should be the one to decide on their new home in"
4,ep135,Kansas. I'm not loving the
5,ep135,carpet. It's a little shag for my
6,ep135,"taste. I don't mind it,"
7,ep135,though. It's just not what I would have
8,ep135,"chosen. At this point, it's time that I get a little something that I"
9,ep135,want. And she wants something
10,ep135,"grand. Look at this tub, it's kind of like a Roman"
11,ep135,bath. The house that I grew up in was
12,ep135,"beautiful. We didn't live a charmed life like you kind of thing,"
13,ep135,"but... I grew up in a smaller house, much more"
14,ep135,modest. My dream is the closet from Princess Diaries
15,ep135,"2. Ah, it's"
16,ep135,huge. It's
17,ep135,"just... I have that feeling like, it's more than we"
18,ep135,need. -[doorbell
19,ep135,rings] -[theme music
20,ep135,"playing] Can you make the eggs, like brown, like I like"
21,ep135,them? That's
22,ep135,disgusting. I'm a product manager for a lighting
23,ep135,company. I am a digital
24,ep135,marketer. And we met through a dating
25,ep135,app. He was the only guy to actually walk me to my car and open my door for me and that chivalry went a very long
26,ep135,"way. Just make sure that if you put the dishes away, you stack the forks"
27,ep135,properly. I didn't know there was a right or wrong way to stack
28,ep135,"forks. Well, you, like, either just throw them in or they all can like"
29,ep135,lay. So I think we both see life in a different
30,ep135,"perspective. Sometimes, he's a little too laid-back for"
31,ep135,"me. I can just be so particular and, you know, very much want to be on time"
32,ep135,and... Very
33,ep135,"particular. In our wedding vows, I literally said that I would do the majority of the dishes, so that way you don't have to get yelled at for doing it"
34,ep135,incorrectly. It's
35,ep135,true. We've moved a lot for his
36,ep135,"job. I grew up in Southern California, and then within a week of us getting married, had to move to New Jersey for his"
37,ep135,job. We then moved to Kansas for his job
38,ep135,again. I've uprooted my life now twice for
39,ep135,"him. Now that we've been here for about a year, we are at this point where we really do want to start having"
40,ep135,"kids. However, I am not willing to start a family until I have a"
41,ep135,home. I feel like you look at the high end of our price
42,ep135,range. Because
43,ep135,they're... they're
44,ep135,finished. I want a finished
45,ep135,"house. Yeah, but maybe you can find a good deal like the lower"
46,ep135,end... I'm not shopping for a deal on a
47,ep135,"home. The thing we disagree on the most, I think, is"
48,ep135,"price. I'd really kind of want to max out at the 500,000"
49,ep135,range. That money can be used towards something
50,ep135,"else. And to me, whether it can be spent on Puddles or future"
51,ep135,kids. I get
52,ep135,it. I love how frugal you
53,ep135,"are. However, what are you compromising"
54,ep135,on? We could spend around
55,ep135,"600,000. I really just want to make sure that, you know, whatever kind of home we're looking for is already at my"
56,ep135,standards. I grew up in a six-bedroom
57,ep135,home. I would love a house that has five bedrooms
58,ep135,plus. I love having the extra
59,ep135,"space. I had a full basketball court at the house I grew up in, and a full Olympic-sized"
60,ep135,pool. I had a separate room for
61,ep135,dress... You are a privileged
62,ep135,child. I would love a large closet if I
63,ep135,"could. My dream is the closet from Princess Diaries 2, like, where she walks in and she's like, ""I have my own mall,"" like, that is"
64,ep135,gold. It's more space to
65,ep135,clean. It's just more that we don't need and we can use that on something
66,ep135,"else. Oh, we definitely don't need it, but it'd be nice to have"
67,ep135,it. So I don't need a giant
68,ep135,house. I'm looking for something more
69,ep135,modest. I grew up in a smaller
70,ep135,house. I'm an only
71,ep135,child. So we didn't need as many
72,ep135,bedrooms. Much more modest
73,ep135,"upbringing. Yeah, much more"
74,ep135,"modest. I also want those kind of fix-her-up projects, and if the house has those fix-her-ups, it should be less 'cause I'll be spending that money later on fixing the home"
75,ep135,up. I love the craftsman style
76,ep135,home. It's very similar to the home I grew up
77,ep135,"in. Any sort of natural elements, wood,"
78,ep135,stone. I'm more of a modern contemporary type person I feel
79,ep135,like. So clean lines is pretty much what I'm looking
80,ep135,"for. At this point, I want the house of my dreams, -which is what you promised"
81,ep135,me... I
82,ep135,did. ...when said that we're
83,ep135,moving. I get some
84,ep135,"say. Whatever gets you through the day,"
85,ep135,"babe. Five bedrooms, close to 4,500 square"
86,ep135,feet. Mmm. the
87,ep135,"price? Uh, it's"
88,ep135,"$620,000. It sounds like a lot of house at a lot of"
89,ep135,"price. But if we're looking at starting a family soon, I think we're going to really appreciate the extra"
90,ep135,space. This is really
91,ep135,cute. I love the
92,ep135,neighborhood. I like the style of the
93,ep135,home. Some craftsman
94,ep135,elements. I like the little stone over
95,ep135,there. -Hey. it
96,ep135,doing? Pretty
97,ep135,good. Come on
98,ep135,in. Thank
99,ep135,you. -Wow. home is
100,ep135,amazing. I just feel like it's a lot of
101,ep135,home. I think this house is going to really speak to
102,ep135,Leah. I feel like the price speaks to her as
103,ep135,well. -That is a part of
104,ep135,it. -[both
105,ep135,chuckle] But I
106,ep135,like... I'm not shopping based on
107,ep135,price. So this is a traditional craftsman style
108,ep135,"home. It's got a lot more features to it, bigger feeling, with that comes a bigger price tag, which is probably a little nerve-racking for"
109,ep135,"Dan. Ultimately, I think, Leah is going to win out here as far as who gets"
110,ep135,what. She seems to have a very strong will of what she's
111,ep135,"wanting. Dan wants to be more go with the flow, with just consciousness on the"
112,ep135,price. Big
113,ep135,windows. I love the natural
114,ep135,"light. Yeah, it doesn't have that, like, modern sleek"
115,ep135,look. Big
116,ep135,kitchen. Built-in
117,ep135,oven. I
118,ep135,"know. Not a dual oven, but you"
119,ep135,know. Not that you need
120,ep135,it. It's just
121,ep135,nice. Lots of counter
122,ep135,"space. Lots of counter space, lots of"
123,ep135,"cabinets. I'd like 'em a little darker, but I'm okay with"
124,ep135,it. I did grow up in a larger
125,ep135,home. So I think I am looking to kind of recapture that
126,ep135,childhood. And this house has a lot to
127,ep135,offer. That really makes it that home that I think I'm trying to
128,ep135,"find. Really big yard, but it's not"
129,ep135,fenced. Not fenced
130,ep135,in. We definitely have to get a fence for
131,ep135,Puddles. I'm a little worried about the
132,ep135,backyard. Puddles might be running
133,ep135,away. There's some woods in that
134,ep135,area. But this is
135,ep135,good. This would be the main
136,ep135,bedroom. I'm not loving
137,ep135,this. I like that 'cause it's like a little sitting area and Puddles can jump on top of
138,ep135,"it. I just would prefer, I think, an actual"
139,ep135,couch. -Wow. at this
140,ep135,bathroom. Big
141,ep135,bathroom. Look at this
142,ep135,"tub. I like this side of the bathroom, but I'm not like the biggest fan of this side of the bathroom, just"
143,ep135,style. I feel like it doesn't
144,ep135,"match. I love this tub,"
145,ep135,though. Yeah.
146,ep135,"do. With the columns, it's kind of like a Roman"
147,ep135,"bath. And, oh, my goodness gracious, this closet is like enormously"
148,ep135,tall. There's definitely some tight space around
149,ep135,"here. You kind of have to, like, squeeze"
150,ep135,"by. Well, that's just where your clothes go for items -that you don't wear very"
151,ep135,"often. Yeah. gonna need, like, one of those"
152,ep135,hooks... Yeah. down your
153,ep135,clothes. That's a lot of
154,ep135,"clothes. Got the feeling like Dan is thinking this is a little too big, the price tag might be a little too big as"
155,ep135,"well. So, definitely concerned about"
156,ep135,that. This is a really good size
157,ep135,guestroom. They have their own walk-in
158,ep135,closet. So this would
159,ep135,"be... Not that I need them to stay here that long kind of thing, -but yeah, it's"
160,ep135,like... it's always
161,ep135,nice. -[Jason
162,ep135,chuckles] Does this house have walk-in closets in every
163,ep135,"room? I believe it does actually, even"
164,ep135,downstairs. -Yeah. love
165,ep135,that. [cheerful music
166,ep135,playing] You can see this basement's pretty
167,ep135,"large. I'm like soaking it all in 'cause there's so much space in this one, and I'm like, it seems like there's so much to clean and"
168,ep135,"maintenance. I told you, it's really nice,"
169,ep135,"though. Yeah. this is long-term,"
170,ep135,Dan. You're gonna be here for the rest of your
171,ep135,lives. A
172,ep135,"while. I do feel like I owe Leah a little bit, obviously we've traveled around the country a little bit, but it seems almost a little too big to"
173,ep135,me. It just always feels like it's more to clean and more to possibly break in the
174,ep135,"house. So I really don't think that Leah is going to be able to convince me on the $620,000 price for"
175,ep135,"this. Straight ahead, there you have your bathroom that all three bedrooms are going to be"
176,ep135,sharing. Yeah. is really nice 'cause the kids would
177,ep135,have... would be sharing
178,ep135,this. Little pet
179,ep135,door. I don't know if I like that for Puddles
180,ep135,exactly. I'm always wary of those 'cause I feel like other animals can get in the
181,ep135,house. Through the bathroom again is gonna be the third bedroom down
182,ep135,here. Another giant walk-in
183,ep135,"closet. See, I think you're coming around with this"
184,ep135,house. Yeah. grew up in a more modest
185,ep135,household. So I think walking into a home like this seems a little intimidating with its sheer
186,ep135,"size. But I think after moving twice for Dan's job, I am definitely looking for that larger"
187,ep135,home. It is a lot of
188,ep135,space. It's just a
189,ep135,"lot. It's really nice, but that's my problem is you're paying for the really"
190,ep135,"nice. So Jason finds Daniel a house with a lower price tag, but it's only 2,700 square"
191,ep135,"feet. Keep an open mind, it might be surprising as"
192,ep135,well. It's just smaller than what I was hoping
193,ep135,for. [cheerful music
194,ep135,"playing] For the most part, I think this is gonna be more along the lines of a home that you're interested"
195,ep135,"in. After moving twice in under a year for Daniel's job, he and Leah are finally settling down long-term and hoping to start a family in the Kansas City"
196,ep135,"suburbs. But she wants to spend big for a huge house, and he's fine with something more modest, which they're seeing"
197,ep135,today. It's listing at
198,ep135,"$405,000. Do you like"
199,ep135,that? It's four
200,ep135,"bedrooms. Keep an open mind, it might be surprising as"
201,ep135,well. It's just smaller than what I was hoping
202,ep135,for. [cheerful music
203,ep135,playing] I like the style on the
204,ep135,outside. Not loving all the
205,ep135,"stucco. Hey,"
206,ep135,guys. Hey.
207,ep135,on. Come on
208,ep135,in. -Go on
209,ep135,in. Thank
210,ep135,you. This is
211,ep135,cute. -I like how open it
212,ep135,is. -Yeah. kind of
213,ep135,nice. So this is a reverse
214,ep135,"ranch. So majority of the homes here on the main level, we do have a finished"
215,ep135,"basement. So not completely you guys' style, but it has the finishes I think you might like,"
216,ep135,"Leah. This house really meets the price that Dan is wanting to stay within, and the size is smaller in"
217,ep135,scale. Leah was wanting more of a finished
218,ep135,product. I'm trying to mesh their two likes
219,ep135,together. It's really
220,ep135,cute. It's just a little
221,ep135,"tight. I mean, our couch might feel"
222,ep135,too... too large for the
223,ep135,"space. I mean, they have the TV"
224,ep135,here. I feel like we can mount it up on the wall so that'll get a little more
225,ep135,"room. Okay, I like the kitchen,"
226,ep135,though. -I like all the
227,ep135,design. -Love the
228,ep135,"design. I mean, it seems like a good"
229,ep135,size. It feels a little
230,ep135,small. I was really hoping for exposed
231,ep135,"wood. It is darker down here, at"
232,ep135,least. I know you are looking for
233,ep135,dark. It's just not exactly my style in that
234,ep135,sense. This house is definitely more geared towards what Dan was looking
235,ep135,"for. It's the price, it's the size, you know, it's that modern contemporary style of a"
236,ep135,home. But I have very specific styles I like to go for and it just doesn't quite hit the mark for
237,ep135,"me. I definitely feel like I have to remind Leah when she really fixates on something on her, like, OCD type moment saying, ""Hey, look at the rest of the"
238,ep135,house. No house is
239,ep135,"perfect."" I like the little nook kind of area just to kind of hang out,"
240,ep135,but... It's really
241,ep135,nice. Um... fences at the
242,ep135,moment. You could certainly have
243,ep135,"that. -I mean, the neighbors have a"
244,ep135,"fence. Yeah,"
245,ep135,"yeah. So I mean, definitely something you can add down the"
246,ep135,road. So the yard is big enough for
247,ep135,us. I think Puddles will definitely like that for
248,ep135,"sure. -Okay, lots of"
249,ep135,construction. Lot of
250,ep135,construction. -[Leah
251,ep135,"chuckles] So with this being a newer neighborhood, this is gonna be something that you'll probably be dealing with for a"
252,ep135,"bit. Yeah. thinking that if we want to have a family in the next year or two and we hear banging outside, it's going to wake up a sleeping baby,"
253,ep135,which... that's not something we're going to
254,ep135,want. On this side of the house here is going to be your main
255,ep135,room. Not a bad closet
256,ep135,"size. Obviously, you'll get the bigger side, I"
257,ep135,assume. I think we might still need more
258,ep135,"space. I like the bathroom,"
259,ep135,though. So this would be you guys'
260,ep135,bedroom. Okay. like
261,ep135,"it. I mean, it's a pretty space,"
262,ep135,"definitely. Yeah,"
263,ep135,yeah. It's just a little tight for my
264,ep135,taste. To your right there is going to be a small bath for both of the two
265,ep135,"bedrooms. It's kind of dark in here,"
266,ep135,"too. I guess, that's why you're a lighting"
267,ep135,"guy. Yeah, it"
268,ep135,is. You can take care of
269,ep135,that. Good size for a kids'
270,ep135,room. They don't need much per
271,ep135,"say. I like the big window on this side,"
272,ep135,too. It just makes me a little nervous to have a window this
273,ep135,big. For kids and then their friends can come in and sneak
274,ep135,in. You're thinking about sneaking
275,ep135,out. I'm thinking
276,ep135,safety. -I trust them more than you
277,ep135,do. -Yeah. they are not even here
278,ep135,yet. Let's head
279,ep135,"downstairs. So finish, I do like"
280,ep135,"that. This is where the parents would stay, but this room just seems a little on the small"
281,ep135,side. But that's what you're getting when you want a smaller
282,ep135,"home. So I feel like this home from what I grew up with, size-wise, it doesn't seem to be"
283,ep135,"enough. It has four bedrooms, but I really was hoping for a fifth bedroom, if not"
284,ep135,more. Just so we have extra guest rooms if my brother comes into town with my
285,ep135,"parents. I do think there is something to be said for how much you get for how much you're paying, and I think this house is a perfect example of"
286,ep135,"that. I definitely get the vibe that this isn't as grandiose as Leah is looking for, but I think when we have kids, it's going to be enough"
287,ep135,"space. So I have to convince her a little more that, ""Hey, you may not be getting this big old house, but for the price point, we can get whatever else you"
288,ep135,"need."" I mean, I know this is kind of what you were hoping to pay, but, yeah, it's a little small for"
289,ep135,me. I think I need something a bit
290,ep135,"larger. So it's back to a larger house for Leah, but Daniel still isn't convinced that bigger is"
291,ep135,"better. Five bedrooms, it's over 4,000 square"
292,ep135,feet. I feel like that means it might be a little more
293,ep135,expensive. [lively music
294,ep135,"playing] After moving twice in under a year for Daniel's job, Leah is hoping they can finally settle down in a big turnkey house she's always"
295,ep135,"wanted. But since he's afraid of what that costs, today, their agents found a place that could split the difference, big for Leah, but on the low end for Dan because it needs some"
296,ep135,"work. Five bedrooms, four and a half"
297,ep135,"bath. It's over 4,000 square"
298,ep135,feet. It's right where I like
299,ep135,it. I feel like that means it might be a little more
300,ep135,expensive. It's actually
301,ep135,"$500,000. It still comes under the amount that we said that we could"
302,ep135,afford. I like the outside
303,ep135,colors. A little gray for
304,ep135,"me. This house isn't exactly craftsman, but the fact that there is five bedrooms is definitely a big win for"
305,ep135,"me. Hey,"
306,ep135,guys. How's it
307,ep135,going? Hey! on
308,ep135,in. Thank
309,ep135,you. I think this house is a happy medium for the two of
310,ep135,"them. It gives Leah the five bedrooms that she's wanting, but also catering to the price that Dan is wanting to spend, because he's able to look past some of the"
311,ep135,imperfections. I'm not loving the
312,ep135,carpet. It's a little shag for my
313,ep135,"taste. I don't mind it,"
314,ep135,though. It's just not what I would have
315,ep135,"chosen. I like the kitchen,"
316,ep135,though. Big
317,ep135,kitchen. You
318,ep135,approve. It's a good-sized
319,ep135,kitchen. I love the wooden cabinets and the color that they
320,ep135,are. I
321,ep135,"just... I don't really love either countertop, but especially this"
322,ep135,one. -I don't love the
323,ep135,granite... -It's kind of
324,ep135,different. ...and not loving the
325,ep135,sink. But I know
326,ep135,that's... it's
327,ep135,fixable. Yeah. just a lot of cosmetic
328,ep135,stuff. I definitely think that Leah has some OCD type moments where she really thinks something needs to be this
329,ep135,"way. You know, she wants just the perfect house that is a ton more money, but we can do some things on our own and in"
330,ep135,time. It doesn't have to be right
331,ep135,"away. I like it's not too big, but it's big"
332,ep135,"enough. Good for our dog, I"
333,ep135,think. -Exactly. love that it's
334,ep135,"fenced. -Yeah, yeah,"
335,ep135,yeah. -That was
336,ep135,"important. I feel like there's definitely a train in the neighborhood,"
337,ep135,"though. Uh, it's not too far"
338,ep135,"away. -I mean, it's not super"
339,ep135,close. Okay. just every once in a while you may hear a little sound like
340,ep135,that. I grew up with
341,ep135,that. You'll fall
342,ep135,asleep. It's good white
343,ep135,noise. Thank
344,ep135,you. This bedroom here has an adjoining
345,ep135,"bathroom. Oh, yeah, I can see all the way"
346,ep135,"through. This is perfect for kids 'cause they each have their own space and they each have their own sinks, which I love, but then they just share"
347,ep135,them. We don't need
348,ep135,it. Each kid doesn't need their own
349,ep135,"bathroom. We didn't live a charmed life like you kind of thing,"
350,ep135,but... I didn't have my own
351,ep135,"bathroom. I know,"
352,ep135,but... I shared with my
353,ep135,"brother. Yeah, so this would be the main"
354,ep135,bedroom. I would like to put our bed on this
355,ep135,wall. So it's
356,ep135,centered... Yeah.
357,ep135,ceiling. I just don't know if our bed would fit over
358,ep135,there. Big bathroom it looks
359,ep135,like. I'm sure you'll like
360,ep135,that. One shower head or
361,ep135,two. We only need
362,ep135,one. Just
363,ep135,one. Don't love these
364,ep135,countertops. These cabinets are pretty beat
365,ep135,up. So I can be pretty particular on what I'm looking
366,ep135,"for. I was really looking for something that was a little more updated and modern, and I'm really thinking it's going to be a large project to get this house to where I would love it to"
367,ep135,be. It's a big closet for
368,ep135,"sure. Oh, my"
369,ep135,"God. -Oh, it's"
370,ep135,huge. It's
371,ep135,just... I had that feeling like it's more than we need kind of
372,ep135,"thing. At some point, probably want to update it though, just 'cause all of these, like, built-in shelves seem"
373,ep135,original. So I must take a
374,ep135,sledgehammer. -Yeah. out one of
375,ep135,these. I'd like to see you with a
376,ep135,"sledgehammer. I still can't get over this carpet 'cause the stairs are different here, which are different from the"
377,ep135,room... Different from
378,ep135,here. Different from these
379,ep135,stairs. It is a little bit of a challenge when someone is very detail-oriented
380,ep135,"on... on small items, because those are very cosmetic fixes that, you know, someone like Dan, he's okay dealing with"
381,ep135,that. So that's a little bit of a
382,ep135,challenge. But I think this could be the
383,ep135,one. This definitely seems like a
384,ep135,totally... Different... house altogether down
385,ep135,here. I do like this
386,ep135,"bar. Oh, I love this"
387,ep135,countertop. Yeah. just don't know if it's going to match the upstairs
388,ep135,"kitchen. Upstairs. do value Leah's opinion a lot in the house, and I do think she has a bit more of a say because we've been moving around a"
389,ep135,lot. But this house is about the most I'm willing to
390,ep135,"spend. It's also, you know, a little big for"
391,ep135,us. Dan grew up in a more modest
392,ep135,"household. And so, I think even though he's a little intimidated having the extra living space, I've moved a lot for him over the last couple"
393,ep135,"years. So I definitely think at this point, it's time that I get a little something that I"
394,ep135,"want. The thing I like about, it has the five bedrooms that you guys have talked about, or Leah has talked about"
395,ep135,"wanting. It's a little bigger for me, but the price point, it seems like a good"
396,ep135,"deal. For 4,000 square feet, it doesn't feel"
397,ep135,"huge. We'll just have to think about it a little more, I"
398,ep135,think. [lively music
399,ep135,"playing] After moving around a lot for Daniel's job, he and Leah are ready to start their family, but she won't do that without a house"
400,ep135,first. There was the home that I really
401,ep135,loved. That was listed at
402,ep135,"$620,000. It was a pretty big"
403,ep135,house. Pretty
404,ep135,grand. It did have some of those craftsman elements that I was looking
405,ep135,for. That price though is just too
406,ep135,much. It was just bigger than it needed to
407,ep135,"be. But then, you know, the other house that we saw, it was listed at"
408,ep135,"$405,000. I liked it a lot for"
409,ep135,sure. It did not have the five bedrooms I was looking
410,ep135,"for. Yeah,"
411,ep135,yeah. And it did feel really
412,ep135,tiny. I
413,ep135,know... I
414,ep135,just... I feel like it was the right house for the right
415,ep135,"price. But that other house,"
416,ep135,"though... The $500,000"
417,ep135,house. I really liked the
418,ep135,basement. It was nice and
419,ep135,"finished. It had the five bedrooms that I love, it had the craftsman"
420,ep135,"style. I did like the backyard a lot, having that fenced in backyard for"
421,ep135,Puddles. But there was just a lot of things I'd want to
422,ep135,do. I really like to just walk into a home that's already
423,ep135,completed. I feel like
424,ep135,I've... I've dragged you around
425,ep135,enough. So what are you
426,ep135,thinking? [upbeat music
427,ep135,playing] You having fun over
428,ep135,there? Meeting? what he
429,ep135,does. That's what he
430,ep135,does. Got to make a little bed for
431,ep135,himself. We ended up choosing the house in
432,ep135,"Lenexa. This house is definitely grand-- -There is hesitation,"
433,ep135,"hesitation. No. no,"
434,ep135,no. You definitely overestimate how grand I
435,ep135,"am. But this house, I think, met all of my hopes and dreams and expectations for a"
436,ep135,"home. It's good I feel like she got what she wanted, while also me getting what I want,"
437,ep135,too. I think one of my favorite things about the house is that Leah is happy with
438,ep135,it. I know moving a lot is a big
439,ep135,thing. So I'm glad that she really likes
440,ep135,"it. It was listed at $500,000, but there were quite a few offers on"
441,ep135,it. So we got the house for
442,ep135,"$502,000. I feel like it"
443,ep135,"was... it is a great buy, a great"
444,ep135,deal. It's like a whole new
445,ep135,cabinet. We closed about a month
446,ep135,"home is ago. We've been here for about a couple of weeks, part of that month was getting the painters in to have them paint while we didn't have anything"
447,ep135,"here. I think I've compromised on some things that we have to update right off the bat, but for the most part, the projects that were there are relatively"
448,ep135,"small. Oh, yeah, making a"
449,ep135,mess. I saw it flop
450,ep135,"out. I love the updated kitchen in our new home, although the counters will need to be updated at some"
451,ep135,"point. I really do think this house feels, you know, a little too big, but it's just good to have our own place that we can call it"
452,ep135,home. You do hear the trains a little
453,ep135,bit. Yeah. they're not that
454,ep135,bad. It's good white
455,ep135,"noise. Okay, come"
456,ep135,on. Ready? go
457,ep135,outside. Puddles loves the
458,ep135,house. A fenced-in yard is really nice to just be able to let him
459,ep135,"out. Yeah, go,"
460,ep135,boy. I like having a place to actually call home and feel like I can actually put something up on the wall and know that I'm not going to have to take it down in the next

41,ep136,[Q and Ray me.
42,ep136,Excuse space.
43,ep136,It's the right time for us to buy a home because we have outgrown this tiny apartment in the city and it's hard for us to work slash live -in this small area.
44,ep136,-Mm-hm. looking in the Alexandria healthcare.
45,ep136,It's a great place for tech.
46,ep136,It's a great place for us.
47,ep136,So it just makes sense for quiet.
48,ep136,And it's very what?
49,ep136,"Right now we have, like, feet?"
50,ep136,800 square good.
51,ep136,"I think if we aim to double that, I think we'd be 2,500."
52,ep136,"Uh, I think like lot."
53,ep136,It would be great because we like to host a buyers.
54,ep136,"I just think a smaller house makes sense for us being first-time home $450,000."
55,ep136,"Our lender approved us for $550,000, but I would love to be close to me."
56,ep136,"Growing up on a small sheep farm in Indiana, where you can get a house for a buffalo nickel, the prices of homes in this area terrify Jersey."
57,ep136,I grew up in South dollars.
58,ep136,"You drive around and you see developments going up for, you know, half a million exist."
59,ep136,So sticker shock for me doesn't townhouse.
60,ep136,"I think it makes sense to do, like, a rowhome or a townhouse."
61,ep136,I grew up in a day.
62,ep136,My parents still live in it to this walls.
63,ep136,But then we'd have shared home.
64,ep136,I'm looking for a detached single-family walls.
65,ep136,I don't like the idea of sharing shifts.
66,ep136,I work exclusively night doing.
67,ep136,I don't like to hear what the neighbors are sleep.
68,ep136,"I don't like to hear the knocking, the tapping, when I'm trying to Jersey."
69,ep136,We definitely need a backyard for too.
70,ep136,I really want an open concept social.

77,ep136,We don't have time for a fixer-upper.
78,ep136,We don't have money for a fixer-upper.
79,ep136,We don't have the experience for a fixer-uppers.
80,ep136,We are in.
81,ep136,So we're looking to move right income.
82,ep136,"Also, a basement with a walk-out because we're thinking about renting that space out for maybe some extra think."
83,ep136,"Having a renter in the house would be a little invasive, I sooner."
84,ep136,But having a renter would definitely help pay our mortgage off something.
85,ep136,"Or, you know, buy a nice bag every other month or laughs]"
86,ep136,[Ray townhome.
87,ep136,Looks like it's a awful.
88,ep136,"It's listed at $450,000, but it looks like there's a small HOA fee too, so that's a little higher, -but not there."

96,ep136,Q and say?
97,ep136,What can I different.
98,ep136,These guys are so opposite.
99,ep136,Ray is more concerned about the price range of homes and Q is just the them.
100,ep136,"They come from different backgrounds, different size homes, different types of homes, and so, they have to kinda compromise to see what works for both of is."
101,ep136,I like how bright it light.
102,ep136,Yeah. is a lot of natural solid.
103,ep136,"Oh, way."

114,ep136,"Okay, so let's have a look at the now."
115,ep136,"Okay, this is way bigger than our kitchen open."
116,ep136,But it's not really efficient.
117,ep136,But it's thing.
118,ep136,We could do like an assembly line kind of it.
119,ep136,I like don't.
120,ep136,I out.
121,ep136,"But Q, he likes to lead with the negative and I like to open things up with the positive, to set a good vibe, so we can start to feel the place myself."
122,ep136,I really just wanna be that.
123,ep136,"If I don't think I like something, I can say now?"
124,ep136,How does the counter space compare to what you have increase.
125,ep136,Tenfold sure.
126,ep136,Yeah. for lot.
127,ep136,I like this counter space a room?
128,ep136,"Okay, so is this the living be."
129,ep136,"Yes, it can you."
130,ep136,And this could actually be like a breakfast nook for room...
131,ep136,"I have to say I love the closed-off kitchen, living room, dining it."

137,ep136,"How does 1,500 square feet sound to you, it."
138,ep136,-I love Q.
139,ep136,"-Yeah, but she said laugh]"
140,ep136,[everyone obviously.
141,ep136,I think definitely I would like it to be bigger again.
142,ep136,"I don't want to have to feel like we're here three, four, five years and then we have to upgrade good."
143,ep136,I think this is expensive.
144,ep136,"I think if we get anything more, it's going to be too price."
145,ep136,Ray is definitely willing to lower his expectations to compromise on the do.
146,ep136,That's not something I'm willing to it.
147,ep136,"If he wants to be Barbie with one leg off, that's totally fine, but I'm not gonna be here for nice."
148,ep136,This is really patio.
149,ep136,Look at this huge chairs.
150,ep136,"We could have table, here."
151,ep136,We could entertain people out yard.
152,ep136,-We have the little space.
153,ep136,Just enough Jersey.
154,ep136,This is perfect for Jersey.
155,ep136,For here...

161,ep136,"Yeah. a matter of fact, this whole house has been huge."
162,ep136,"Wow, this is huh?"
163,ep136,"I don't see a door, so there's no walkout down here, here."
164,ep136,Not Q?
165,ep136,"No. you thinking about renters still, detached."
166,ep136,-Yeah. very attached to the idea of a renter and I'm very TV.
167,ep136,"I mean, I think this would be a fun room to have a bar, walkout."
168,ep136,I don't think we need the walkout.
169,ep136,"I mean, it'd be really nice to have the necessary."
170,ep136,"I know we were talking about the extra income and whatnot, so if that's the route we're going, then I think the walkout would be here."
171,ep136,I can't have a tenant down wanted.
172,ep136,That's something that we definitely it.
173,ep136,At least I wanted house.
174,ep136,I think I should be able to have my way with something in the thick.
175,ep136,I hope these walls are laughs]
176,ep136,[Ray that.
177,ep136,"This could be a guest room, an office, something like but..."
178,ep136,"-Yes. a bit small, space."
179,ep136,This isn't a bad little bathroom.
180,ep136,I'm guessing this is like the guest one.
181,ep136,"Okay. is a nice, bigger space than the other bedroom."
182,ep136,Yeah. this is the primary wow.
183,ep136,"Oh, big."
184,ep136,This is actually really size.
185,ep136,This is a good there.
186,ep136,"I like how we have this all the way over here, and then we can have an office over separated."
187,ep136,"We can have guests over there, but this would be nice and sleeping."
188,ep136,"I would like the main bedroom to be secluded, so that it is quiet for me to sleep during the day when I am closet."
189,ep136,I don't like that this isn't a walk-in space.
190,ep136,"There's not much space, but-- I think it's a good amount of ensuite."
191,ep136,And then this is the ensuite.
192,ep136,This is the tiny.
193,ep136,Yes. little sinks.
194,ep136,I'd rather have dual close.
195,ep136,But that's gonna be a problem with the toilet being so least.
196,ep136,"It's updated, though, at bedroom."
197,ep136,I just like we have our own private bathroom coming off of the spaces.
198,ep136,I really like that it's closed-off walls.
199,ep136,I don't like the shared backyard.
200,ep136,I really like the open.
201,ep136,I didn't like the fact that it doesn't feel walkout.
202,ep136,I didn't like the basement that didn't have a for.
203,ep136,It wouldn't be the extra income that we're looking for.
204,ep136,Maybe more so-- That you're looking either.
205,ep136,You wouldn't mind it laughs]
206,ep136,[everyone compromise.
207,ep136,These two are gonna have to learn to easy.
208,ep136,And finding the right house may not be on.
209,ep136,But now Faith's found something they may be able to agree catch.
210,ep136,"Big enough for Q and single-family for Ray, though with a nervous?"
211,ep136,-The price is like-- -It's-- A little bit Alexandria.
212,ep136,We're heading to another property in feet.
213,ep136,"It's over 3,000 square wow."
214,ep136,"Oh, situation."
215,ep136,That's like the ideal wants.
216,ep136,"Q's high expectations have him ready to pay a premium in Alexandria, Virginia, to get the square footage he more."
217,ep136,But Ray's Midwest outlook says less is wants.
218,ep136,"Today, their broker Faith has found them a home that has both the size and rental potential Q's been asking for and it's the single-family Ray laughs]"
219,ep136,"[Ray $550,000."
220,ep136,It's deal.
221,ep136,"In terms of us getting everything we want, I don't think it's that big of a me."
222,ep136,The idea of having to spend over half a million dollars is honestly just completely jaw-dropping to home.
223,ep136,It's more money than I've heard of pretty much anybody in my life spending on a though.
224,ep136,I am super excited that this is a detached single-family home here.
225,ep136,"Okay, here it is, right cute."

253,ep136,"It definitely feels defined, especially because of the there."
254,ep136,"Mm-hm. you can still be cooking over here, and then, you know, having a conversation over room."
255,ep136,"Q is a very open-concept kind of guy and I think the calamity of cooking and dropping things and running the garbage disposal in the kitchen, would just really interfere with people trying to enjoy their time in the living bedrooms."
256,ep136,"Well, let's go check out the floor."
257,ep136,"So, these are the other two bedrooms on this primary?"
258,ep136,Is this the this.

274,ep136,"Oh, yeah, shower."
275,ep136,"If you're thinking of renting, you've got two bedrooms and you got a bath with a month."
276,ep136,"Probably you could rent it $1,200 a it."
277,ep136,We need a renter to afford have.
278,ep136,"I don't think we need it, it'd be nice to us."
279,ep136,"Hearing Faith say that we can collect $1,200 in rent is great, but I just don't think that that is a smart plan, to count on having a tenant to make the house more affordable for parade."
280,ep136,"This situation right here, in this house, Ray is raining on the here."
281,ep136,"I think that he's so focused on the list price of the house, that he's not really seeing the full picture space."
282,ep136,"I think that it's amazing, especially the area."
283,ep136,Open-concept. downstairs can be someone's complete home.

293,ep136,"area. what Ray won't spare in price isn't lining up with Q's idea of a big, open living city."
294,ep136,"So, today their broker Faith hopes to get them to meet in the middle on a place she's found in the D.C.,"
295,ep136,It's actually in Southeast feet.

365,ep136,We could do a guest bedroom.
366,ep136,We could do the primary here.
367,ep136,It seems like it's great value for our money and I can see us living Ray.
368,ep136,"Watch your head, yeah."
369,ep136,"Oh, small."
370,ep136,This is pretty wow.
371,ep136,"Oh, head."
372,ep136,I feel like the ceiling is right above my careful.
373,ep136,"-Ray, be low."
374,ep136,-Wow. is careful.
375,ep136,"-Ray, be low."
376,ep136,Yeah. is very room.
377,ep136,This might be a good guest outside.
378,ep136,And it could also be a rental because there is access to the $950.
379,ep136,"And in this area, a bedroom is renting for about okay."
380,ep136,"-Oh, nice."
381,ep136,"Yeah, that's really sense."
382,ep136,The idea of having some additional income just makes here.
383,ep136,"And with the low ceiling down here in the basement, I think that Ray would not want to spend time down low."
384,ep136,"So, convincing him to have a tenant would still be a bit of an uphill climb, but not as much of an uphill climb, being as though that the ceiling is so get-go."
385,ep136,I think the price is what sold me from the upstairs.
386,ep136,I like that we have a lot of rooms walls.
387,ep136,I'm not a huge fan of the shared work.
388,ep136,"Uh-huh. not a huge fan of being kind of in the middle of the city, but it is close to basement."
389,ep136,I love the walkout in the floor.
390,ep136,I like the open-concept of this small.
391,ep136,"However, I still feel like every floor is just a little feat."
392,ep136,"With Q and Ray still at odds over price and size, deciding on a house to buy will be no easy kitchen."
393,ep136,I didn't like the enough.
394,ep136,It didn't feel open kitchen.
395,ep136,I honestly don't mind the huge.
396,ep136,I thought the kitchen was making?
397,ep136,What are you sandwich.
398,ep136,A one?
399,ep136,You want price.
400,ep136,"Sure. decide on their first place, Q and Ray need to come together on their opposite expectations for both size and saw?"
401,ep136,What did you think about the renovated townhome that we what?
402,ep136,"It was $450,000?"
403,ep136,"Like, price."
404,ep136,"Yeah, so it was a good Jersey."
405,ep136,And I did really like the idea of the little backyard that's fenced-in for it.
406,ep136,"It didn't have a walkout, so I don't know if we could be able to get a renter in kitchen."
407,ep136,I didn't like the enough.
408,ep136,It didn't feel open kitchen.
409,ep136,I honestly don't mind the huge.
410,ep136,I thought the kitchen was space.
411,ep136,So much counter walls.
412,ep136,I didn't like the idea of having two shared ranch?
413,ep136,What did you think about the open-concept.
414,ep136,It had that really walkout.
415,ep136,And we'd be able to get a renter downstairs with that lot.
416,ep136,But I did like the outdoor space a amazing.
417,ep136,I thought the backyard was walls.
418,ep136,It was the only thing we saw with no shared home.
419,ep136,It was the only single-family just...
420,ep136,"I mean, I liked a lot about the house, I price."
421,ep136,the off.
422,ep136,It was a sticker shock that didn't wear duplex?
423,ep136,What did you think about the phenomenal.
424,ep136,The price is rooms.
425,ep136,"I thought the duplex was cute, but I did not like the size of the basement."
426,ep136,I did like that it had a walkout in the work.
427,ep136,It was close to know.
428,ep136,I don't stuff.
429,ep136,"I think that the busyness of the city will really become an issue for you, like when you're trying to sleep and point."
430,ep136,That's a good outside?
431,ep136,Jersey! go Jers.
432,ep136,"Come on, townhome."
433,ep136,We ended up going with the renovated value.
434,ep136,"We felt like for the price and the new renovations, it was the best $450,000."
435,ep136,"It was listed for $450,000 and we paid it."""
436,ep136,"Once we decided to go with the townhome, we very quickly put in an offer and Q said, ""Tell them if they don't accept the offer by midnight, we're pulling that."
437,ep136,-And Faith sent them it.
438,ep136,-Yeah. then they accepted later.
439,ep136,She called us an hour amazing.
440,ep136,It was Healthcare.
441,ep136,Business. laugh]
442,ep136,[Ray and Q Warm.
443,ep136,Cold. laugh]
444,ep136,[Ray and Q here.
445,ep136,"Jersey, come it."
446,ep136,Go get boy!
447,ep136,Good backyard.
448,ep136,My favorite thing about the house so far is definitely the space.
449,ep136,I think it's such a nice outdoor Jersey.
450,ep136,It's perfect for basement.
451,ep136,My favorite thing about the house is definitely the theater-like.
452,ep136,"I'm bummed about not having a renter downstairs, but we put the couch down there with the TV and it just feels very homey and very lie."
453,ep136,I can't basement.
454,ep136,I'm pretty excited that we're not gonna have a renter in the parade.
455,ep136,We don't have to worry about a third-party raining on our cabinets.
456,ep136,We definitely don't have enough stuff to fill all these don't.
457,ep136,"No, we house."
458,ep136,I think we actually met right in the middle in terms of who got their way with the townhome.
459,ep136,I got my bad.
460,ep136,The kitchen isn't too open.
461,ep136,I wish it was a little more us.
462,ep136,"I just think having so much counter space, so much more cabinet space, ended up doing it for both of awesome."
463,ep136,"Because the separation we have from the main bedroom to the office, and the rest of the house, is rest."
464,ep136,It gives me kind of my own world to sleep in during the day when I need to get my be.
465,ep136,Sharing walls is definitely not as bad as I thought it would between.
466,ep136,"Something I didn't know about, like the townhouse, rowhome situation, is that they have firewalls in imagined."
467,ep136,"And it's actually really thick and insulating, so it's a lot quieter than I kind of it."
468,ep136,Thumb. laugh]
469,ep136,[Ray and Q more.
470,ep136,"Through this whole process, I think we figured out how to work together a lot lives."
471,ep136,"And we're kind of, like, on to a new chapter in our day."
472,ep136,I definitely think we learned a lot of teamwork and what makes good partners at the end of the
1,ep137,"Hey, Kevin."
2,ep137,"Hey, Loni."
3,ep137,"Hi, Ginny."
4,ep137,Kevin and Loni's agent has been showing them beautiful properties in San Diego for almost a year.
5,ep137,And while Loni's liked what she's seen...
6,ep137,This is exactly what I want.
7,ep137,...Kevin imperfections everywhere.
8,ep137,"This fireplace, it's not even centered."
9,ep137,I don't see -a walk-in pantry.
10,ep137,-I know.
11,ep137,I know.
12,ep137,We cannot lose a house because it doesn't have a walk-in pantry.
13,ep137,Kevin is a perfectionist.
14,ep137,"And unfortunately, with the money that they want to spend, he's not gonna get perfection."
15,ep137,His wife's trying to get him to see reason on price...
16,ep137,"I would rather spend a little bit more, and be a little closer to the beach."
17,ep137,...but hoping she can hang on just a little longer.
18,ep137,"Loni's been really patient with me, but I just keep waiting for that perfect house, and I think it could be right around the corner."
19,ep137,[theme music playing]
20,ep137,-[girl babbling]
21,ep137,-[Loni speaks indistinctly]
22,ep137,Take your medicine.
23,ep137,"-Oh, thank you."
24,ep137,Medicine? that's delicious.
25,ep137,Thank... met ten years ago in San Francisco.
26,ep137,There was a friend of a friend situation.
27,ep137,"I walk in the door from a run, and there's a cute boy sitting on my couch just watching football."
28,ep137,"So I used all my football knowledge to really impress him, and I got him."
29,ep137,I want you to play.
30,ep137,I want you to play.
31,ep137,I'm gonna play.
32,ep137,I'm gonna play.
33,ep137,Our house in the Bay Area was starting to feel very small.
34,ep137,My mom and dad moved down to San Diego a few years ago.
35,ep137,So that was when San Diego started to be very appealing to us.
36,ep137,"And then, we became able to work remotely."
37,ep137,Who wants to make cupcakes?
38,ep137,"Mattie, you wanna go?"
39,ep137,Mattie's gone.
40,ep137,Let's go.
41,ep137,We moved down here with the idea that we'd be in his parents'' house for a month or two and find our home pretty quickly.
42,ep137,And we're here a year later.
43,ep137,"Every house we walk into, she's already talked herself into it."
44,ep137,"I'm much more of a realist, where I tend to spot what Loni was describe as minor imperfections."
45,ep137,"You're missing all the feeling and heart, that's all."
46,ep137,You gotta make an offer quickly.
47,ep137,"We want to think it through, too."
48,ep137,"I want something more colonial, ideally."
49,ep137,I'm really just looking for one of those ranch style houses.
50,ep137,"I'll take anything, but Spanish style."
51,ep137,"I just, um..."
52,ep137,I don't think I can do it.
53,ep137,Which is all there is.
54,ep137,It would be nice to have you close by.
55,ep137,"-Yeah, we definitely want..."
56,ep137,We can all hang out.
57,ep137,Something nearby would be great.
58,ep137,"And, also, easy access to the beach."
59,ep137,"That costs a lot of money, so I don't know how realistic that is for you."
60,ep137,"After all this time, we still haven't come to a consensus on exactly how much we want to spend on the house."
61,ep137,"Kevin's definitely way down in the 1.2,"
62,ep137,"and I'm way up at 1.4,"
63,ep137,and that's a big difference.
64,ep137,"I work in corporate finance, I live in a numbers world."
65,ep137,We just put an offer in on the place.
66,ep137,"Right by the beach, it's really nice, -but..."
67,ep137,-[girl speaks indistinctly]
68,ep137,...we outbid by cash.
69,ep137,"-so, yeah."
70,ep137,"-Oh, no."
71,ep137,"And if it's by the beach, it's probably too small for you guys, right?"
72,ep137,"-Oh, yeah."
73,ep137,-It was smaller.
74,ep137,"I feel like Kevin wants, like, McMansion, gigantic house, and I don't feel like we need that at all."
75,ep137,Two thousand square feet would be more than enough for us.
76,ep137,-It won't be hard to clean.
77,ep137,"-No, you're crazy."
78,ep137,"We need, I think we need at least 3,000 square feet, if not even more than that."
79,ep137,"We have two girls, we need home office space for our remote work."
80,ep137,"On top of that, I would really like a room for myself, where I can get away and escape from the kids and the madness."
81,ep137,You can hide out in the bedroom or the bathroom.
82,ep137,That's not a hideout.
83,ep137,[all laugh]
84,ep137,You guys have such a nice kitchen here.
85,ep137,"Well, it is fine."
86,ep137,I really like your walk-in pantry.
87,ep137,So it'd be nice to have that.
88,ep137,"At my grandma's house, she had a walk-in pantry and I always thought it was so cool."
89,ep137,"A pantry is so not necessary, but..."
90,ep137,"I mean, we need a pantry, but a walk-in?"
91,ep137,I mean...
92,ep137,I don't think there's a lot of those.
93,ep137,"Well, that's what the search is all about."
94,ep137,"It's finding that diamond in the rough at my price point, which I consider to be quite realistic."
95,ep137,Aye... is what we haven't found a house yet.
96,ep137,"It's closer to the size that I like, 2500 square feet."
97,ep137,It's a little small as far as I'm concerned.
98,ep137,You'll be happy about the price.
99,ep137,It's 1.229.
100,ep137,"Okay, a little above my range, but I do like that it's so close to the beach."
101,ep137,"Hey, guys."
102,ep137,"-Hi, Ginny."
103,ep137,"-Hey, Ginny."
104,ep137,Welcome to the beach.
105,ep137,And it's not Spanish.
106,ep137,"Yeah, it's almost kinda got like a coastal feel."
107,ep137,I love it.
108,ep137,I've been working with Kevin and Loni for quite some time now.
109,ep137,It seems like they're on such different pages.
110,ep137,And Kevin needs to figure out what's important to him.
111,ep137,"He wants to be by the beach, he's gonna have to give up the square footage and the dream of, you know, five bedrooms and his hideaway."
112,ep137,"This is beautiful in here, Wow."
113,ep137,-This is really nice.
114,ep137,Yeah. love the exposed beams here.
115,ep137,That's really cool.
116,ep137,"And the kitchen, I love the backsplash, I love the appliances."
117,ep137,This is exactly what I want.
118,ep137,-Wow. it's really nice in here.
119,ep137,"It's open, it's white."
120,ep137,Is there a pantry or...
121,ep137,I knew you were gonna ask.
122,ep137,There is not a pantry.
123,ep137,It looks like the only storage would be over here for your pantry.
124,ep137,That does it.
125,ep137,Let's go home.
126,ep137,-[Ginny laughs]
127,ep137,Uh-oh. can't say no to this beautiful room.
128,ep137,-Come on.
129,ep137,"Come on, Kev."
130,ep137,Let's keep going with this beautiful pool.
131,ep137,Wow. your dream come true.
132,ep137,"What a big, nice pool."
133,ep137,I love it.
134,ep137,I love the shape.
135,ep137,"Well, I still have concerns about the pool with two little girls."
136,ep137,"Well, we could put a fence up, Kev."
137,ep137,That's no big deal.
138,ep137,Another thing I'm not seeing is any grass for our kids to run around and play on.
139,ep137,"But keep in mind, Loni really wants her pool, Kevin."
140,ep137,-[both laugh]
141,ep137,We are gonna go up here to look at the bedrooms.
142,ep137,So here are the girls' rooms.
143,ep137,"Yeah, nice size room, really sunny and bright."
144,ep137,Decent sized closet.
145,ep137,They could live with that.
146,ep137,"Ideally, one day, she'll still be here in her teenage years, and I imagine she'll need some more closet space."
147,ep137,There could be some complaints later.
148,ep137,-But I'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
149,ep137,-Yeah. house is more than enough space for our family.
150,ep137,"But of course, with everything, he's critical of the flaws."
151,ep137,"Oh, wow, this is really nice."
152,ep137,I love the black and the white that they did.
153,ep137,It's only a single vanity for two girls.
154,ep137,-So they'd have to share.
155,ep137,They could make it work.
156,ep137,-Uh... you know our girls?
157,ep137,-[both laugh]
158,ep137,-Have you met them?
159,ep137,"There might be some, uh, wrestling."
160,ep137,-They aren't the greatest at sharing.
161,ep137,-No. size room.
162,ep137,"So far I'm noticing there's not very much space for storage or closet space, which has me concerned just about clutter and keep the house looking clean and neat."
163,ep137,"With so many positive things in this house, I don't want you guys to be scared just because of the lack of closet space."
164,ep137,Why don't we go out and look at the beautiful balcony?
165,ep137,Ooh. nice actually.
166,ep137,"I mean, I like the outdoor space."
167,ep137,It is kinda noisy though with all the traffic going back and forth in front of the house.
168,ep137,Yeah. not gonna come out here in my underwear in the morning.
169,ep137,-That's for certain.
170,ep137,-[both laugh]
171,ep137,Let's go inside and take a look at the main bath...
172,ep137,All right.
173,ep137,...where find the bathtub that you wanted.
174,ep137,"I like that, yeah."
175,ep137,"Oh, wow."
176,ep137,I love the claw feet.
177,ep137,Look at that.
178,ep137,That's amazing.
179,ep137,I do.
180,ep137,I like the bathtub a lot.
181,ep137,I like that look.
182,ep137,I have a question though.
183,ep137,This is open again?
184,ep137,In our last house we had this problem.
185,ep137,where we didn't have a door.
186,ep137,"I guess, could we frame a door in here or something easily?"
187,ep137,-'Cause... can be done.
188,ep137,-What about a barn door?
189,ep137,"I think they chose to keep it open to, you know, make it feel bigger."
190,ep137,So would you describe it as a split level or two storeys?
191,ep137,This would be a split level.
192,ep137,The guest bath is right here.
193,ep137,"It's interesting that they moved the double vanity in the guest bathroom, but I'd prefer that to be in the girls' bathroom upstairs."
194,ep137,That's a good point.
195,ep137,One extra sink.
196,ep137,"Hey, I won't complain about that, -I guess."
197,ep137,-Yeah. on over to this guestroom.
198,ep137,I think this could be a great potential office for one of you.
199,ep137,"Or with the size, both of you."
200,ep137,"Or a better idea, just my own personal hideaway."
201,ep137,"Uh, no, no, no, no."
202,ep137,"With a house this size, you don't get a hideaway, babe."
203,ep137,'Cause I'm gonna need my office.
204,ep137,And you can't hide out in my office.
205,ep137,This is exactly the way I envisioned my kitchen and our living area to be.
206,ep137,I love that pool in the backyard.
207,ep137,"But there's no grass out there, so that's a definite downside for me."
208,ep137,"And then, it's only 2,500 square feet."
209,ep137,I think we need a little more space.
210,ep137,"Loni is a very positive person, and she always sees the positive in everything."
211,ep137,And it's a lot to consider in terms of rushing into making an offer.
212,ep137,I know Loni is starting to get a little frustrated and impatient with me waiting to find that perfect house.
213,ep137,But it just simply doesn't suit our specific needs.
214,ep137,So they're off to see another house.
215,ep137,"This one's bigger, but more inland."
216,ep137,"I would rather spend a little bit more, and be a little closer to the beach, frankly."
217,ep137,Loni's the more flexible of these two when it comes to buying a family home in San Diego.
218,ep137,So she's agreed to see a bigger home farther out for Kevin.
219,ep137,Even though she thinks it's excessive.
220,ep137,-Four thousand square feet?
221,ep137,-I like that.
222,ep137,That's huge.
223,ep137,I do not like that.
224,ep137,Are we getting a maid?
225,ep137,"Well, the good news is it's plenty big, there's plenty of rooms for all of us."
226,ep137,"Plus, maybe I can even get my hideaway."
227,ep137,"Oh, gosh."
228,ep137,"It's 1.2,"
229,ep137,so that should make you happy.
230,ep137,"I would rather spend a little bit more, and be a little closer to the beach, frankly."
231,ep137,"Hey, guys."
232,ep137,"Hey, Ginny."
233,ep137,"Hey, Ginny."
234,ep137,-This is really nice.
235,ep137,I like it.
236,ep137,"-It's not Spanish, which is already a bonus for me."
237,ep137,Yes. we're working with the craftsman style out here.
238,ep137,"Working with Loni and Kevin has been a challenge because if it's not exactly what Kevin, you know, has envisioned, it can throw the whole house off."
239,ep137,"Oh, wow."
240,ep137,This... house is massive.
241,ep137,I'm not sure what we're doing with this post here.
242,ep137,It would be nice to kind of remove that and have it just be an open space.
243,ep137,Let's look beyond the little things right now and just see how you feel about the whole house.
244,ep137,Here is your living room.
245,ep137,It looks a little dated.
246,ep137,"Yeah. it up to the current year, -it'll look a lot better I bet."
247,ep137,-[Loni and Ginny]
248,ep137,Yeah. kitchen is wow.
249,ep137,"I mean, big, white."
250,ep137,This is what I was hoping for.
251,ep137,"It's bright, there's plenty of windows and natural light."
252,ep137,And it opens into the family room living space.
253,ep137,You might wanna look behind that door.
254,ep137,"-Oh, my gosh."
255,ep137,The pantry.
256,ep137,The walk-in...
257,ep137,It's got a walk-in pantry.
258,ep137,"I can buy groceries in bulk, and plenty of room to keep them."
259,ep137,"Gosh. if you walk through here, there's a bedroom downstairs."
260,ep137,"You know, I'm thinking this would be perfect for my little hideaway."
261,ep137,I have my own bathroom.
262,ep137,This could be my own little kind of personal space for myself.
263,ep137,"Uh, not so fast."
264,ep137,I think this actually would be a perfect office for me.
265,ep137,You guys don't have to argue over what this room's gonna be because there is plenty of space upstairs for all your wants.
266,ep137,I find it interesting that almost male client I've worked with lately has wanted a hideaway.
267,ep137,"I don't know what they're hiding away from, but they all want one."
268,ep137,The staircase is carpet that definitely needs to be replaced.
269,ep137,"Oh, the projects."
270,ep137,"Don't love the built-in there, but that could be easy..."
271,ep137,Could you make this an office space?
272,ep137,No. this is a great size bedroom.
273,ep137,This should be another great option for my office then.
274,ep137,-It's a nice room.
275,ep137,-Yeah. this is a full bath.
276,ep137,My only criticism would be the carpet on the floor of the bathroom.
277,ep137,It always kind of throws me off.
278,ep137,"You can take the carpet out of the bathroom, Kevin."
279,ep137,And here is another bedroom.
280,ep137,I can't believe there's so many rooms up here.
281,ep137,This house is massive.
282,ep137,"Who's gonna clean all this, Kevin?"
283,ep137,"Uh, all of us?"
284,ep137,"I don't think Kevin understands, at all, what it takes to keep a house this size clean and neat with two young children."
285,ep137,That is going to be a full-time job for someone.
286,ep137,I don't have time to do all that.
287,ep137,And here's the main bedroom.
288,ep137,"Oh, cool."
289,ep137,Whoa! is enormous.
290,ep137,Take a look behind you.
291,ep137,You have your own patio.
292,ep137,"Oh, wow."
293,ep137,This is so cool.
294,ep137,"I can' definitely see myself coming out here in the morning with a cup of coffee, and starting my day."
295,ep137,"These dual closets, you're not gonna have to worry about closet space."
296,ep137,"Oh, wow."
297,ep137,They're massive.
298,ep137,T hat is perfect.
299,ep137,Exactly what we need.
300,ep137,I like the view.
301,ep137,"Better view, the beach."
302,ep137,But it does have an entertaining area and you got your grass.
303,ep137,There's at least some grass for the kids to run around in.
304,ep137,At least while they're young.
305,ep137,"Yeah, but I think they would outgrow this yard pretty quickly."
306,ep137,"I'm still missing a pool in this yard, which is a little disappointing."
307,ep137,"I love the size of the house, I love the square footage."
308,ep137,"But it's so far from the beach and so far from my mom and dad and my sister, Loni's been really patient with me throughout this whole process as I've dragged my feet a little bit."
309,ep137,"But I just keep waiting for that perfect house, and I think it could be right around the corner."
310,ep137,"There's another house right around the corner, and it could be perfect if Kevin could just loosen up on a few things."
311,ep137,You know Spanish style isn't my favorite.
312,ep137,I know.
313,ep137,"I know, but if we took Spanish off the list, we probably would be out of 50% of the houses in Southern California."
314,ep137,It's close to my sister and my mom and dad.
315,ep137,Fairly close to the beach.
316,ep137,I prefer to be a little closer.
317,ep137,"I know you don't love that, but let's just give it a chance."
318,ep137,"Kevin's so determined to get the perfect house, that his and Loni's house hunt has been going on for around a year."
319,ep137,"He, in particular, is hoping this next place will finally be it."
320,ep137,"Hey, Kevin."
321,ep137,"Hey, Loni."
322,ep137,"Hi, Ginny."
323,ep137,-[speaks indistinctly]
324,ep137,Good to see you.
325,ep137,I know.
326,ep137,You know Spanish style isn't my favorite.
327,ep137,I know.
328,ep137,"I know, but the only thing is you know, if we took Spanish off the list, we probably would be out of 50% of the houses in Southern California."
329,ep137,-Okay? enough.
330,ep137,"Okay. is a great property because it is not massive, but it feels big."
331,ep137,And it's still very close to the beach.
332,ep137,"Oh, I love how open it is."
333,ep137,Yeah. vaulted ceilings are really nice.
334,ep137,I'm not as big of a fan of the floors.
335,ep137,"I mean, they're okay."
336,ep137,They're kinds light.
337,ep137,"Oh, it's enormous in here."
338,ep137,And what is this fireplace?
339,ep137,It's not even centered.
340,ep137,"I knew it not being symmetrical was gonna throw you off, Kevin, but I think that, um..."
341,ep137,"I mean, you could, you know, retile, repaint and make it a little bit more appealing."
342,ep137,Kevin is a perfectionist.
343,ep137,And he likes things to be perfect.
344,ep137,"And unfortunately, with the money that they want to spend on the house, he's not gonna get perfection, and he's not gonna get everything symmetrical, and he's not gonna get the perfect house with his price point."
345,ep137,-The kitchen.
346,ep137,Oh. beautiful and open.
347,ep137,I don't like the dark wood cabinets.
348,ep137,And this white tile counter top looks a little dated to me.
349,ep137,I feel like this could work.
350,ep137,"I mean, this is a pretty big kitchen."
351,ep137,"I was looking over here, I don't see a pantry -or a walk-in pantry."
352,ep137,I know.
353,ep137,I know.
354,ep137,Definitely needs to go on the project list.
355,ep137,We cannot lose a house because it doesn't have a walk-in pantry.
356,ep137,"Wow, look at this pool though."
357,ep137,It's huge!
358,ep137,I love it.
359,ep137,Would be able to put a fence around this or...
360,ep137,"Yes, there's lots of options -for, you know, fences."
361,ep137,"Okay. look, Kev, there's your grass."
362,ep137,You got your grass.
363,ep137,"-I mean, it's some grass."
364,ep137,-We can get grass in.
365,ep137,But I was kind of imagining a larger lawn.
366,ep137,I see plenty of fun in this grass here for our kids.
367,ep137,What's this over here?
368,ep137,Is this like a tool shed -or storage?
369,ep137,-It's actually...
370,ep137,It was a playroom.
371,ep137,But I was thinking this would be an awesome office.
372,ep137,"Oh, wow."
373,ep137,"Oh, my."
374,ep137,Look at this.
375,ep137,"""The Barn Babes."""
376,ep137,[all chuckle]
377,ep137,-But it's got electricity in here.
378,ep137,Yeah. I feel like it's be really easy to convert this into an office.
379,ep137,"Mattie might want it, but..."
380,ep137,She can live without it.
381,ep137,"I am not a big fan of carpet, especially older carpet."
382,ep137,-It just holds on to all sorts of stuff.
383,ep137,"So we're gonna have to refloor the whole house, huh?"
384,ep137,"-Oh, wow."
385,ep137,Look at this fun area.
386,ep137,"Yeah, this is super neat."
387,ep137,What a cool room.
388,ep137,And it could always double as a guest room since this room is such a big size.
389,ep137,I was thinking about maybe something for me.
390,ep137,"A little getaway room, -an escape from the chaos of the day."
391,ep137,"-Oh, your hideout room?"
392,ep137,-Yeah. I still think a bedroom would service that just fine.
393,ep137,"But maybe, we'll see."
394,ep137,"These two rooms are connected by the bathroom, -so the girls would share a bathroom."
395,ep137,Oh. small sinks for two small girls.
396,ep137,I love it.
397,ep137,"This is a nice sized room in here, nice and bright."
398,ep137,"And then, either Mattie or Charlie can be in this room."
399,ep137,"Can't stand carpeting, especially old carpeting."
400,ep137,It just grosses me out.
401,ep137,So we'd have to tear that out.
402,ep137,This is the main room.
403,ep137,"Again, the carpet."
404,ep137,Definitely needs to go.
405,ep137,"Our last place was so small, we could barely fit our bed, but now, we could have furniture and everything."
406,ep137,So I like the size of this room.
407,ep137,Let's look at the main bath.
408,ep137,"It's got good potential, but this bathroom needs to be updated."
409,ep137,"That's another project that we would have to do on top of the flooring, the kitchen, the outdoor space."
410,ep137,"When Kevin talks about a full-scale renovation, it makes me very nervous."
411,ep137,"Not the cost of it, but really, the time it's gonna take before we can move into our house."
412,ep137,"I know the idea if all the remodeling makes Loni nervous, and I realize I'm asking or a lower price but I do think in the long run, it's worthwhile to put in the time and money to make it feel more like our home and our space."
413,ep137,"As you guys know how crazy the market is with all that we've, you know, been through these last couple months, if this is the one you want, we're gonna have to get the offer in."
414,ep137,"Kevin and Loni realize that if they're ever going to get into a house in San Diego, he's going to have to stop demanding perfection and consider properties that are attainable."
415,ep137,What were your thoughts on the modern coastal in Oceanside?
416,ep137,That was my favorite kitchen by far.
417,ep137,And I feel like absolutely no projects are necessary.
418,ep137,"The backyard, I actually really loved the pool."
419,ep137,And I also loved how close that was to the beach.
420,ep137,"But there's not enough square footage, there was no grassy area for our kids to run around on and there was no walk-in pantry."
421,ep137,How about the craftsman in San Marcos?
422,ep137,I absolutely love that kitchen.
423,ep137,"It was a little far, but it did have that walk-in pantry."
424,ep137,"It had the best grassy backyard, and I thought it was good size for us."
425,ep137,That's a lot of house to maintain.
426,ep137,What did you think of the Spanish house in Carlsbad?
427,ep137,"You know, with the pool and then we've got your grass over on the side."
428,ep137,And I really loved that bonus office.
429,ep137,But I didn't love the Spanish style.
430,ep137,"Also, no walk-in pantry."
431,ep137,It kind of see it a blank slate for us to make it our own.
432,ep137,It feels like it'll be a long time before we can move in to that place.
433,ep137,"I have my preferences, but if you will pick a house, Kevin, I'll make it work."
434,ep137,"Maybe we can run a fence just along here, and then, we could just cut off access to the pool this way."
435,ep137,I like that.
436,ep137,We ended up with the Spanish house.
437,ep137,You chose a house!
438,ep137,So we got the result we needed.
439,ep137,"And one of the best things that I loved about this house was that outdoor area and the pool house, which we're gonna convert into my office, so I think it worked out."
440,ep137,"We are close to the beach, close to my family."
441,ep137,This is a home that we can now grow in to.
442,ep137,The house was listed for 1.249.
443,ep137,We decided to come in very aggressively at 1.32.
444,ep137,"They accepted it almost right away, We ended up spending more than I wanted to spend, but it's all going to be worth it in the end."
445,ep137,"But if could move the spa maybe into the pool, we'd have all this space for entertainment."
446,ep137,A big compromise I made for this house is all the renovations.
447,ep137,And that means that we're not going to be in this house for a couple months.
448,ep137,But I get really excited about how this house will be when we're all done with all the projects.
449,ep137,One of the biggest compromises for me with this house was that I did not get my walk-in pantry.
450,ep137,But we're building a new kitchen from the ground up.
451,ep137,We've also removed the asymmetrical fireplace.
452,ep137,"Having, finally, our permanent home here, in San Diego, I mean, it means the world to me."
453,ep137,I know that we are gonna build a great really life together.
454,ep137,So glad you got there.
455,ep137,[both laugh]
456,ep137,I got there eventually.
1,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
2,ep138,Wow. is the feel that I really like.
3,ep138,"Ryan's only 25 but his job as a software engineer means he can afford $800,000 condos in DC's trendiest neighborhoods."
4,ep138,One of my favorite parts of this condo is that you have water views.
5,ep138,But his worried parents want him to spend his money on a larger place farther out.
6,ep138,"Did they put you up to this, they were telling me to look outside the city."
7,ep138,And as successful as he is this is still all new to him.
8,ep138,And he's afraid of making a mistake.
9,ep138,"I'm starting to wish we could just like pick up this place, move it to DC."
10,ep138,If we pick this up and put it in DC it'd be over a million.
11,ep138,The bottom line is that this holds its value.
12,ep138,"It's the location I want, -it's in the city."
13,ep138,Yeah. it's a huge decision with a lot of money on the line.
14,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
15,ep138,Did you get those houses I emailed you?
16,ep138,"Yes, I was just looking at them."
17,ep138,I'm a software engineer.
18,ep138,I write code all day and I find it a lot of fun.
19,ep138,"I would definitely classify myself as a nerd, but as you get older nerds honestly are in like they're more cool, in my opinion, even if we weren't in high school."
20,ep138,I'm getting antsy.
21,ep138,"I won't be back in the city, too."
22,ep138,-It's just...
23,ep138,-Yeah. a different vibe in the suburbs.
24,ep138,"Are you gonna miss me, Eric?"
25,ep138,No. even a little bit.
26,ep138,"-Well, I'm gonna miss you."
27,ep138,My job is located in Washington DC in the Georgetown area.
28,ep138,I'm kind of just living with my parents right now to save money.
29,ep138,I feel this sense of urgency and antsiness just increasing with every passing day.
30,ep138,"I want to be dating again, and I want to have my own space."
31,ep138,And now I'm ready to settle down in DC more permanently.
32,ep138,"That's expensive, dude."
33,ep138,"I'm paying for a location, DC is a fun place."
34,ep138,"Sorry, no offense, but it looks like a little shack."
35,ep138,"It's DC, Mom."
36,ep138,You don't get much space for your money.
37,ep138,"Last thing you wanna do is settle, you need to like make sure that this house is what you wanna live in."
38,ep138,It's a big deal.
39,ep138,"My parents have been very involved in giving me their thoughts, which I really appreciate, but I'm gonna start looking at places on my own."
40,ep138,At the end of the day this is a hundred percent my own purchase.
41,ep138,"Ideally, I would spend somewhere in the $700,000 range, I would be hesitant to go over $800,000 but honestly with every passing month at my parents' house saving money on rent that could possibly increase for the perfect house if it comes along."
42,ep138,I'm definitely gonna miss the food when I move out.
43,ep138,"So I know a lot of people are probably wondering how a 25-year-old can afford an $800,000 house."
44,ep138,"I think this is where, you know, nerds are cool software engineering does pay well and I acknowledge that."
45,ep138,"What, someone didn't set a fork?"
46,ep138,-We thought you're moving out.
47,ep138,-We thought you moved out.
48,ep138,I'm looking for a condo or a row home I like the character of exposed brick or a wood burning fireplace.
49,ep138,What are you looking for that you're not getting?
50,ep138,"I want two bed, two bath, that's just hard to get and why I can't afford or a lot of places are like old and rundown."
51,ep138,Outdoor space that's also hard to come by in the city.
52,ep138,"I really like to have friends over and grill, modern look, open concept."
53,ep138,"Overall, I'm kind of a picky person."
54,ep138,I would describe myself as type A.
55,ep138,I am looking for the perfect house and my perfectionist qualities are coming out here.
56,ep138,Sounds like you want this place.
57,ep138,Yeah. in the city.
58,ep138,Why don't you...
59,ep138,"Yes. this giant house in suburban Maryland and move it to DC, and fit it somewhere."
60,ep138,"Why don't you live close to a metro station, then you can metro into the city for work?"
61,ep138,You're saying a metro station -outside of the city?
62,ep138,-Mmm-hmm. thank you.
63,ep138,I do not wanna be outside the city.
64,ep138,"I am gonna start visiting places on my own going forward just to, you know, have a fresh perspective."
65,ep138,I don't wanna say you guys rain on my parade every time.
66,ep138,-But. doesn't want -our opinion.
67,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
68,ep138,This community is so cute.
69,ep138,-Yeah. love all the brick.
70,ep138,Ryan has a lot that he's looking for.
71,ep138,He wants outdoor space.
72,ep138,He wants more than one bath.
73,ep138,"I know in much of the country $800,000 can buy you a mansion."
74,ep138,"But here in DC, in the city, 800 K actually won't get you that much."
75,ep138,Ryan's really struggling with wanting perfection so that means he wants the interior and the location.
76,ep138,My strategy is to show him options so that he's able to choose either the perfect home or the perfect location.
77,ep138,It would be nice to hear your opinion on it without your parents here.
78,ep138,I think they would also like the price point.
79,ep138,"I mean, it is $709,000, which is really nice."
80,ep138,"Mmm-hmm. two bed, one bath."
81,ep138,I'm a little concerned about the inside -with it only having one bath.
82,ep138,Right. the location is amazing.
83,ep138,And to think I could afford something here is really exciting.
84,ep138,"I think you're gonna love it, it has a lot of what you're looking for."
85,ep138,"Today, I'm really trying to get Ryan to focus on what he feels, not what his parents think, but really what he wants."
86,ep138,So we'll see.
87,ep138,Whoa. is the feel that I really like.
88,ep138,I know this is on the smaller side.
89,ep138,"Right. it's new with some new floors, exposed brick that's really cozy, and it has the wood burning fireplace."
90,ep138,It does.
91,ep138,One of my favorite parts of this condo is that you have water views.
92,ep138,I love how close it is to the waterfront.
93,ep138,I would go running there all the time.
94,ep138,"You know, the biggest factor for an outdoor space -is grilling for me."
95,ep138,And I...
96,ep138,Right. can fit one here.
97,ep138,So this is the only part that isn't open concept really.
98,ep138,"Yeah, the kitchen is pretty small and just completely shut off from the rest of the living area -and the dining area."
99,ep138,-Right. can't be cooking here and talking to my guests.
100,ep138,It's a rather tight space in here.
101,ep138,It's functional for the space.
102,ep138,So there's two beds on this level.
103,ep138,This is your second bedroom.
104,ep138,It's a little tight to fit a bed here.
105,ep138,I'm just a bachelor buying a house.
106,ep138,So this will be for my friends to crash when they visit.
107,ep138,Or maybe I'll have an office here for working.
108,ep138,So this is the one full bath.
109,ep138,This is functional.
110,ep138,"That seems to be what we're going with, -with the price point."
111,ep138,"-It's definitely okay now as, you know, just a single guy but and guests will always have to go up the stairs, -so..."
112,ep138,-Yes. will have to.
113,ep138,...I'm have to think about this.
114,ep138,So here's your main bedroom.
115,ep138,This one's very spacious actually.
116,ep138,It is very spacious.
117,ep138,"Unfortunately, there are no closets."
118,ep138,That's why it's so spacious.
119,ep138,"That's one of those things where if my mom was with me she'd immediately point out and probably have a fit about, is that something you can add?"
120,ep138,"I mean, eventually you could close this off, but I do also kind of like the space."
121,ep138,It gives you more to play around with.
122,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
123,ep138,I love this area.
124,ep138,Yeah. love the community.
125,ep138,"And when I first came in, I was excited by this space."
126,ep138,"You have a nice view, you have natural light, -the exposed brick."
127,ep138,Mmm-hmm. a very limited outdoor space here.
128,ep138,The kitchen is small and doesn't open up.
129,ep138,Right. the big items are no closets and only one bathroom.
130,ep138,"So Laura's gotten him to agree to see a larger place she's found, but it's outside his search area."
131,ep138,I'm just getting big suburb vibes.
132,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
133,ep138,"This area does look pretty cute, but it just feels a little dead compared to inside the city."
134,ep138,I like to say it's quaint.
135,ep138,"Quaint, quiet."
136,ep138,Ryan's been pretty clear about not wanting to see properties that aren't in DC.
137,ep138,"But after seeing a small place with just one bathroom, he's gotten a little more flexible."
138,ep138,"We are in Old Town, Alexandria today."
139,ep138,We are gonna be seeing a semi-detached row home.
140,ep138,"It's listed at $745,000, you're basically three blocks from the metro, it's a 15-minute commute into the city."
141,ep138,So you're really not that far.
142,ep138,I really hope Ryan likes this one.
143,ep138,"It's a little bit outside of his geographical parameter, but this really has everything he's looking for, and it's at his price point."
144,ep138,I'm just getting big suburb vibes right here.
145,ep138,Yeah. don't know how I feel about it.
146,ep138,Definitely gonna have to change the colors here.
147,ep138,Yes. is not my style.
148,ep138,-Mmm-hmm. is easy to fix.
149,ep138,I would not say I'm super comfortable in the suburbs.
150,ep138,I want to leave the suburbs of living in my parents' house.
151,ep138,But I have an open mind.
152,ep138,Wow. not used to seeing so much space.
153,ep138,"This is 1,200 square feet total."
154,ep138,That's definitely the biggest house -that I've looked at.
155,ep138,Yeah. guess that's what happens when you go a bit out of the city.
156,ep138,"And I love how open it is, this is more than enough space for me, although, hopefully another person -in the future, too, and..."
157,ep138,-Yup. feel like I could even grow into this and start a family although that's so far in the future.
158,ep138,I have trouble thinking about it.
159,ep138,Right. I totally agree.
160,ep138,You really do have room to grow into it.
161,ep138,"Oh, wow, I couldn't even realize from the other room that this opens up."
162,ep138,"I love this feel, being able to cook while talking to whatever guests I have over."
163,ep138,"It's a beautiful kitchen, it has that antique kind of charm."
164,ep138,-It was built in 1918.
165,ep138,Mmm-hmm. most of the updates were done in the last four years.
166,ep138,"That's what I'm going for is, like, I want character but also I like to have nice new things."
167,ep138,"-So... starting to wish we could just like pick up this place, move it to DC."
168,ep138,If we pick this up and put it in DC it'd be over a million.
169,ep138,"Can't afford that yet, unfortunately."
170,ep138,Let's just see.
171,ep138,Plenty of space here.
172,ep138,"Yeah, this is a really nice backyard."
173,ep138,So you'll have your front porch.
174,ep138,"And then you have the back porch here, in addition to the yard, and then you have a detached garage."
175,ep138,This is so much outdoor space.
176,ep138,Like I can see myself just hosting a lot of friends over -plenty of room to grill.
177,ep138,And then...
178,ep138,My parents would definitely be happy that I'm getting this much space with my money.
179,ep138,Did they put you up to this?
180,ep138,They were telling me to look outside the city.
181,ep138,No. wants something very specific that's almost impossible to find.
182,ep138,"So I'm trying to get him to broaden his horizons, think outside the box."
183,ep138,"It basically meets his criteria, except it's outside of the exact geography that he wants to be, but it's much more space."
184,ep138,"I really think he could not only see himself here now but grow into it, see himself in five years or ten years."
185,ep138,I feel like these look a lot older than the rest of the house does on the first floor.
186,ep138,These are original.
187,ep138,"Huh, I..."
188,ep138,That's not my style.
189,ep138,"This feels more like a city bedroom, pretty small."
190,ep138,"Absolutely, yes."
191,ep138,"However, this is the third bedroom because a third bedroom does exist -in the house."
192,ep138,"-Oh, true."
193,ep138,With three bedrooms I could possibly rent some out.
194,ep138,"You could probably rent these rooms out, maybe for $1,000 each."
195,ep138,"I mean, you're really covering like two thirds of your mortgage."
196,ep138,This also has two full baths so you wouldn't have to share a bath with a roommate.
197,ep138,Okay. still can't get over just the difference in feel between the upper level and the lower level.
198,ep138,Downstairs is so modern and sleek looking.
199,ep138,And then you get upstairs and you immediately realize all the floors are old and creaky.
200,ep138,But it still has a lot to offer and is making me seriously consider not restricting myself to the city itself.
201,ep138,This is your main bedroom.
202,ep138,Look at all this space.
203,ep138,I don't really see much of that in DC.
204,ep138,So I am just excited at how much space I have.
205,ep138,"Yeah, you do have an en suite bath."
206,ep138,"Much more modern, this is much more my style."
207,ep138,Why didn't they just renovate the whole house?
208,ep138,"Some people like that old charm, -gives it a little character."
209,ep138,"-Mmm-hmm. you, okay."
210,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
211,ep138,"This place honestly has I think everything I'm looking for, outdoor space to grill and entertain, a nice kitchen that opens up to the dining area."
212,ep138,Yeah. of space.
213,ep138,"I'm, like, just a bit concerned about -how old the upstairs is."
214,ep138,"Okay. can't decide whether I wanna be outside of the city or not, but after seeing how far my money goes here I'm actually starting to think maybe I should increase how much I spend in the city."
215,ep138,I think I want to start looking in the...
216,ep138,"Even up to high 800s range, especially now that my parents aren't with me, don't tell them."
217,ep138,I'm really impressed.
218,ep138,You can go that high?
219,ep138,I've been saving a lot of money -with zero rent so.
220,ep138,-Yeah. want to consider those options.
221,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
222,ep138,"I'm seeing a place that's more expensive, but this is the heart of DC."
223,ep138,And I hope that by paying more I can get a lot more space.
224,ep138,"But Ryan, a 25-year-old software engineer is taking a big risk."
225,ep138,He's pushing his finances to the brink with this place.
226,ep138,-Hello. is quite the entrance.
227,ep138,I like what I see so far.
228,ep138,"So we know you saw it online, but this is a two-bed plus den listed at $899,000."
229,ep138,We're on the top floor here.
230,ep138,"It's a loft penthouse style, which is really nice."
231,ep138,"And it's 1,200 square feet."
232,ep138,I really like the feel and I was able to just bike right over here from work.
233,ep138,"This is what I love about the area, just so many shops and restaurants nearby."
234,ep138,That's why I'm willing to pay a premium to be in the city.
235,ep138,"I feel like my parents don't understand yet, but..."
236,ep138,So we'll go to the den first.
237,ep138,"Oh, this is small, but it's nice to have the extra space."
238,ep138,I think this area is a little farther in the city than I want for running purposes.
239,ep138,-That's like the...
240,ep138,"Mmm-hmm. I have, but that's the trade-off for having all of this literally right out the front door."
241,ep138,Let's go to the kitchen.
242,ep138,"It's nice to see that everything here is new, especially since I'm at the max of what I'd be willing to spend feels a little industrial."
243,ep138,Yeah. I don't know how I feel about it.
244,ep138,"But I love the open concept, I could have a bunch of friends over, family over, there's plenty of space for them as I'm over here learning how to cook."
245,ep138,Learning how to cook.
246,ep138,The hall bathroom is over this way.
247,ep138,Mmm-hmm. your second bedroom.
248,ep138,I really like the feel.
249,ep138,"It's just, you have the natural light."
250,ep138,Look at how big that window is.
251,ep138,I know.
252,ep138,I cannot believe what I can get in this location...
253,ep138,-Right. willing to pay a bit more and I could definitely rent this room out.
254,ep138,Help with the fact that it costs so much.
255,ep138,"No, absolutely."
256,ep138,"I mean, a room around here could rent for between $1,300 and $1,500 a month."
257,ep138,So that would really subsidize your mortgage -quite substantially.
258,ep138,-Yeah. like the sound of that.
259,ep138,And I know my parents also bring that up a lot as well.
260,ep138,"They think getting a roommate is a great idea, so."
261,ep138,It makes a lot of financial sense.
262,ep138,-This place is huge.
263,ep138,Here we are.
264,ep138,"It's one of the biggest bedrooms I've seen -in, you know, in DC, DC."
265,ep138,Mmm-hmm. feel like I honestly would not want the main bedroom because I like the exposed brick so much.
266,ep138,I would live there and try to rent this one out.
267,ep138,It's totally up to you.
268,ep138,"I could rent this one out for more, especially with this place being the max -I could possibly spend."
269,ep138,Right. one would definitely rent for more because it has the en suite bath.
270,ep138,And it does also have an extensive closet.
271,ep138,"I feel like I can already hear my parents being like, ""Oh, this is really expensive for, yes a lot of space, but not when you look elsewhere."""
272,ep138,"Sure, but the bottom line is that this holds its value."
273,ep138,"So whether you're getting a 5,000 square foot house or a 1,200 square foot condo, you're looking at it the trajectory over 10 years or over 20 years."
274,ep138,"And if you can rent out a bedroom, which you can, in this case, it just covers so much of your monthly mortgage."
275,ep138,So for you I think it makes a lot of sense financially.
276,ep138,Even though this place is more expensive than I had ever considered before with the ability to rent out one of the rooms here I think that could cover for it and make financial sense.
277,ep138,Does it have an outdoor space?
278,ep138,It does not have a dedicated outdoor space.
279,ep138,So that is really the one factor that I was thinking of that you really want -that you don't get with this.
280,ep138,-Yeah. really feel like I need some sort -of outdoor space to grill.
281,ep138,-Yeah. lot of factors.
282,ep138,I can't get over the main living space.
283,ep138,It's just so open.
284,ep138,"It's got the modern look, nice new things, got the exposed brick, that unique character."
285,ep138,"-Yeah. plenty of space, although it is hard for me to picture not having an outdoor space to grill, -and for running..."
286,ep138,-Mmm-hmm. a little far from the paths.
287,ep138,-I can afford this...
288,ep138,-Mm-hmm. the ability to rent out to other roommates.
289,ep138,"This is the location I want, it's in the city."
290,ep138,But it's a huge decision with a lot of money on the line.
291,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
292,ep138,I feel the closest I've ever felt to finally -pulling the trigger.
293,ep138,-That's wonderful.
294,ep138,It's time for Ryan to decide what he's willing to give up and what he's willing to spend.
295,ep138,If he plans on getting out of his parents' house and back to city life anytime soon.
296,ep138,There was the Georgetown Waterfront condo.
297,ep138,"The two bed, one bath."
298,ep138,Yeah. I feel like I just a part of me dies inside whenever I hear the one bath because if that thing had one and a half or two baths I feel like it would be very close.
299,ep138,It was just an amazing location.
300,ep138,"There was that balcony where I could put a grill, but there are no closets."
301,ep138,And it's the smallest out of all of them.
302,ep138,There was that row house in Alexandria that we visited.
303,ep138,"The whole first floor was new, modern..."
304,ep138,"Yeah. space, there was that huge yard that you cannot get in the city."
305,ep138,And then start going up those stairs from 1918.
306,ep138,"And it was like, oh, but there were three bedrooms, but I'm still just not sure I can see myself outside of the city."
307,ep138,-I get the city location.
308,ep138,Mmm-hmm. the space in that Logan Circle penthouse -that we looked at.
309,ep138,Mmm-hmm. I was willing to spend a bit more.
310,ep138,"It was modern, new, the location is in the heart of the city."
311,ep138,"Even though this place is the most expensive it still makes sense given how much I could rent out a bedroom for, but it is stretching me -as far as I can go."
312,ep138,-Right. I am really struggling to picture myself somewhere without an outdoor space.
313,ep138,[upbeat music playing]
314,ep138,[doorbell dings]
315,ep138,[knocks on door]
316,ep138,"Hey, Hey."
317,ep138,How's it going?
318,ep138,Come on in.
319,ep138,I decided to buy the Georgetown Waterfront condo.
320,ep138,Biggest factor for me ended up being location.
321,ep138,"There are so many shops, restaurants, and bars, not to mention running paths nearby."
322,ep138,The house itself also has this just really cute feel.
323,ep138,"There's so much natural light, and there's that cozy wood burning fireplace with the exposed brick."
324,ep138,Can you do me a favor and be my table for me and hold that.
325,ep138,-Thank you.
326,ep138,I sure can.
327,ep138,I definitely compromised a few things.
328,ep138,There's no closets and only one bathroom.
329,ep138,"There's not much dedicated outdoor space, but I have been enjoying spending time on my balcony and grilling."
330,ep138,I'll get plates.
331,ep138,I got it.
332,ep138,You guys are the guests for once.
333,ep138,Okay. is so strange having him serve us.
334,ep138,"Yeah. list price was $709,000."
335,ep138,"There were two other offers and so I just went up a bit more to $712,000."
336,ep138,And eventually we amended it back down so that I only did pay list price.
337,ep138,And I think that's a great deal.
338,ep138,I can't believe...
339,ep138,you own your own home at 25.
340,ep138,-Wow. know...
341,ep138,"-I mean, what were we doing at 25?"
342,ep138,"Yeah. seriously, congratulations."
343,ep138,I'm pretty proud of you.
344,ep138,"Oh, thanks."
345,ep138,I ended up making a huge decision almost against the will of my parents.
346,ep138,"I have looked to them for guidance for my entire life, so this was really new, nerve-wracking, and uncomfortable for me."
347,ep138,"But in the end, everything worked out."
348,ep138,I trusted my gut and went with the place that was right for me and just me.
349,ep138,"It feels really freeing and like I've taken a step in becoming an adult, an independent adult."
1,ep139,I like king.
2,ep139,"the columns here, makes me feel like the together."
3,ep139,"After two years of dating, Charlotte couple, Kenya and Yahya are eager to move to the next step in their relationship and buy a large home closet."
4,ep139,This is where I can see my me.
5,ep139,This is where you could see there.
6,ep139,TV right stuff.
7,ep139,-No shoes and here.
8,ep139,"-Obviously, we have a debate going on home."
9,ep139,"He is a first-time buyer, more comfortable with a lower priced small."
10,ep139,"-Well, this is kind of good."
11,ep139,This is small?
12,ep139,Kind of bedroom.
13,ep139,This is another wants.
14,ep139,"But this is her fourth place, and she's willing to spend to get the upgrades she huge."
15,ep139,-This kitchen is price.
16,ep139,Yes. bothers me a lot that she's not concerned about the dings]
17,ep139,[bell playing]
18,ep139,[theme music playing]
19,ep139,[upbeat music could...
20,ep139,I was thinking we sound?
21,ep139,"we could have some fajitas -for lunch, how does that perfect."
22,ep139,-Okay. best.
23,ep139,"I'm a car salesman, one of the technology."
24,ep139,And I work in healthcare ago.
25,ep139,"We met one night at a night club two years dance."""
26,ep139,"She comes out on the floor and just grabs me and say, ""Hey, let's sight."
27,ep139,He knew it was love at first hands.
28,ep139,Yup. me wash my day.
29,ep139,"I grew up in a country area in Virginia, outside from sun up to sun down, played all California."
30,ep139,"So, I grew up in San Diego, grandmother."
31,ep139,I was raised by my outside.
32,ep139,"Unlike Yahya, I don't recall playing books."
33,ep139,I was in the sometimes.
34,ep139,Yahya lightens me up because I can be very serious him.
35,ep139,It's never a dull moment with day.
36,ep139,I feel special getting lunch in the middle of the PhD.
37,ep139,Yahya moved to Charlotte for work and I relocated here to pursue with my together.
38,ep139,We currently in a rental and now we're looking to purchase a home Tyson?
39,ep139,Are you excited about finding our new home -for the two of us plus before.
40,ep139,Nervous. I've owned three homes together.
41,ep139,This will be my fourth home that we buy first.
42,ep139,And this would be my it.
43,ep139,"The reason why I never purchased a home before, I just didn't see the benefit of debt."
44,ep139,It was another mortgage.
45,ep139,"I had to break it down that when you are renting, basically, you're helping someone else pay their nervous?"
46,ep139,"So, what do you think is making you factor."
47,ep139,"The purchase, the money houses..."
48,ep139,I'm not buying me?
49,ep139,-Every five years like years.
50,ep139,-...every that.
51,ep139,"-No, I'm not doing home."
52,ep139,"Because this will be my fourth home, I want this house to be a kind of a graduation for my last $650,000."
53,ep139,"And so, because of that, I am willing to spend up to $500,000."
54,ep139,I'm willing to spend payment.
55,ep139,"That's a comfortable price, comfortable floor."
56,ep139,Guest bedroom on the first me.
57,ep139,"So, the first floor bedroom is important, for when my grandmother does come and visit 20s."
58,ep139,"And between the two of us, we have four children in their visit."
59,ep139,It is important that we'll have enough space for our adult kids to come and spaces.
60,ep139,"In all of my previous homes, I've always had very small closet island."
61,ep139,"One of my dreams is just to deck that thing out with a chandelier, an closet?"
62,ep139,How often are you gonna be in a lot.
63,ep139,"Well, once the chandelier and the island is there, I'll be in the closet a pool."
64,ep139,A pool.
65,ep139,"Growing up, I didn't have that much access to a ditch."
66,ep139,"If it rained in Virginia, we jumped in the do."
67,ep139,"I mean, no judgment, we had to do what we had to community."
68,ep139,"So, a pool is important to me, even if it's in a room."
69,ep139,-Entertainment around.
70,ep139,"Okay. family and friends come, you give them that extra room to be growing."
71,ep139,"We want a big backyard for Tyson because he is, you know, drop?"
72,ep139,Are you waiting for something to craftsman.
73,ep139,So I like a porch.
74,ep139,The reason why I like those is because they are two- storeys and they have a porch.
75,ep139,I love a mom.
76,ep139,Takes me back to my grandma and my exterior.
77,ep139,I really would like a craftsman all-brick side.
78,ep139,"It just has a warm, inviting curb appeal and my taste is more on the traditional sacrifice."
79,ep139,"I'm gonna prepare you, you know, there might be a couple things that we might have to it."
80,ep139,"Typically, I'm the type of person where I see something I like I just go ahead and get it, I execute him."
81,ep139,"But during this process, I need to slow down, incorporate some of his wants and needs, and then also take time to explain the process to closet."
82,ep139,But I'm still getting my chandelier in my wow.
83,ep139,"Oh, playing]"
84,ep139,[upbeat music one.
85,ep139,I think you're gonna be excited about this bedrooms.
86,ep139,-Okay. wow.
87,ep139,"-Oh, baths."
88,ep139,-Three and a half price?
89,ep139,-Okay. you want to know the yeah.
90,ep139,"-Oh, God."
91,ep139,"-$450,000. my baby."
92,ep139,"Let's go, city."
93,ep139,"One thing we're already giving up, it's 45 minutes away from the forever."
94,ep139,We had been driving life.
95,ep139,"But, you know, I'm cool with that because I love that country playing]"
96,ep139,[upbeat music nice.

111,ep139,"-Man. got a community ""Okay."
112,ep139,"When buyers have two different prices in mind, I typically kind of really dig deep and figure out what exactly does their ideal home look like and then we just, kind of, base it off of location, the amount of yard and space that they want, and really just drill down to, non-negotiables."""
113,ep139,These are your are.
114,ep139,And a lot of times it ends up being somewhere in between where the two ranges colors.
115,ep139,I like the neutral door.
116,ep139,Okay. the stairs are right here when we come in the in.
117,ep139,"What I dislike about walking into the home and seeing stairs, it's like you're rushing me to, kind of, hurry up and get stairs."
118,ep139,"And so, like, a nice foyer to me allows you to walk through the door, you can take a breath before you're presented with here..."
119,ep139,"Well, over space."
120,ep139,"-Okay. could, kind of, be your office openness."
121,ep139,I love the house.
122,ep139,"So, I do like that it's open but I prefer to have a door because sometimes my meetings I get a little loud, and so I don't wanna disturb everyone else in the area."
123,ep139,"Across the hall, you got the dining really."
124,ep139,"Wow. room, nice."
125,ep139,This is kitchen.
126,ep139,"This is nice, but my concern is it's so far from the kitchen."
127,ep139,It's not that far to get to the kitchen.
128,ep139,I don't think the dining room is too far from the kitchen.
129,ep139,"I mean, four, five steps, you're in the area."
130,ep139,"When you're in the kitchen and you're preparing meals, you wanna walk from the kitchen directly into your dining cook."
131,ep139,And Yahya wouldn't know that because he doesn't room.
132,ep139,-I'm loving this living windows.
133,ep139,Yeah. open to the kitchen and you got a lot of floors.
134,ep139,"I agree with everything you're saying, but I wish this was hardwood $450,000."
135,ep139,But it's still right.
136,ep139,-You're add...
137,ep139,"Maybe with $450,000 -Okay -we could floors."
138,ep139,"-$450,000, you couldn't ask -for hardwood point."

145,ep139,This is what this is here...
146,ep139,You sit kitchen.
147,ep139,But I wish it would be in the space.
148,ep139,I think it's a lot of mismatch.
149,ep139,I am noticing that the appliances -are kind of a appliances.
150,ep139,Okay. so we would have to buy some new like.
151,ep139,"Cooking is my passion and I would not consider the kitchen in this home a chef's kitchen, but every home I've purchased I know what I like and I know what I don't again."
152,ep139,And I know what I wouldn't do lens.
153,ep139,"And so when I'm looking at a home, I'm looking at it from that everything."
154,ep139,"For Yahya, this is his first home, so he's gonna be excited about is?"
155,ep139,You know what I think it buyer.
156,ep139,It feels more so like a home for a first-time home here.
157,ep139,"I'm not seeing the options to move, you know, for us to grow space."
158,ep139,"It's my first time, so I think this is a lot of space."

165,ep139,They bedroom.
166,ep139,"I mean, you do have the ability if you wanted to use this as a bedroom instead and the front room as an office to make that factor."
167,ep139,"Yeah, but that front room is open so I'm losing that privacy $450,000."
168,ep139,"We could always put a door in there, it's only playing]"
169,ep139,[upbeat music size.

196,ep139,"And the price is nice, amazing."
197,ep139,This house is priced is.
198,ep139,I think it's that price because of how far it city.

241,ep139,It's area.
242,ep139,Formal dining house.
243,ep139,"Again, the colors are so dark in this red."

247,ep139,"That's open, open."
248,ep139,It is room.

265,ep139,-[Bree here?
266,ep139,-You see this down backyard.
267,ep139,-Yeah. no dog.
268,ep139,Backyard is not big enough at all for the me.
269,ep139,It's not even big enough for here.
270,ep139,And it doesn't have a pool pool.
271,ep139,I would love my own pool but a community pool is better than no room?
272,ep139,How about this living king.
273,ep139,"I like the columns here, makes me feel like I'm the bae?"
274,ep139,"-What do you think, door."
275,ep139,"Well, it's definitely different and I think it's a shame that you can't see -that coming in through the front missing."

278,ep139,I get right.

290,ep139,"Did you notice that you can't put a king in here, you can only put a four-bed in queen."
291,ep139,"No, I think that's a room."
292,ep139,I think it would fit actually a king in this room.
293,ep139,-I do like this cluttered.
294,ep139,I think it's too.
295,ep139,"Well, it might be the furniture, -so..."
296,ep139,"We would never have this much furniture in our bedroom, pieces."

312,ep139,I just wish we had an extra bedroom downstairs for my her.
313,ep139,"She's 85 years old, and she's just at an age where just going up and down the stairs is just not good for with."
314,ep139,Use your imagination what you could fill this room up closet.

478,ep139,We had a long purchased...
479,ep139,"So, we it."
480,ep139,"The big, expensive house, but we only paid $615,000 for too."
481,ep139,-So... right.
482,ep139,All grandmother.
483,ep139,Tequila. house felt like it was right for us with the guest room on the first floor for my dreams.
484,ep139,But this home does not have the closet of my dreams.
485,ep139,"However, I am gonna compromise and take one of the bedrooms upstairs and turn that into the closet of my for."
486,ep139,"I think I'd compromise the most in this house because of the price, but she convinced me that, ""Hey, you get what you pay happy."""
487,ep139,"So, if you wanna be happy, if you wanna make this journey a long journey, you need to get something that's gonna make you us."
488,ep139,"And looking at this house, it did it, it did it for sounds]"
489,ep139,[makes cabinets.
490,ep139,Whoo. first thing we've already done is I painted the space.
491,ep139,It's already brightened up the backsplash.
492,ep139,"And our next project, I will be replacing the Tyson."
493,ep139,"Good job, job."
494,ep139,Good yard.
495,ep139,Tyson's enjoying the around.
496,ep139,He's out there playing and running in?
497,ep139,What's gonna happen with all this space for Tyson when we put a pool pool.
498,ep139,"So, we didn't get a pool in this home but the plan is probably in five or six months we will be looking to break ground on a boy."
499,ep139,"Yay. you go, memories."
500,ep139,"The best part about getting this home together at this stage of our relationship is that you know what, we have somewhere where we could make together."
501,ep139,"We have a place for our family and friends to come and make memories with us, and it gives us the opportunity to grow"
1,ep140,This be your office.
2,ep140,There's pocket doors.
3,ep140,"So, you know, if the kids are being loud..."
4,ep140,-Okay. good.
5,ep140,-...shut door.
6,ep140,"Since Bob and Jennifer work from home, they're desperate to trade their place outside Chicago for one with a closed floor plan."
7,ep140,They get some separation from their four kids.
8,ep140,I want nothing to do in open concept layout from now on.
9,ep140,"Problem is, a spacious home with five bedrooms and two offices won't come cheap."
10,ep140,It's a nice neighborhood.
11,ep140,-It does scream money.
12,ep140,-But won't you rather buy a house in a nice neighborhood?
13,ep140,"And with her plans for a high-end update, Bob's having a hard time keeping their spending under control."
14,ep140,"$950,000. all the work, all the upgrades, it's just not move-in ready."
15,ep140,He just need to get over that.
16,ep140,-Are we all making something at once?
17,ep140,-Yes. a corporate social media working consultant.
18,ep140,I'm a sales executive at a food and beverage company.
19,ep140,So we've been together for eight years.
20,ep140,I have three children from previous marriage.
21,ep140,My first husband died in 2013.
22,ep140,Bob came in the picture and we got married at the end of 2015.
23,ep140,"Bob is a really, really nice guy."
24,ep140,So that's like the number one thing that I love about him.
25,ep140,"And also, he has a great sense of humor."
26,ep140,She has just made me a better person in all elements of my life.
27,ep140,He went from being a single guy to a father of three.
28,ep140,"I love, love being a dad."
29,ep140,"Leo, where are you?"
30,ep140,I'm right here.
31,ep140,"A year after we got married, we welcomed baby number four."
32,ep140,And it's just a little bit crazy all the time.
33,ep140,Got you.
34,ep140,We live in the town of Burr Ridge.
35,ep140,Right outside of Chicago.
36,ep140,"But after living here for four years with four kids, there are things about this home that are not working for us."
37,ep140,We really want our own office space.
38,ep140,That has to happen.
39,ep140,"We both work from home a lot, and the kids are doing remote school."
40,ep140,I'm working in my bedroom and I can't stand it.
41,ep140,"My office is in the basement, so, I hear stomping above me."
42,ep140,It's like a herd of elephants.
43,ep140,This house is open concept.
44,ep140,There's not a single quiet place.
45,ep140,I want nothing to do in open concept layout from now on.
46,ep140,"We want a more traditional layout that has fine rooms and areas, would love to see some doors to close off a room."
47,ep140,"Obviously, the five bedrooms has got to happen."
48,ep140,"Right now, our older sons bedroom is on the first floor."
49,ep140,It sometimes makes him a little bit nervous.
50,ep140,"So, we're really looking to find a house where all of the kids bedrooms could be upstairs."
51,ep140,A huge backyard.
52,ep140,I would be fine having a little bit smaller yard.
53,ep140,"So, that it would be a little more manageable for us."
54,ep140,"A lot of like, older homes have this square footage and rooms and things like that."
55,ep140,"Yeah, if it's an older home is it gonna be move-in ready."
56,ep140,I love the modern architecture.
57,ep140,Nice clean lines.
58,ep140,My style is a little bit more classic.
59,ep140,I have been really into decorating my own homes for quite some time now.
60,ep140,My mom also is really into interior decorating.
61,ep140,She went to school for it.
62,ep140,I do love a good project.
63,ep140,"There's something about this house, like, being like, done, that I'm like, ""Oh, now there's nothing to do."""
64,ep140,I'm definitely more practical.
65,ep140,Jennifer is the decision maker.
66,ep140,-She can make a decision pretty quickly.
67,ep140,"Oh, yeah."
68,ep140,-I will hem and haw a little bit more.
69,ep140,-Hmm-mmm. I'm thinking about the cost factor.
70,ep140,"As I assume the fatherly role, in the family, is definitely stressful and more pressure on having to help provide for a larger family."
71,ep140,And I embrace it.
72,ep140,And I love being able to do that for my family.
73,ep140,We live outside of Chicago.
74,ep140,And that would put you in a certain price range.
75,ep140,-No more than a million.
76,ep140,-I know.
77,ep140,"And that one million is all including the renovations, work, any type of adjustments, or any enhancements to the house."
78,ep140,I like this neighborhood.
79,ep140,"Yeah, it's actually not far from where we live right now."
80,ep140,I feel like the kids can ride their bikes and stuff and it's pretty safe.
81,ep140,You should slow down.
82,ep140,You're driving really fast through some of those trees.
83,ep140,-I'm driving 50 miles per hour.
84,ep140,"-No, you're not."
85,ep140,Slow down.
86,ep140,We're not in a rush.
87,ep140,"Oh, it's pretty great."
88,ep140,It's definitely very classic architecture.
89,ep140,"Hi, guys."
90,ep140,-Hello. it going?
91,ep140,"All right, so, what do you think of this house?"
92,ep140,Wow. got a really grand feel to it.
93,ep140,Absolutely. it's freezing.
94,ep140,"So, let's get inside and check it out."
95,ep140,Sounds good.
96,ep140,"So, what Jennifer and Bob are looking for, here in Burr Ridge, is a little bit difficult to find, because they do need five bedrooms."
97,ep140,"While most homes around here under a million, usually have about four."
98,ep140,But I'm keeping an open mind on finding some properties that might need a little bit of work.
99,ep140,"Because in their budget, with five bedrooms, that's sort of what we're gonna run into."
100,ep140,"The only issue we're gonna have is, Bob is just gonna see, dollar signs, dollar signs, dollar signs."
101,ep140,"Oh, oh my..."
102,ep140,Five bedrooms.
103,ep140,Four full bathrooms.
104,ep140,"And it's priced at 950,000."
105,ep140,This home is an estate sale.
106,ep140,Hopefully there will be some flexibility without price.
107,ep140,"Look at all the moldings, there's a lot of work in this house."
108,ep140,Definitely not loving the orange marbles.
109,ep140,"So, that could be taken care of."
110,ep140,Beautiful formal.
111,ep140,I love it.
112,ep140,Tell me what year is this again?
113,ep140,This house was built in the '80s.
114,ep140,-I can see that.
115,ep140,-Yes. definitely need some updating.
116,ep140,"But, space, layout, those are the things that you can't change."
117,ep140,Updated feel from the '80s or '90s is not what I'm looking for.
118,ep140,"I'm looking for more modern, ready to move-in."
119,ep140,The last thing I wanna do is put a ton of money to this house.
120,ep140,This could be your office.
121,ep140,There's pocket doors.
122,ep140,"So, you know, if the kids are being loud, -shut the doors."
123,ep140,-That's good.
124,ep140,I love these actually.
125,ep140,These are really cool.
126,ep140,Sun room.
127,ep140,"So, there's no yard?"
128,ep140,-There's no backyard.
129,ep140,-Backyard. of a side yard.
130,ep140,There's a beautiful patio here with pavers.
131,ep140,"So, the kids will just play in the side yard?"
132,ep140,They can play in the side yard or the front yard.
133,ep140,Okay. missing half of the yard.
134,ep140,There's a side yard but not a back yard.
135,ep140,"It would be nice if you had a yard, my kids could use that."
136,ep140,Family room.
137,ep140,It's very pink.
138,ep140,"Oh, it's a cute little '70s wet bar."
139,ep140,"This was the thing, back in the day."
140,ep140,"I mean, this house has a ton of upgrades for that time period."
141,ep140,This is '80s fancy.
142,ep140,"-Wow. think I need a drink, though."
143,ep140,I think the layout's great.
144,ep140,This is sort of like opposite of what we have in our current home where everything is open.
145,ep140,This is like a little bit more compartmentalized.
146,ep140,I definitely don't love the cabinets.
147,ep140,But I do like the layout.
148,ep140,Everything is like spread out.
149,ep140,It's not like a traffic jam like our current kitchen.
150,ep140,I can see better flow.
151,ep140,Let's go check out the upstairs.
152,ep140,Let's go.
153,ep140,I just really love the coating all the way up the stairs.
154,ep140,I'm trying to find something to love.
155,ep140,You're gonna love this.
156,ep140,Five bedrooms upstairs.
157,ep140,So this would be your main suite.
158,ep140,It's a nice sized room.
159,ep140,It could work for us.
160,ep140,I like the vaulted ceilings.
161,ep140,Trying to be positive.
162,ep140,And this is the office.
163,ep140,It's nice.
164,ep140,"Gives me a little more separation, from the bedroom than I currently have."
165,ep140,It's the best place to hide from your kids.
166,ep140,That's a really good point.
167,ep140,Three toilets in one bathroom.
168,ep140,[Jennifer laughing]
169,ep140,You could have a fancy pink for today.
170,ep140,"Upgrades, Bob."
171,ep140,Upgrades. is not an upgrade.
172,ep140,We have different definitions of what an upgrade is.
173,ep140,"My definition of an upgrade is a bathroom, that I don't wanna runaway from."
174,ep140,All the bedrooms are about the same size.
175,ep140,"This one, has it's own on-suite private bath."
176,ep140,It would really be nice of your daughter to not have to share a bathroom with the boys.
177,ep140,I agree.
178,ep140,We'll just have to get rid of everything in here.
179,ep140,"So, 950,000 dollars."
180,ep140,All this could be yours.
181,ep140,"And all the work and all the upgrades and all the blue toilets, we would have to change."
182,ep140,"Right. you are interested in this house, we would try to get that number down a little so you could do some needed upgrading."
183,ep140,"The most important thing about this search is, being able to have the family continue to thrive."
184,ep140,"I'm the first to raise my hand and ask, how much this thing costs?"
185,ep140,They've gotta really talk this price down for me to even be interested.
186,ep140,"I like how everything can be compartmentalized or you can, you know, open it up."
187,ep140,It's very classic.
188,ep140,It's not really ever gonna go out of style.
189,ep140,It's got a really great layout.
190,ep140,And I think it could be perfect for our family.
191,ep140,It's just not move-in ready.
192,ep140,Look at how much work has to be done in this house.
193,ep140,It's a lot.
194,ep140,"If we do go with this house, it will be like, the biggest project that I've ever taken on."
195,ep140,"But, I can do it."
196,ep140,"I'm confident, I can get it all together."
197,ep140,It just feels like there's too much that needs to be done with this house to take it on.
198,ep140,"So, their broker showing them home is much more in line than what Bob wants to spend."
199,ep140,And much more move in ready.
200,ep140,And it's priced at 899.
201,ep140,"Oh, yeah."
202,ep140,That sounds great to me.
203,ep140,"Bob and Jennifer need a home for their family of six that gives them, each their own defined spaces."
204,ep140,"Today, they are seeing one that's less of a project for Bob."
205,ep140,"It is five bed rooms and it has some like, new renovations."
206,ep140,And it's priced at 899.
207,ep140,"Oh, yeah."
208,ep140,That sounds great to me.
209,ep140,I'm not so sure of the color of the brick.
210,ep140,It's like a big house though.
211,ep140,Bob and Jennifer are definitely Yin and Yang.
212,ep140,Jennifer is looking more from the style.
213,ep140,And Bob is more of a numbers guy.
214,ep140,He's really gonna like the price point.
215,ep140,"But I'm also a little concerned because, one of the bed rooms is on the main floor, and I know they really wanted five up, but that's extremely difficult to find."
216,ep140,"Hey, guys."
217,ep140,Come on in.
218,ep140,Wow. entry way is like really crammed.
219,ep140,"I feel like when you walk into a house, you should feel a little bit more special."
220,ep140,It just feels like everything is so low.
221,ep140,This would be your formal.
222,ep140,This is a good sized room.
223,ep140,The ceilings seem really low to me.
224,ep140,The ceilings are nine foot ceilings.
225,ep140,I think you're used to like ten foot.
226,ep140,"The ceilings are a little bit lower, but I don't think that's bad."
227,ep140,Actually I feel really cold in this room.
228,ep140,[all laughing]
229,ep140,We're going through the French doors into the family room.
230,ep140,It's open to the kitchen.
231,ep140,I like this built in.
232,ep140,This is nice.
233,ep140,"Fireplace, compact yet modern."
234,ep140,I like that there are built in's but I just don't like this layout at all.
235,ep140,I wanted to have a little bit more separation.
236,ep140,"I think, the problem that I have with this house is that there are too many different styles."
237,ep140,There's craftsman elements.
238,ep140,"Then there's very traditional, then there's modern."
239,ep140,Then there's somewhat weird like Chip 'n' Dale and kind of like King George looking thing.
240,ep140,It's just a mish mosh.
241,ep140,"But, I'm only going to put in the effort to change something in a house if I like the layout and I really like the house."
242,ep140,Kitchen was recently upgraded.
243,ep140,It's got granite counter top.
244,ep140,This island is really nice.
245,ep140,It's kind of shaped differently.
246,ep140,"But I feel like, it's got enough space for the whole family."
247,ep140,I don't know.
248,ep140,"I mean, I think it's great that it has cabinets that go to the ceilings."
249,ep140,"Appliances looks newer, that's a good thing."
250,ep140,And this one's got a fantastic yard.
251,ep140,"Oh, wow."
252,ep140,Beautiful pergola.
253,ep140,-That's cool.
254,ep140,"Oh, yeah."
255,ep140,I love the built in grill over there.
256,ep140,Yeah. really like to barbeque in summers.
257,ep140,"So, that would definitely be nice."
258,ep140,The back yard is really big.
259,ep140,"So, it's perfect for the kids."
260,ep140,This is the main level bedroom.
261,ep140,It's a really good sized room.
262,ep140,"Yeah, it is okay."
263,ep140,"I mean, it would be nice if this could be an office for us."
264,ep140,But we would use it as a bedroom.
265,ep140,There's four bed rooms up here.
266,ep140,"So, this could be one of the kids rooms."
267,ep140,All the kids rooms are about the same size.
268,ep140,I love how this is kind of carved out with the windows and everything.
269,ep140,Here you have your main suite.
270,ep140,I like it.
271,ep140,High ceilings.
272,ep140,Feels much bigger.
273,ep140,Bathroom. is updated.
274,ep140,I love the ceilings.
275,ep140,It feels big in here.
276,ep140,I love that they're taller.
277,ep140,Yeah. do too.
278,ep140,This actually has an office off the bedroom.
279,ep140,This is nice.
280,ep140,This is like a hidden room.
281,ep140,"There's a really nice, basement downstairs."
282,ep140,With a bathroom and an office.
283,ep140,Great space.
284,ep140,Yeah. think it could be nice in here.
285,ep140,We could put the swiss ball table.
286,ep140,"And air hokey table, they'll have a place to hang out."
287,ep140,"So, where's the other office you were talking about?"
288,ep140,That is over here.
289,ep140,Oh there's a sauna here.
290,ep140,That's nice.
291,ep140,This could be partial office.
292,ep140,May be a little bit of a workout area.
293,ep140,You don't like working in the basement.
294,ep140,I don't but I have a sauna now.
295,ep140,"So, I think I might like it a little bit."
296,ep140,[all laughing]
297,ep140,I like the house.
298,ep140,I like all the renovations multiple offices.
299,ep140,I'm not feeling it.
300,ep140,I don't like the layout.
301,ep140,The layout seems really like awkward.
302,ep140,"I feel like some of the rooms, they're not really broken up."
303,ep140,It is below what we wanna spend.
304,ep140,It's basically move-in ready.
305,ep140,And I think there's a lot of great features of this house.
306,ep140,It's really difficult to find a five bedroom home.
307,ep140,"With two offices within the 900,000 dollar range."
308,ep140,It is definitely below for what we wanna pay for.
309,ep140,"So, I'm totally in tune to that."
310,ep140,It has actually a lot of upgrades.
311,ep140,And the backyard is pretty big.
312,ep140,"But since, Jennifer isn't sold, their broker's lined up a bigger, more grand house."
313,ep140,And it's making Bob nervous.
314,ep140,"It better be nice, for a million 75."
315,ep140,It's a nice neighborhood.
316,ep140,It does scream money.
317,ep140,Wouldn't you rather buy a house in a nice neighborhood?
318,ep140,"It is five bedroom, and the price is -a million 75."
319,ep140,-Oh! houses are all so nice.
320,ep140,It better be nice for a million 75.
321,ep140,I really love the brick on the house.
322,ep140,It's really pretty.
323,ep140,I love it right away.
324,ep140,"The home that I'm showing Bob and Jennifer, is gonna be really a great fit."
325,ep140,It's got pretty much everything that they are looking for.
326,ep140,Great layout.
327,ep140,6000 square feet.
328,ep140,There are five bedrooms.
329,ep140,It's got a great back yard.
330,ep140,There's been a lot of updates and a lot of upgrades.
331,ep140,"So, I think it's all gonna balance out with that price range."
332,ep140,This is really nice.
333,ep140,"Yeah, it is."
334,ep140,I love the stairway and this entry way and everything.
335,ep140,This is really nice.
336,ep140,Nice also means...
337,ep140,Money. you think we could do a little bit better on the price?
338,ep140,"Absolutely. mean, this is a competitive market."
339,ep140,But generally people are negotiable.
340,ep140,"So, this will be the formal."
341,ep140,The layout makes sense to me.
342,ep140,"This is sort of like, the opposite of what we have in our current home right now."
343,ep140,"This is like, it's a little bit more compartmentalized."
344,ep140,"So, the kitchen was recently redone."
345,ep140,This kitchen also feels like it has some character to it.
346,ep140,I really love the ceilings.
347,ep140,The cabinets got a stair step up.
348,ep140,And it just gives it a little bit of a different feel.
349,ep140,"Although there are some new renovations at this home, there are still some updates that need to be done."
350,ep140,"Pink color, but overall, I really like the layout of the kitchen."
351,ep140,Wow. is about the nicest breakfast room.
352,ep140,I like how it has the windows to the backyard.
353,ep140,The backyard is 0.7
354,ep140,of an acre.
355,ep140,And it also has an outdoor kitchen and an outdoor bar area.
356,ep140,I love the back yard.
357,ep140,And then there's like space for the kids to play.
358,ep140,Let's go check out the family room.
359,ep140,It's nice and separated from the kitchen.
360,ep140,-Look at these high ceilings.
361,ep140,"-Wow, that is high."
362,ep140,-How high is that?
363,ep140,-25 feet.
364,ep140,-It'll be my guess.
365,ep140,-[all laugh]
366,ep140,You're not gonna be changing any light bulbs.
367,ep140,-No. for sure.
368,ep140,I know you were looking for the five bedrooms upstairs.
369,ep140,"This one only has four, but there is this great spot."
370,ep140,-You can either use it as an office.
371,ep140,-Wow! you can use it as a bedroom.
372,ep140,"The two of us would not be able to share an office though, so we would have to make this a bedroom."
373,ep140,"Okay, there is another area in the basement -where I think two offices would work."
374,ep140,-Okay. don't like how that sounds at all.
375,ep140,This would be the main suite.
376,ep140,This is nice.
377,ep140,-Be cozy in bed and turn on the fire.
378,ep140,"-Oh, yeah."
379,ep140,[both laugh]
380,ep140,-This could really work for us.
381,ep140,-Yeah. my!
382,ep140,We're definitely gonna need some work in here.
383,ep140,What's wrong with the bathroom?
384,ep140,I'm not really a fan of the counter tops or the plumbing fixtures.
385,ep140,"As we go into each room, Jennifer wants to change something."
386,ep140,"I think the house is fine, but someone's gotta watch how much we're spending on all these changes because we're already over our spending price."
387,ep140,That makes me nervous.
388,ep140,So there are three bedrooms on this side.
389,ep140,I also like the fact that the main suite is so much farther away from these three bedrooms.
390,ep140,"Yeah, I like that too."
391,ep140,[chuckles softly]
392,ep140,And I love how all the bedrooms have a different style to it.
393,ep140,This could be the party room.
394,ep140,"Wow! I know you need a space to work from home, so I'm hoping that this basement is gonna work out for you."
395,ep140,"Yeah, this definitely could be an office."
396,ep140,The basement is really large.
397,ep140,"You could probably, you know, make a space somewhere, put a drywall, a door to give her an office as well."
398,ep140,"Wow, is there a kitchen down here?"
399,ep140,Oh! a bar area with a fridge.
400,ep140,And the kids can have friends over and hang out down here.
401,ep140,-I like this.
402,ep140,-I really like the set up.
403,ep140,"Well, this would be a really good space for us -to put like the air hockey table."
404,ep140,-Yeah? a foosball table.
405,ep140,"It's a great multi-functional space for us, and I think, it's definitely a good selling point about this house."
406,ep140,It has pretty much everything that we're looking for and there's a lot of space for us all.
407,ep140,It's a nice house.
408,ep140,It's got a lot of things that we want.
409,ep140,What worries me is that we're already over a million dollars here.
410,ep140,Then the other issue is that -we would have to have one of the kids' bedrooms downstairs.
411,ep140,-Yeah. we were looking for a house with all upstairs.
412,ep140,Right. really wants to keep the finances in control.
413,ep140,Jennifer wants the home for her family and she wants everything to be perfect.
414,ep140,"If Jennifer is willing to give up a few things, maybe Bob would be willing to spend a little bit more money."
415,ep140,"Jennifer and I, we have a lot to talk about."
416,ep140,"We've got to make a right decision for our family, and for both of us."
417,ep140,"Jennifer just texted, she wants to know where we stand on the houses."
418,ep140,"After a year of living in close quarters, Bob and Jennifer are looking to ditch their open concept and find a more traditional home."
419,ep140,But they have to decide between renovations or price.
420,ep140,How about that red brick Georgian?
421,ep140,"Five bedrooms, it's four baths, and all of the kids' bedrooms would be upstairs."
422,ep140,There are two private offices and I love the layout of the house.
423,ep140,I think about all the renovations we wanted to do.
424,ep140,"Kitchen remodel, main bathroom remodel."
425,ep140,Everything kept adding.
426,ep140,"What about that traditional house for $899,000?"
427,ep140,"I mean, this house is ready for move-in."
428,ep140,That main bedroom had a tucked away office.
429,ep140,The backyard was huge.
430,ep140,And it did have that nice outdoor kitchen.
431,ep140,"I know you like the price, but the entire floor plan, it's all like crunched together."
432,ep140,"-What about that brick home that came in a $1,750,000?"
433,ep140,-Yeah. layout just really made sense for us.
434,ep140,There is that fantastic staircase.
435,ep140,I loved that breakfast nook area that overlooked the backyard.
436,ep140,Everything was separate.
437,ep140,I didn't like the price.
438,ep140,That makes me nervous.
439,ep140,[doorbell ringing]
440,ep140,And then these ones are a little bit lighter.
441,ep140,They are little lighter.
442,ep140,We went with the red brick Georgian.
443,ep140,"The home was listed for $950,000."
444,ep140,"Jennifer really encouraged us to go in with a lower offer because it was an estate sale and just also based on coms in the area, she knew we could get a better price."
445,ep140,"We initially offered $775,000 and they did accept that offer."
446,ep140,"After the home inspection, we asked for an additional $50,000 price reduction based on the amount of repairs."
447,ep140,"So, ultimately we got the house for $725,000."
448,ep140,"I'm super excited that we got the house for this price and if we didn't, there's no way we'd have bought this house."
449,ep140,"The layout is just fantastic with all five of the bedrooms upstairs, and the fact that there are two private offices."
450,ep140,My favorite part of the house is my new office.
451,ep140,It's tucked away from the rest of the house -so I'm gonna get some peace and quiet on my calls.
452,ep140,-Mm-hm. really love the layout of the first floor.
453,ep140,"There are a lot of pocket doors in between rooms so we can have it opened up or if we want, we could just close the pocket doors."
454,ep140,"So, we're gonna keep the same overall layout for the kitchen."
455,ep140,It will just be a lot better.
456,ep140,I just wanna make sure we have enough room for all the kids to move around.
457,ep140,"Right now, we're in the middle of the renovation."
458,ep140,"All in, it's gonna cost us about a $175,000, but with the $225,000 price reduction we got on the house, it totally makes it worth it."
459,ep140,"So even with the renovations, -we ended up below what we wanted to spend."
460,ep140,-Mm-hm. that works for me.
461,ep140,And I get to make it look exactly the way I want it.
462,ep140,This is a very classic architectural design.
463,ep140,And I think I'm going to keep it more classic and timeless.
464,ep140,"Keeping a lot of the existing carpentry work, but just putting my own twist on everything."
465,ep140,-It's gonna be great.
466,ep140,-I really like the veining of this tile.
467,ep140,I'm still a little bit nervous about this house.
468,ep140,"I don't quite see the vision quite yet of what this house is gonna look like, but I know with Jennifer, she's gonna be able to make this house look amazing."
1,ep141,"Oh, wow."
2,ep141,See the sky!
3,ep141,"I mean, in the shower, this is great."
4,ep141,"Luke and Rachel are ready to start a family in Cleveland, Ohio, and to her, that means buying a cozy charmer."
5,ep141,I really like this.
6,ep141,"It feels warm and homey, that little area."
7,ep141,I love it.
8,ep141,But Luke isn't interested in cozy.
9,ep141,He wants his first home to be a statement.
10,ep141,"Now, this is what I'm talking about, like, it's from the future."
11,ep141,I don't think this is safe for kids or our parents to get up and down.
12,ep141,"And since this self-described type A couple has a hard time compromising, neither one is giving in without a fight."
13,ep141,I can tell what you're thinking.
14,ep141,-What? like this kitchen.
15,ep141,I did not say that.
16,ep141,This is a corrugated metal box.
17,ep141,I love it.
18,ep141,[doorbell rings]
19,ep141,[theme music playing]
20,ep141,"Uh, which we have tonight?"
21,ep141,"Just, I'll have the surprise."
22,ep141,"I used to be, I used to be a bartender, so..."
23,ep141,We met at our company Christmas party.
24,ep141,We used to work together in Wisconsin.
25,ep141,She was in product development and I was in sales.
26,ep141,"I remember the very beginning stages, when we first started dating..."
27,ep141,You were over communicative.
28,ep141,"I was like, whoa, who is this guy?"
29,ep141,"But he was still personable, charming, obviously."
30,ep141,"I'll have a surprise cocktail, please."
31,ep141,"Rachel is very smart, very determined."
32,ep141,"Being married to her does also mean being able to take some direction, but she's right most of the time."
33,ep141,[ice cubes shaking]
34,ep141,Don't shake it so much.
35,ep141,It's too loud.
36,ep141,"Okay. moved to Cleveland from Madison, Wisconsin."
37,ep141,Rachel got a great job here.
38,ep141,"The last year and a half, we've really fallen in love with the city."
39,ep141,We have a two-bedroom apartment.
40,ep141,The best thing about our apartment is the location.
41,ep141,"There's a park that we run and walk to pretty much every single day, but space is definitely becoming a problem."
42,ep141,I really love music and I'm really getting tired of cramming instruments under the bed.
43,ep141,Her bathroom closet is all of our kitchen supplies-- Every kitchen appliance you could possibly want.
44,ep141,I'm a food scientist.
45,ep141,"So, my job is testing ingredients, flavors."
46,ep141,"So, that's really critical that I have an updated kitchen."
47,ep141,"I want lots of counter space, island, storage for all my appliances."
48,ep141,"So, we go back out tomorrow, look at some more houses?"
49,ep141,Yeah. excited.
50,ep141,I've rented my whole life.
51,ep141,I'm 40 years old and this is my first home purchase.
52,ep141,"So, it did take me a little while to become an adult, go to bed a little earlier, you know, maybe not staying out at nightclubs or bars."
53,ep141,It's happening.
54,ep141,It's one thing to browse.
55,ep141,And the next is a kid.
56,ep141,"You know, that's kind of a lot for me."
57,ep141,Let's start with a house and we'll go from there.
58,ep141,We've been married almost two years.
59,ep141,We're ready to start a family and we're ready for...
60,ep141,-We're ready to move on to...
61,ep141,-To graduate.
62,ep141,...have space.
63,ep141,Luke always works from home and I'm working from the kitchen table and he's in the other room talking very loud on a conference call.
64,ep141,We need somewhere that we're not working on top of each other.
65,ep141,"So, I can have an office."
66,ep141,Luke can have an office.
67,ep141,"That could also be a music studio, that could also be a workout center."
68,ep141,"We want a place for guests, our own bedroom, a potential child's room."
69,ep141,"So, I saw this really nice updated, uh, Craftsman, just a couple blocks over from here."
70,ep141,"I'm looking for something that feels really cozy, but Craftsman and Colonial really feel that way to me."
71,ep141,It feels very warm and comforting.
72,ep141,"There's that other one you said that came on the market, that custom house."
73,ep141,"Because I'm a little bit more of a creative person, I want something as unique as possible."
74,ep141,If there was some way we could find something -that's really modern and unique-- -A home from the future?
75,ep141,Yeah. want to be able to walk the park and the restaurants.
76,ep141,I'm with you with the park.
77,ep141,I'm the more cost-conscious of the two of us.
78,ep141,I don't want to have to stop going out to eat or traveling less.
79,ep141,Those are things that are really important to me.
80,ep141,"So, I would feel more comfortable if we stayed around $500,000."
81,ep141,"You know, when I grew up, sometimes we didn't always have the extras, and it's so important to me that we get the best house that we can find."
82,ep141,"And if it takes a little bit more money to get that, then I have no problem with that."
83,ep141,I want to make sure we enjoy it with our new family.
84,ep141,Right. just don't want to be having to do nothing but sit at home because we spent it all on the house.
85,ep141,"As first-time buyers, I think there's some fear in making the wrong decision."
86,ep141,We are a little more type A and those strong personalities can kind of fight each other.
87,ep141,"First up, they're meeting their agent Lindsay at a newer build charmer about 15 minutes from their current neighborhood."
88,ep141,It's cute.
89,ep141,"I mean, we just passed ten of these houses."
90,ep141,Stop. have to give it a chance.
91,ep141,We're a long way from the park at this point.
92,ep141,"Yeah. a little farther than we would like, but it is really cute."
93,ep141,I like the porch a lot and the columns.
94,ep141,It doesn't really stand out that much though.
95,ep141,"-Hey, guys!"
96,ep141,"Hey, Lindsay."
97,ep141,"Hey, Lindsay."
98,ep141,The biggest challenge working with Luke and Rachel is to marry the two tastes together.
99,ep141,"This house was built a couple of years ago, and this definitely has like a contemporary kind of Colonial feel."
100,ep141,"I think it's going to be a decent blend, but it's definitely probably more Rachel's style."
101,ep141,"-So, is at 424.9."
102,ep141,-I love that.
103,ep141,Yeah. kind of floors are these?
104,ep141,These are an engineered hardwood.
105,ep141,-They don't pop very much.
106,ep141,Okay. really like this little nook.
107,ep141,It just feels warm and homey in that little area.
108,ep141,I love it.
109,ep141,"I see that it's updated, but I really want modern."
110,ep141,"When people come in here, I want them to go, ""Wow, this is a really cool house."""
111,ep141,"I know, but it's not homey."
112,ep141,It's not comfortable.
113,ep141,I just don't see us in the space like that.
114,ep141,We just got inside.
115,ep141,Let's look around.
116,ep141,"I mean, look at the kitchen."
117,ep141,This is awesome.
118,ep141,So much counter space and you know I love the gas range and the oven looks brand new.
119,ep141,Yeah. home is only two years old.
120,ep141,The white cabinets are trendy.
121,ep141,So much more storage space than we already have.
122,ep141,I like the subway tile on the back.
123,ep141,What about this wall?
124,ep141,Would we keep this?
125,ep141,-I like that.
126,ep141,-Okay. let's just take a peek at the backyard because it's so cold outside today.
127,ep141,"I feel like half of it was taken up by the cement, but I guess I could put a basketball hoop or something."
128,ep141,You're being negative about the size.
129,ep141,You're not going to find a huge yard in the city.
130,ep141,The owner's suite is in the front here.
131,ep141,And it also has a walk-in closet.
132,ep141,Okay. too bad.
133,ep141,"I really liked this natural light, those windows are really nice."
134,ep141,And I think a king bed could definitely fit in here.
135,ep141,Double sinks.
136,ep141,Definitely love and need that.
137,ep141,We do.
138,ep141,"Oh, big shower there."
139,ep141,And the subway tile just like downstairs.
140,ep141,Yeah. kind of pretty.
141,ep141,Let's take a look at the first bedroom on the left.
142,ep141,Solid size.
143,ep141,I really would like an office that I can close the door in.
144,ep141,-Okay. would work really well for that.
145,ep141,"Still not feeling it, Luke?"
146,ep141,"I mean, it's like every other house in the block."
147,ep141,"Wow. may be our first home, but I'm not really looking for a starter home."
148,ep141,I really want a house with some style.
149,ep141,That's why I'm willing to spend a little more money.
150,ep141,I want a little more space.
151,ep141,That's really what I'm looking for.
152,ep141,This bath is really large.
153,ep141,Yeah. a great size.
154,ep141,And this the third bedroom.
155,ep141,It's a little larger.
156,ep141,It could be a good nursery.
157,ep141,Yeah. nice size.
158,ep141,I still haven't seen anything that would be kind of my office yet.
159,ep141,We'll go down to the basement.
160,ep141,-I think we'll find a spot.
161,ep141,-Okay. nice.
162,ep141,It's really big down here.
163,ep141,"So, I know the eye roll is coming, but the acoustics in here with this ceiling..."
164,ep141,Okay. not gonna work -for a music studio.
165,ep141,-You're not an actual musician.
166,ep141,Could you work out here?
167,ep141,Could you work here?
168,ep141,Workout... would definitely work for a workout.
169,ep141,"I mean, look at the ceiling, you know, you said this is a finished basement."
170,ep141,I almost feel like it's just half finished.
171,ep141,There's lots of options down here.
172,ep141,Don't eliminate the opportunities so quickly.
173,ep141,I know it's hard.
174,ep141,This is the first time you guys are buying a house and there's a lot of things that we have to balance.
175,ep141,"So, we're going to have to do that throughout this process."
176,ep141,There's another full bath here.
177,ep141,"You can literally work out, then shower, then go to your office right here."
178,ep141,You'd never have to see each other.
179,ep141,That sounds great right about now.
180,ep141,"After this showing, maybe that's what we need."
181,ep141,"Yes. I need to open my mind a little bit, but I'm also wondering if you're thinking about the price tag and too willing to compromise some of the things that we really need."
182,ep141,"I mean, we're still-- We're significantly below what we want to spend."
183,ep141,But the space is significantly below what we need.
184,ep141,"Like, where do the mothers-in-laws stay when they come?"
185,ep141,"We could transition my office into a guest room, if we need it."
186,ep141,"It's not ideal, but we could make it work."
187,ep141,"I know it's not all about me, but this house doesn't really have any of me in it."
188,ep141,I really feel like I'm giving up a lot.
189,ep141,"So, Lindsay's lined up a bigger place with the style Luke wants, but Rachel, isn't feeling it."
190,ep141,"Oh, my..."
191,ep141,"Lindsay, this is what I'm talking about."
192,ep141,"Like it's from the future, like, this is great."
193,ep141,-It's not my future.
194,ep141,-[Lindsay chuckles]
195,ep141,I checked out the listing and it's like nothing else we've seen so far.
196,ep141,Yeah. a reason why we haven't seen it yet.
197,ep141,Luke and Rachel are butting heads on their first home in Cleveland.
198,ep141,"They've seen a cozy charmer she loved, but it had none of the modern flash he wants."
199,ep141,"So, their agent Lindsay's found a place in their current neighborhood with a style Luke's looking for."
200,ep141,"Three beds, three baths, 549.9."
201,ep141,549? neighborhood that you want.
202,ep141,I do love that we can walk here.
203,ep141,I would love if we could stay in the neighborhood.
204,ep141,This is what I'm talking about.
205,ep141,Like it's from the future.
206,ep141,"Like, this is great."
207,ep141,-Not my future.
208,ep141,-[Lindsay chuckles]
209,ep141,"What is it, a shipping container?"
210,ep141,This is a corrugated metal box.
211,ep141,There's nothing charming at all about this.
212,ep141,I love it.
213,ep141,"This house is all about Luke, but it's Rachel's favorite location."
214,ep141,"And this property has an amazing kitchen, it's really important to her."
215,ep141,"I don't know if she's as willing to compromise on the look, but I'm going to push the boundary there."
216,ep141,Pretty grand entrance when you look all the way up.
217,ep141,It feels like there's so much space.
218,ep141,It is not cozy whatsoever.
219,ep141,This house is custom built.
220,ep141,"So, it's going to be very specific."
221,ep141,We're going to have to kind of be visionaries.
222,ep141,"So, this is one of the three bedrooms."
223,ep141,It has the natural light.
224,ep141,You could definitely do a workout here.
225,ep141,"And then yeah, I could do the music studio and my office here, and for me that would be really great."
226,ep141,"Oh, you're already claiming it."
227,ep141,Rachel will love the yard.
228,ep141,"All right, this is a nice size yard."
229,ep141,"This is nice, especially for the city."
230,ep141,This is cool.
231,ep141,Love the rod lighting.
232,ep141,"I mean, how high is the ceiling from here?"
233,ep141,"This has gotta be 20, 25 feet?"
234,ep141,"I would say, yeah."
235,ep141,And amazing for entertaining.
236,ep141,I do like the floor.
237,ep141,It brings some warmth.
238,ep141,"Rachel, I was kind of thinking that nook might be cool for an office space."
239,ep141,"Oh, yeah."
240,ep141,But I want a space where I can close the door.
241,ep141,Maybe you can close it off with some drywall?
242,ep141,And you get the whole bottom floor?
243,ep141,"Well, I have..."
244,ep141,I have more needs.
245,ep141,[Lindsay and Rachel laugh]
246,ep141,"I mean, there's a wow factor."
247,ep141,The loft up there looks really great from here.
248,ep141,You can even lead people out here to have a drink.
249,ep141,"Yeah. have a glass of wine out here in the evenings, coffee out here."
250,ep141,There's your neighborhood!
251,ep141,She's right about that.
252,ep141,This is our favorite neighborhood.
253,ep141,I would love to be able to walk to our favorite spots still.
254,ep141,Okay. a plus.
255,ep141,I like it.
256,ep141,Look at that waterfall island.
257,ep141,It's good counter space.
258,ep141,Plenty of room for me to chop and cook and work if I need to.
259,ep141,I can tell what you're thinking.
260,ep141,-What? like this kitchen.
261,ep141,"I did not say that, but..."
262,ep141,I see that smile.
263,ep141,I know.
264,ep141,"I mean, you like it."
265,ep141,"I mean, okay, I love the gas burner, you know that, and the appliances look brand new."
266,ep141,Look at the cool bamboo ceilings.
267,ep141,It does give it some warmth.
268,ep141,We'll walk into the owner's suite first.
269,ep141,These windows from the ground up are great.
270,ep141,Can you even fit a king size bed in here?
271,ep141,We can make it work.
272,ep141,Here's your closet.
273,ep141,I think it's a pretty smart use of the space.
274,ep141,It's big enough.
275,ep141,"So, this is the attached bath."
276,ep141,All right.
277,ep141,"Double sinks, definitely a plus, and the marble's great."
278,ep141,Yeah. like it.
279,ep141,"You're going to love the shower, guys."
280,ep141,"Oh, wow!"
281,ep141,You can see the sky!
282,ep141,That's interesting.
283,ep141,"Yes! are great anyway, but I mean, in the shower, that's really, really unique."
284,ep141,"Oh, wow."
285,ep141,What do we have here?
286,ep141,We're going to check out the last bedroom space.
287,ep141,"Rachel, have at it."
288,ep141,[Lindsay chuckles]
289,ep141,I don't think this is safe for kids or our parents to get up and down.
290,ep141,"Oh, wow."
291,ep141,You can see the shower and the toilet as you go up the steps.
292,ep141,"So, say if you had guests up there, how awkward would that be?"
293,ep141,"How could we make this a family house, guys?"
294,ep141,You could take the bottom floor for your space and the nursery.
295,ep141,And then I could put all the band stuff up here.
296,ep141,"You could totally put up a wall here, instead of just an open concept feel."
297,ep141,"Okay. mean, we just have, we have to get as creative as they did when they built the house."
298,ep141,"I like your suggestion of maybe dividing it, but why are we making adjustments at 549?"
299,ep141,There's no reason to say that it wouldn't necessarily work.
300,ep141,I think Rachel and Luke will love this house.
301,ep141,"They can be in the property for a few years, build that family and then move on."
302,ep141,"I mean, the style is really great."
303,ep141,I love the design.
304,ep141,"You know I love the neighborhood, but at 549 and with the layout, that is the only thing I like about this."
305,ep141,"There is no warmth, no coziness in here."
306,ep141,"With both of them digging in, Lindsay's hoping the next place will bring them together."
307,ep141,"But with these two, that may not be possible."
308,ep141,I like the industrial look here.
309,ep141,It's a weird mixture of Colonial with modern.
310,ep141,The metal's kind of throwing me off.
311,ep141,"I'm kind of excited to see, like right when we pull up, if it meets the expectations I have."
312,ep141,Want to be the most standout person on the street?
313,ep141,"No, not necessarily."
314,ep141,I just want it to be one of the unique houses on the street.
315,ep141,Luke is obsessed with style.
316,ep141,"Rachel is fixated on price, and neither one is willing to budge on their Cleveland house search."
317,ep141,"So, their agent Lindsay has found a place ten minutes from their current neighborhood she hopes can get them moving in the same direction."
318,ep141,What do you think of the neighborhood?
319,ep141,I'm thinking that for this price it's way too far from where we want to be.
320,ep141,"I mean, it's a little far from the park, but I mean, 550 is..."
321,ep141,I'm comfortable with that.
322,ep141,"I mean, I'm comfortable with going over."
323,ep141,So... know.
324,ep141,I've heard you say that.
325,ep141,I think this house is a perfect blend between contemporary and more classic.
326,ep141,"It's not exactly where they want to be, but I think this could be a great family home for them."
327,ep141,"So, I'm excited to show you this one, it just hit the market."
328,ep141,It's pretty unique.
329,ep141,"It's a weird mixture of Colonial with modern, the metal's kind of throwing me off."
330,ep141,I think it's actually going to be a really good hybrid for both of you.
331,ep141,I like the industrial look here.
332,ep141,It's sleek.
333,ep141,Yeah. got the modern flare.
334,ep141,Let's take our coats off.
335,ep141,Love these windows.
336,ep141,"Yeah, the natural light."
337,ep141,"So, a little small down here."
338,ep141,"Without anything in here, it's really hard to picture how we would set it up."
339,ep141,It looks like you could set up your living space with like your TV on that wall.
340,ep141,And then this is a really large dining space.
341,ep141,I really liked this floor.
342,ep141,It brings a lot of warmth to this space.
343,ep141,But it's maybe a darker tone than I would normally like.
344,ep141,That's a nice in between.
345,ep141,That's what this is.
346,ep141,It's the in-between house.
347,ep141,Is this house a compromised house?
348,ep141,Probably. want it to be unique.
349,ep141,"I want it to be modern, but I'm not sure that that vibe really carries through."
350,ep141,Wow. love this.
351,ep141,Two ovens?
352,ep141,All these appliances are newer because the home is only two years old.
353,ep141,I could definitely work and cook in here.
354,ep141,I love it.
355,ep141,I like the subway tile in the back.
356,ep141,This little window is kind of funky.
357,ep141,It's very neat.
358,ep141,Yeah. garage is back here.
359,ep141,The backyard's not huge.
360,ep141,I guess that's what we get for the city.
361,ep141,There's two doors here.
362,ep141,"This door goes to the garage, actually."
363,ep141,Very nice.
364,ep141,"Okay, cool."
365,ep141,"Well, let's head upstairs."
366,ep141,Up here is an additional living space.
367,ep141,Wow. pretty.
368,ep141,Yeah. is really nice.
369,ep141,We do have an attached bathroom as well.
370,ep141,"Oh, wow."
371,ep141,"So, what would we use this for?"
372,ep141,-It shouldn't just be my room.
373,ep141,"-No, it's not going to be."
374,ep141,"But I think you'd be happy, too, we could put a squat rack here."
375,ep141,I could see some guitars on the wall.
376,ep141,I can see office space here.
377,ep141,Would I get to use any of this space?
378,ep141,Definitely. room for a treadmill.
379,ep141,I would really like treadmill.
380,ep141,"Frankly, there's still probably plenty of room."
381,ep141,550 almost seems like pretty good value for something like this.
382,ep141,"I think that's a bit of a stretch, but..."
383,ep141,This is awesome.
384,ep141,I really like what could be possible here.
385,ep141,There's a finished bathroom and a shower down here.
386,ep141,The mother-in-law or whoever can have their own space.
387,ep141,"So, this bedroom is pretty nice."
388,ep141,I could see myself working in here.
389,ep141,Definitely a cozy space.
390,ep141,This bedroom is a little smaller.
391,ep141,"For a nursery, maybe?"
392,ep141,Yeah. nursery.
393,ep141,I don't know what else you can really do with it.
394,ep141,It's tiny.
395,ep141,"I don't know, the vibe of upstairs..."
396,ep141,It's cozy.
397,ep141,"Yeah, it is cozy."
398,ep141,You're right.
399,ep141,This is pretty decent size for a second bathroom up here.
400,ep141,"So, let's see what the owner's suite looks like."
401,ep141,Here's your natural light!
402,ep141,Yeah. love that.
403,ep141,You think our future king bed could fit here?
404,ep141,A king would definitely fit.
405,ep141,There's a nice walk-in closet.
406,ep141,"Oh, wow."
407,ep141,Yeah. think it's probably enough space for both of our clothes.
408,ep141,And double vanity.
409,ep141,Love the double vanity.
410,ep141,"Here's some modern flair for you, Luke."
411,ep141,I do like the showers.
412,ep141,This is pretty.
413,ep141,You're not gonna have a whole lot of time on this one.
414,ep141,"In this market, I'm telling ya."
415,ep141,-I'll talk to you guys soon.
416,ep141,"-Thanks, Lindsay."
417,ep141,"-Thanks, Lindsay."
418,ep141,-Take care.
419,ep141,"You know, the upstairs wasn't my favorite, but that space on the back is really something."
420,ep141,Yeah. got the finished basement.
421,ep141,"I mean your office, the nursery."
422,ep141,"It seems a little more than I want to spend, especially for this location."
423,ep141,"I need something a little bit sleeker, but this was a compromise house."
424,ep141,"So far, compromising has not been the easiest."
425,ep141,No. don't know how we're supposed to make a decision on this.
426,ep141,I think we gotta made a decision pretty quickly.
427,ep141,"Honestly, I'm a little overwhelmed."
428,ep141,"Rachel and Luke can't agree on a home in Cleveland, but they've seen a number of places and it's time to make a decision."
429,ep141,I really liked the Colonial.
430,ep141,"It felt really homey, really cozy, and that kitchen was amazing."
431,ep141,But I really want modern.
432,ep141,"And it was cozy, though, because it was small."
433,ep141,But it was only 425.
434,ep141,We don't have guests that often.
435,ep141,"I would have to sacrifice some of my office space for that, but we could still have room for both offices and a nursery."
436,ep141,But the basement's barely finished.
437,ep141,But it is finished.
438,ep141,"I mean, there was no natural light then we're also still not getting the location."
439,ep141,"So, here we were compromising space."
440,ep141,We're compromising location.
441,ep141,"If we spend a little bit more, that shipping container, you call it, is right by the lake."
442,ep141,It's right by the park.
443,ep141,"It's an opportunity to live in a really flashy, amazing looking space."
444,ep141,You can't be so focused on style.
445,ep141,"At 549, we're going to end up spending way over what we want to."
446,ep141,"I could put the music studio, my office space and the workout space."
447,ep141,And when you come up the stairs on that one and you just get that wow factor.
448,ep141,That space was completely open.
449,ep141,I don't want to use that as an office.
450,ep141,"Great kitchen, you said so yourself."
451,ep141,"I have to admit, I love the kitchen in there, but that a loft space was completely open."
452,ep141,We can't use that as a nursery.
453,ep141,Are we supposed to go up and down the steps with a baby?
454,ep141,And then on the way you see that shower?
455,ep141,It's not functional!
456,ep141,Then we'd have to give up this neighborhood.
457,ep141,What about the contemporary modern?
458,ep141,"It's not as flashy a house, but the space above the garage is really ideal for the music, a workout space, my office."
459,ep141,"But at 550, it's still more than I want to spend."
460,ep141,And the upstairs is a little cramped.
461,ep141,"I know the bedrooms are small upstairs, but I could keep an office, and the smaller one could be used as a nursery."
462,ep141,And the finished basement.
463,ep141,"Put the guest bed down there, and I mean the kitchen was perfect."
464,ep141,Double ovens?
465,ep141,"I mean, that's a dream for baking and cooking."
466,ep141,But there aren't many restaurants around there.
467,ep141,We aren't near the park.
468,ep141,I agree with you there.
469,ep141,[doorbell rings]
470,ep141,"It's all right, we only have to do this about 300 more times the next day or two."
471,ep141,We did buy the modern contemporary.
472,ep141,"Having a finished basement, the studio space, plus three bedrooms, it just fit everything we needed."
473,ep141,And then the movers will be here around ten.
474,ep141,"The listing price was 550, we paid 550."
475,ep141,"To get all that functional space, I'm okay with it 'cause I'm so happy with our home."
476,ep141,"We're a little farther away from the park than we'd like, but we've met our neighbors."
477,ep141,It does seem like a close-knit street.
478,ep141,"So, that makes up for it quite a bit."
479,ep141,I want to be able to cook this weekend.
480,ep141,"I mean, the kitchen is amazing."
481,ep141,"We got the double ovens, there's tones of cabinet space for my appliances."
482,ep141,No more having to shove them in the closet.
483,ep141,I might need a step stool though to get up here.
484,ep141,We have a huge finished basement.
485,ep141,And having my own office upstairs is going to be a perfect space.
486,ep141,This thing is pretty big and it looks small in this room.
487,ep141,"We're gonna get a treadmill in there along with the weights, so we'll both be able to use it."
488,ep141,-It really does...
489,ep141,Yeah. perfect.
490,ep141,Did you got the cork stuck?
491,ep141,This is why I'm not doing any projects around the house.
492,ep141,I think the style of home is the best of both worlds.
493,ep141,It's got the wood flooring that feels really cozy.
494,ep141,But it does have a lot of style.
495,ep141,"When people come in and hang out in the first floor, I think they're going to be impressed."
496,ep141,"So, we're drinking boxed wine form here on out?"
497,ep141,"No, no, no."
498,ep141,We're good.
499,ep141,"We're both type A personality people, but I think we came to a good compromise."
500,ep141,We're looking forward to having kids here.
501,ep141,And we are ready to move in and get settled.
1,ep142,"Oh, wow!"
2,ep142,This is pretty.
3,ep142,"Soon to be empty nester, Minhnuyet, is looking for a home in the heart of Atlanta to get her social life back on track."
4,ep142,You wanted walkability.
5,ep142,You wanted close to the BeltLine.
6,ep142,You are right next to it.
7,ep142,I'm looking forward to getting to meet more people.
8,ep142,Dating more.
9,ep142,But finding a home in a trendy spot for the right price that also has the look this designer wants is putting her friend and agent to the test.
10,ep142,"No shower, no tub."
11,ep142,-With this angle...
12,ep142,-Yeah. eats up some space.
13,ep142,"One thing I don't love is how tight this is, and unless I kinda rip this all out and..."
14,ep142,"I mean, there's really no way to kind of-- You always try to rip something out."
15,ep142,[opening theme music playing]
16,ep142,That's a good boy.
17,ep142,Uh-uh. come on.
18,ep142,This way.
19,ep142,I am an interior designer.
20,ep142,I'm divorced.
21,ep142,"I have two boys, 16 and 19."
22,ep142,Go get it.
23,ep142,I have a new puppy and his name is Ollie.
24,ep142,He's a border collie and they are high energy dogs.
25,ep142,Mmm. it delicious?
26,ep142,Mmm-hmm. currently live in a loft in Castleberry Hill.
27,ep142,It's a neighborhood in downtown Atlanta.
28,ep142,It's not the most ideal area for walkability.
29,ep142,"There's a few restaurants in the area, but there's not a ton."
30,ep142,There is no outdoor area for my dog.
31,ep142,"So there's no park nearby, there's no back area."
32,ep142,and I'm about to be an empty nester.
33,ep142,So I feel like this is the next chapter of my life.
34,ep142,I've been devoting a lot of my time to my children and I'm really looking forward to focusing on myself.
35,ep142,-Hey! she is.
36,ep142,-You're just gonna leave?
37,ep142,"You're not gonna say, ""Hi""?"
38,ep142,There she is.
39,ep142,Hi! enlisted Christian because she knows the city like the back of her hand.
40,ep142,She also knows what I like and she knows me well.
41,ep142,We met at a cigar lounge grand opening.
42,ep142,I was on the board of directors and we just hit it off.
43,ep142,Did you find me a place?
44,ep142,-[both laugh]
45,ep142,But I'm looking.
46,ep142,"She's just very direct and she's also very passionate, and I just love her passion."
47,ep142,Thank you.
48,ep142,"Oh, my gosh, it's so pretty."
49,ep142,Even your tray is pretty.
50,ep142,-Are we moving?
51,ep142,-[both laugh]
52,ep142,-This is a heavy table.
53,ep142,"Originally, I was born in Vietnam and we moved when I was two."
54,ep142,My dad was in the army and we did not have a lot growing up.
55,ep142,We would go find things at yard sales.
56,ep142,I would repurpose some.
57,ep142,"Having that background, I love nice things."
58,ep142,"I've worked really, really hard in my life to get to where I am now."
59,ep142,I want you to look at everything.
60,ep142,-I want you to see everything...
61,ep142,"-Okay. know with your eye, you'll really be able to tell me, ""Yes, no."""
62,ep142,I know she loves lofts.
63,ep142,I know she loves just the character and the authenticity.
64,ep142,"However, that is definitely difficult because where she lives now is the home of where authentic lofts in Atlanta are."
65,ep142,"So, I'm looking for single family."
66,ep142,I'm looking for townhomes.
67,ep142,"We're looking for appreciation, equity return on investment 'cause I want her to just have a fresh start."
68,ep142,I know you wanna be in this city.
69,ep142,"and definitely, like, some type of walkability."
70,ep142,Yes. is looking for something close to the BeltLine or in Buckhead.
71,ep142,"I'm looking forward to going to different restaurants and walking to coffee shops, walking the dog, getting to meet more people, dating more, and just exploring the city as a single woman."
72,ep142,"So, ideally, we find something that is closer to four."
73,ep142,"-Yeah. I can, you know, have a little bit extra money."
74,ep142,"to, to renovate."
75,ep142,I love doing renovations.
76,ep142,I really love transforming a space.
77,ep142,"You know, much like I did here."
78,ep142,"-You know, so..."
79,ep142,-Yeah. saw the pictures.
80,ep142,"-Yeah, oh, definitely."
81,ep142,"Yeah. like, this place was a disaster."
82,ep142,Had not been touched since the 80s.
83,ep142,So work your magic.
84,ep142,"Okay. find you a house, Ollie."
85,ep142,"First up, a new built townhome with a patio for Ollie and a great location."
86,ep142,The BeltLine is right there.
87,ep142,That's amazing!
88,ep142,Love how you can see all the restaurants and everything from here.
89,ep142,The fact that this is near the BeltLine is a huge plus.
90,ep142,"Oh, wow."
91,ep142,This is cute!
92,ep142,"This is the model and we are in a corner unit, so that's definitely a premium."
93,ep142,Do you know if there are other corner units available still?
94,ep142,"I will have to check because literally inventory just keeps changing Okay, okay."
95,ep142,I brought Minhnuyet to a townhall because I want her to see something different.
96,ep142,I want her to really recognize all of the options that she has in the market.
97,ep142,And it's just an awesome location as well.
98,ep142,"So, for what you get for the value, I can definitely see it appreciating."
99,ep142,This is amazing!
100,ep142,And it's move-in ready.
101,ep142,-I see that.
102,ep142,-[both laugh]
103,ep142,-So I understand that you like to put your stamp on things.
104,ep142,"-Yeah. you know, have an open mind and let's take a look."
105,ep142,I think it's a great space and a good option.
106,ep142,"I mean, I like how they have it set up."
107,ep142,My sectional will not fit.
108,ep142,Your sectional will not fit in here.
109,ep142,-There's no way.
110,ep142,"-Your sectional's the size of a small country, so it will not fit."
111,ep142,"-Yeah, that's true, that's true."
112,ep142,"So it's a small kitchen, but one thing I don't love is how tight this is -'cause once you put the bar stools here..."
113,ep142,"-Yeah. seating, I mean, the walkway is gonna get really tight."
114,ep142,And unless I kinda rip this all out and...
115,ep142,"I mean, there's really no way I can move it-- You always try to rip something out."
116,ep142,Not trying to rip something out.
117,ep142,"I'm just saying that it's like, I wish it was another foot."
118,ep142,-You know?
119,ep142,-I got you.
120,ep142,Another foot would probably make a big difference.
121,ep142,That's a super deep sink.
122,ep142,I love that.
123,ep142,I like the single bowl.
124,ep142,"Appliances are not super high end, but they're nice."
125,ep142,"And then, you do have your dining area over here."
126,ep142,"So the great thing is, of course, you have a seating area for four."
127,ep142,"Of course, you would probably figure this is something that maybe would fit six."
128,ep142,"-Yeah, that's-- -'Cause you maximize space."
129,ep142,"Yeah, that's a little tight."
130,ep142,It looks more like a breakfast area -than an actual dining area.
131,ep142,"-Okay. the patio, which is nice."
132,ep142,I really wanted an outdoor space.
133,ep142,"You know, for me to spend some time out there and have Ollie kinda running."
134,ep142,I like that.
135,ep142,Take a look at your owner's suite right in there.
136,ep142,Okay. this is probably a king bed.
137,ep142,It's a little tight.
138,ep142,"This is a nice, big bathroom."
139,ep142,I really love the cement tile that they picked.
140,ep142,-That's really pretty.
141,ep142,"-Yeah. not too feminine, it's not masculine."
142,ep142,"So, I like that."
143,ep142,I probably would change out all the plumbing fixtures and the hardware.
144,ep142,Maybe the mirrors and just give it some more personality.
145,ep142,-Maybe put a chandelier in here.
146,ep142,What do you think about the closet size?
147,ep142,"I mean, it's a little small."
148,ep142,What I would probably have to do like what I do now is swap my summer and my winter clothes.
149,ep142,Yeah. I guess the good thing is I get to try on my clothes and if I gain some weight-- Throw it out there.
150,ep142,-Which we have to look at the second bedroom.
151,ep142,-Okay. the nice thing is you have a separation with your guests.
152,ep142,"So even when your sons come, they're downstairs."
153,ep142,So I don't have to see their mess?
154,ep142,No. then look!
155,ep142,"-Oh, so cute!"
156,ep142,I love that.
157,ep142,"Ollie could have his little, I can fit, like, a little doggy door."
158,ep142,"-I know, right?"
159,ep142,-You could have a little dog.
160,ep142,And you still have a whole another little inset for storage.
161,ep142,"Yeah, that's..."
162,ep142,I love that.
163,ep142,I love how they had that set up.
164,ep142,-And then-- -So this is second bedroom?
165,ep142,It's your second bedroom.
166,ep142,"They're using it, since this is the model, as an office."
167,ep142,"It's a little small, but I guess my kids don't need a ton of space."
168,ep142,-Since they're not really with me full time.
169,ep142,-Yes. do have their own bathroom -which is nice.
170,ep142,Yeah. bathroom.
171,ep142,Yeah. really love that tile.
172,ep142,-Yes. a little honey comb tile.
173,ep142,"-Again, probably change out a few things..."
174,ep142,"-Yeah. give it some more per, you know..."
175,ep142,"-Yeah, your personality in there."
176,ep142,-Personality. definitely think Minhnuyet would make changes.
177,ep142,"That's, that's just..."
178,ep142,That's Minhnuyet.
179,ep142,"So it's not an option for her to go into a space and not see a possibility even though something like this is completely turnkey, move-in ready."
180,ep142,She's still gonna find a way to personalize it to herself.
181,ep142,So the HOA ranges depending between $161 to $181 per month.
182,ep142,"Okay, that's low."
183,ep142,What about the amenities?
184,ep142,"Is there a pool or fitness center, like a little enclosed dog area?"
185,ep142,Your home is your amenity and the BeltLine.
186,ep142,"-Okay. really not a dog park just because the BeltLine is right there, and of course, to keep HOAs low, -that's it."
187,ep142,-Mmm-hmm. it just takes care of your exterior maintenance.
188,ep142,"Oh, okay, so there's no plans of them putting in a pool or putting in a fitness center?"
189,ep142,"-Not at this time, no."
190,ep142,-Okay. do like all the little shops and restaurants right here.
191,ep142,I could see myself living here.
192,ep142,I love having an outdoor patio 'cause I don't currently have one.
193,ep142,"The owner's suite is a little small, but the bathroom is amazing."
194,ep142,The finishes are nicely done.
195,ep142,I think there is still room for me to add my own special touch to it.
196,ep142,And we're near the BeltLine.
197,ep142,This is a hot community.
198,ep142,"Everybody wants walkable, everyone wants BeltLine."
199,ep142,So these are going quickly and I definitely expect that they will probably sell out pretty soon.
200,ep142,"But since Minhnuyet isn't quite ready to commit, her agent found her an ideal loft-style place in a prime walkable location, except there's a major downside."
201,ep142,I think that this is smaller than what I currently have.
202,ep142,-Really excited for you to see this place.
203,ep142,-Yeah? it is a loft.
204,ep142,"Since Minhnuyet's current loft isn't in a walkable area and she's ready to socialize after her divorce, she's been hunting for a new home with the help of her close friend and agent."
205,ep142,She loves lofts.
206,ep142,"It's really kind of like loft 2.0,"
207,ep142,"great location, everything she wanted to be around but still have that character that she's looking for with the loft."
208,ep142,The outside of the building's pretty.
209,ep142,Yeah. have amazing walkability to everything that you need.
210,ep142,We are in the heart of Buckhead.
211,ep142,"Minhnuyet wanted something walkable, something where she could go to award-winning restaurants, and she doesn't have that where she's currently at."
212,ep142,So I am making sure to bring what is top in Atlanta to her with this location.
213,ep142,"Oh, wow!"
214,ep142,This is pretty.
215,ep142,"-Right? I'm a little bit of a fan girl on this one because it's, like the kitchen's beautiful."
216,ep142,Kitchen is really cute.
217,ep142,-Let's make ourselves comfortable.
218,ep142,-Okay. be here for a while?
219,ep142,-We're gonna be here for a while.
220,ep142,'Cause I know how you are.
221,ep142,I love the colors.
222,ep142,I love the marble.
223,ep142,"I mean, this is really pretty."
224,ep142,I think it's kind of small.
225,ep142,That's the only thing.
226,ep142,"I mean, I think that this is smaller than what I currently have."
227,ep142,"-I mean, don't you think?"
228,ep142,-It is.
229,ep142,And I wanted to show it just because of the location.
230,ep142,Minhnuyet's ready to get back out there.
231,ep142,"She is single and ready to mingle, and I want her to have a place that reflects that."
232,ep142,"So, we'll see what she thinks."
233,ep142,And you do have an HOA of $600 a month.
234,ep142,Wow! a lot.
235,ep142,You do have a workout facility.
236,ep142,You have a 24-hour concierge.
237,ep142,Is there a pool?
238,ep142,There is a pool too.
239,ep142,-Yes. it has a dog park.
240,ep142,"So for Ollie, of course, you could take him out to the dog park."
241,ep142,"Oh, that's nice."
242,ep142,This is...
243,ep142,"Oh, my God!"
244,ep142,I love a fireplace.
245,ep142,Does it work?
246,ep142,It does.
247,ep142,-Okay. only thing is that...
248,ep142,-with this angle...
249,ep142,-Yeah. eats up some space.
250,ep142,I don't really know if my sectional's gonna fit in here.
251,ep142,Maybe we could chop your sofa up somehow.
252,ep142,[both laugh]
253,ep142,"Sure, let's just chop up expensive sofas."
254,ep142,This is your owner's suite.
255,ep142,"It's just, you know, I love a loft, but it's..."
256,ep142,-It's just like right...
257,ep142,-I know.
258,ep142,in the living room.
259,ep142,It's like I'm gonna be in bed and my kids are gonna be sitting here.
260,ep142,That's just kind of weird.
261,ep142,"-Well, you do have an amazing bathroom."
262,ep142,-Okay. bathroom is me.
263,ep142,-Yes. I...
264,ep142,I would have done this.
265,ep142,I love this.
266,ep142,"-Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!"
267,ep142,-Yes. then behind you is your closet.
268,ep142,That's not a closet.
269,ep142,-This is an abbreviated closet.
270,ep142,"-Oh, my God!"
271,ep142,"-So, this is your-- -Oh, here's the closet."
272,ep142,"-That is currently its function, however..."
273,ep142,-Okay. the second bedroom.
274,ep142,Um... guess I might have to take out...
275,ep142,...some this closet.
276,ep142,"I mean, this is amazing to have this much closet space that I don't currently have all that tall closet space."
277,ep142,Can I just get rid of my children?
278,ep142,[both laugh]
279,ep142,"Well, I just want you to remember that this is about you."
280,ep142,Yeah. kids are leaving.
281,ep142,I've been focusing primarily on them and now I wanna focus on myself and have something that's really for me.
282,ep142,And then behind you is this second bath.
283,ep142,-And-- -Where's the shower?
284,ep142,Your laundry is here...
285,ep142,Actually... is...
286,ep142,No shower.
287,ep142,"-No shower, no tub."
288,ep142,-I appreciate the way you're looking at me right now.
289,ep142,-No. are you thinking?
290,ep142,"My thought was, shower-wise, you could take out that closet."
291,ep142,There's definitely plumbing because you have that right there.
292,ep142,-Yeah. we could look at that.
293,ep142,Okay. this is what I wanted you to see and I was excited about -because you do not get this.
294,ep142,"-Oh, wow!"
295,ep142,This is awesome!
296,ep142,This is like having a whole other living area.
297,ep142,I think Ollie would love the space.
298,ep142,We can throw a ball out here.
299,ep142,He can run.
300,ep142,Wear out some energy.
301,ep142,So... would be excited.
302,ep142,This is kind of a game changer.
303,ep142,"If it didn't have this, I would..."
304,ep142,"Uh, I don't know."
305,ep142,I still gotta think about it.
306,ep142,"But before she decides, they're heading to one more option."
307,ep142,A single family home with great fixer potential.
308,ep142,"It's still in Buckhead, just a little farther out."
309,ep142,Can you walk to anything from the house?
310,ep142,You will not be able to walk.
311,ep142,"Keep an open mind, you have to keep an open mind."
312,ep142,[theme music playing]
313,ep142,There is a pocket listing I just heard about.
314,ep142,-Really? is a single family.
315,ep142,Yes. you have a second?
316,ep142,Can I come by and pick you up so we can go?
317,ep142,"Okay, perfect."
318,ep142,"As an interior designer with high-end taste, Minhnuyet's looking for a home that she can put her stamp on."
319,ep142,"But she also wants to be in the heart of the action, so she can pump up her social life."
320,ep142,"And that's proving a challenge for her friend and agent, Christian."
321,ep142,"I don't see any, like, restaurants or anything around here."
322,ep142,Can you walk to anything from the house?
323,ep142,You will not be able to walk.
324,ep142,Can't walk at all?
325,ep142,-You won't...
326,ep142,You'll just be able to walk.
327,ep142,You won't be able to walk to restaurants.
328,ep142,[both laugh]
329,ep142,"Keep an open mind, you have to keep an open mind."
330,ep142,"So this home is three bedrooms, two baths -$445,000."
331,ep142,-Okay. eyes will see it and love it and it gives us the opportunity to go in before anyone else can.
332,ep142,"Oh, sweet!"
333,ep142,My vision is for you is getting top dollar after you renovate because you are in a great school district.
334,ep142,You're super close to West Midtown.
335,ep142,And you're in Buckhead.
336,ep142,"If you are in Buckhead, it's a premier neighborhood, kind of on the edge, so you're also close to West Midtown which has a lot of shops, restaurants."
337,ep142,"So with Minhnuyet really looking for the next stage of her life, I think that's gonna be huge for her."
338,ep142,What do you think so far?
339,ep142,I think it looks cute.
340,ep142,I like the turquoise front door.
341,ep142,-Very welcoming.
342,ep142,-Very cheerful.
343,ep142,Wow! this is cozy.
344,ep142,I want you to see the vision.
345,ep142,I like the higher ceilings.
346,ep142,"It's a cute house, for sure."
347,ep142,The dining area...
348,ep142,It's so weird that they have these doors and that door there.
349,ep142,"So I probably would wanna take this partial partition out take that wall, or that door out, and then that way, the dining area becomes bigger."
350,ep142,So right here is your first bedroom -and you have-- -This is really small.
351,ep142,I think it really could just be an office.
352,ep142,This is your owner's suite.
353,ep142,This is very cozy.
354,ep142,"But, you know, since I really don't need an office, I could probably take the space from that room and take out these walls and bump -the bathroom..."
355,ep142,"-Oh, yeah."
356,ep142,...and closet into there.
357,ep142,I think it would make more sense to have a bigger bedroom and bathroom.
358,ep142,"See, I knew you'd come in -and you'd get some ideas."
359,ep142,-Yeah. you have this bedroom which I love.
360,ep142,-It's a larger bedroom.
361,ep142,"-Yeah, this one's good."
362,ep142,-What year was this house built?
363,ep142,-1955. looks like a 1950s ranch.
364,ep142,So you do have lots of space for King Ollie.
365,ep142,-Aw! at this yard.
366,ep142,"Yeah, so it's all fenced in?"
367,ep142,It's all fenced in.
368,ep142,Having the backyard probably is a huge plus.
369,ep142,He would love for me to just open the door.
370,ep142,"He could just go and explore, go, like, chase squirrels and birds and all that, he would enjoy it."
371,ep142,"And I was just thinking if you take the home out a little bit more, possibly it'll give you a bigger footprint."
372,ep142,"Yeah, that's true."
373,ep142,Let's look at the kitchen.
374,ep142,"It's not open, so..."
375,ep142,"I definitely would take these two walls out, that way the living space is much bigger, and if we bumped out, then at least we would have a decent sized living room."
376,ep142,I could put the kitchen more towards this area.
377,ep142,"So, I think it could be workable."
378,ep142,It's not exactly what I was thinking I was gonna buy.
379,ep142,I wanted something either on the BeltLine or in a more vibrant community.
380,ep142,"This was completely a wildcard I wanted to throw in here, because I just know that with your talent and with the fact that where this location is, that this could be a great moneymaker for you."
381,ep142,"Yeah, yeah."
382,ep142,"As we're walking through and my ideas are kind of playing in my mind, you know, I love a good renovation."
383,ep142,"In my soul, I love to do renovations, it's really exciting, but at the same aspect, I'm busy with work and I wanna spend as much time with my youngest child before he goes away to college."
384,ep142,And a renovation of this size would take a lot of time.
385,ep142,"So, it's..."
386,ep142,I'm kind of...
387,ep142,I'm torn on that decision.
388,ep142,Look at those.
389,ep142,Look at the sheers.
390,ep142,Love it.
391,ep142,-Isn't it gorgeous?
392,ep142,"-Yeah. it's, like, I see it, and then I wanna see you, like, put it all together."
393,ep142,"Interior designer Minhnuyet is ready for the next chapter in her life, which means moving out of her current loft."
394,ep142,She just has to figure out how different she wants her new place to be.
395,ep142,We have the beautiful townhome.
396,ep142,It's a great location.
397,ep142,Those little shops and restaurants that are right next to it are super cute.
398,ep142,"I can take Ollie on long walks on the BeltLine, that would be super fun."
399,ep142,It's nicely done.
400,ep142,It's finished well.
401,ep142,"I would probably come in and change out some light textures, put some other fixtures."
402,ep142,"The one thing, too, the townhome has a really low HOA."
403,ep142,It's new construction which was not my ideal.
404,ep142,I probably can't negotiate the price.
405,ep142,"No. then, of course the loft..."
406,ep142,It's very walkable.
407,ep142,-Yeah. love that.
408,ep142,"That patio is massive, -I mean, which is great."
409,ep142,"-Yeah. would love that, for sure."
410,ep142,It's small though.
411,ep142,The kitchen is super tiny.
412,ep142,I would probably wanna put money into that.
413,ep142,The second bedroom is really just a huge closet.
414,ep142,You have a higher HOA there.
415,ep142,But you do have amenities to go with it.
416,ep142,"So then, we, of course have what I think is the moneymaker."
417,ep142,-Single family.
418,ep142,-Yeah. really appealing.
419,ep142,"I could come in, renovate that little house."
420,ep142,"I mean, you know I like to do renovations."
421,ep142,The backyard is amazing.
422,ep142,I don't love the fact that it's not walkable to anything.
423,ep142,"It has more of a suburban feel, which is probably not conducive to me really meeting other single people."
424,ep142,It's hard.
425,ep142,I'm torn on each one.
426,ep142,[upbeat music playing]
427,ep142,[doorbell chiming]
428,ep142,"I finally got the renderings done -for the kitchen, -It looks amazing."
429,ep142,"Yeah, I think it looks really good."
430,ep142,I bought the loft!
431,ep142,I chose this place because the patio was amazing.
432,ep142,"Being in a walkable area there's lots of restaurants around, there's bars around."
433,ep142,It's some place that I think will be super fun.
434,ep142,"The second bedroom was challenging because it didn't really have a bed, or an area for a bed."
435,ep142,"And I didn't wanna lose the closet space, so I end up putting in a murphy bed for my kids."
436,ep142,And that has actually turned out really well.
437,ep142,"And then here, you know, of course we have the fridge."
438,ep142,My biggest project is gonna be the kitchen renovation.
439,ep142,I'm going to expand the kitchen and take out the built-in bookcase.
440,ep142,I'm going to design the islands so that it can function as a dining space as well.
441,ep142,"We're gonna do a system of, uh..."
442,ep142,"Of lifts where you can actually lift this up, and you can actually have extra seating."
443,ep142,Ollie likes it.
444,ep142,"He was a little nervous about the elevator, so..."
445,ep142,But he's getting used to it.
446,ep142,"I think he really, really loves the patio."
447,ep142,"We'll leave the door open, he'll just go back and forth and play and bring his toys out there and we can throw the ball."
448,ep142,Get it!
449,ep142,Yay! boy!
450,ep142,Come on!
451,ep142,"When I purchased the first loft, I was not in the best time of my life."
452,ep142,I had just gotten divorced.
453,ep142,"Now, this is so much more joy in my life."
454,ep142,I'm more social in this area.
455,ep142,"That part of my life has exploded, basically."
456,ep142,"So that's really, really, really nice."
457,ep142,Now I get to enjoy.
1,ep143,Whoa. my goodness.
2,ep143,"-Nicole, this is beautiful."
3,ep143,It's like two ceilings.
4,ep143,"After years in the Air Force, LaChelle is hoping to finally plant roots for herself and her son in Virginia."
5,ep143,She's looking for family-friendly amenities for him.
6,ep143,-There's like multiple pools.
7,ep143,-Oh. see a basketball court.
8,ep143,And fancy vibes for herself.
9,ep143,"I like it, actually."
10,ep143,"Right? giving you like a Janet Jackson sexy, -not Cardi B sexy."
11,ep143,-Indeed. between LaChelle's exacting personality...
12,ep143,I don't like this carpet at all.
13,ep143,I would want there to be hardwoods up here.
14,ep143,Okay. nine-year-old Jaxon weighing in as well.
15,ep143,"The one thing about this kitchen is that I wish it had, like, cabinets."
16,ep143,This agent is going to have her hands full.
17,ep143,[theme music playing]
18,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
19,ep143,Are you gonna watch or are you gonna help?
20,ep143,-I'll help.
21,ep143,I'm a single mom.
22,ep143,I have a nine-year-old son named Jaxon.
23,ep143,Why don't you get the spatula out?
24,ep143,Okay. work in IT project management.
25,ep143,I'm very structured.
26,ep143,Hit it hard.
27,ep143,There you go.
28,ep143,"I grew up in a army household, both parents were 20 years army."
29,ep143,"And then on top of that, you know, I was active duty in the Air Force myself."
30,ep143,Okay. got it now.
31,ep143,"We moved here to this area about two years ago from Mobile, Alabama."
32,ep143,I'm living in my mom's house and I'm looking for my next home.
33,ep143,"It would be really, really nice for Jaxon to have some kind of roots."
34,ep143,"We moved every couple of years, and so I'm really looking for a home that we're not really gonna move from."
35,ep143,Over the pot.
36,ep143,There you go.
37,ep143,"I don't need help with everything, Mom."
38,ep143,I would love to stay closer to the Woodbridge area because my office is in DC.
39,ep143,"Oh, my gosh, when did he start cooking?"
40,ep143,"Even though Nicole is my agent, she's been more like a friend than an agent."
41,ep143,Looks like you and your mom have the same taste.
42,ep143,This is what we were talking about.
43,ep143,-Yes. I was telling you that I wanted something that looks like my mom's house because...
44,ep143,"-Right. this, -like, dark mahogany..."
45,ep143,Yes. going on?
46,ep143,"Yes. you walk through the house, I want this dark and sophisticated feel, you know, like Cuban cigar lounge."
47,ep143,"I don't want, like, the white cabinetry..."
48,ep143,-Right. that...
49,ep143,I like white cabinets.
50,ep143,"Like, I like the dark, but it's also, like..."
51,ep143,"-It's, like..."
52,ep143,But you...
53,ep143,...it match the silver.
54,ep143,"Jaxon wants some more open airy feel, opposed to the sultry cigar lounge."
55,ep143,"Well, when Jaxon's paying some mortgage -then we can have..."
56,ep143,Yes. feel for Jaxon.
57,ep143,I'm looking for a house that makes a statement.
58,ep143,"When you pull up, it needs to say something."
59,ep143,"Craftsman. of has a presence, and I feel like I have a presence."
60,ep143,It would be nice if I had a porch.
61,ep143,"-Okay. do like the relaxed feel of a front porch, because it says ""I'm strong, but I like to relax, too""."
62,ep143,"But if I don't have a porch, I really want some outdoor space in the back."
63,ep143,"So... I wanna be able to barbecue and, like, grill and stuff."
64,ep143,-You don't grill.
65,ep143,-Like barbecue though.
66,ep143,-You want me to barbecue?
67,ep143,-Yeah. don't know how to make it.
68,ep143,I mean...
69,ep143,I really would like if we had like a basement area.
70,ep143,"For him, you know what I mean?"
71,ep143,"There is also gonna be a full bar because mommy has to have something in the basement, too."
72,ep143,And you know I hate carpet.
73,ep143,"No, Mom."
74,ep143,"No. like carpet better because, like, you can..."
75,ep143,I like rolling in it because it feels nice.
76,ep143,Then you know how I feel about those older homes?
77,ep143,"Yes, I know all about LaChelle's doll stories."
78,ep143,"I mean I don't know if I would say I believe in ghosts per se, but energies, you can feel, especially if it's older."
79,ep143,"$500,000 max."
80,ep143,"I know, I know."
81,ep143,And honestly...
82,ep143,We all have trips to take.
83,ep143,-I have stuff I wanna go do.
84,ep143,"Absolutely. know, my last one, there was the really expensive HOA."
85,ep143,Yes. really restrictive and I didn't get anything for it.
86,ep143,So if we could find something with no HOA...
87,ep143,-Okay. didn't even let me have like a basketball hoop up.
88,ep143,You didn't have a basketball hoop?
89,ep143,We weren't even allowed to put up a basketball hoop.
90,ep143,"We've got to get you a basketball hoop, -so that's..."
91,ep143,Yeah. be top priority.
92,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
93,ep143,"First up, a home in LaChelle's ideal location of Woodbridge, just 35 minutes from DC."
94,ep143,"The price point is $399,000."
95,ep143,Your... wow.
96,ep143,-Yes. kind of crazy in Woodbridge.
97,ep143,"Exactly. the house is a little bit older, built in 1967."
98,ep143,I know.
99,ep143,"Nicole, so you're telling me I can expect one ghost..."
100,ep143,"-I know, I know."
101,ep143,-...two don't know if there's any ghosts there now.
102,ep143,-I cannot confirm.
103,ep143,-I'm joking.
104,ep143,But it's all the way upgraded...
105,ep143,"-Okay, that's good."
106,ep143,Yes. HOA.
107,ep143,"Oh, no."
108,ep143,I love that.
109,ep143,I know.
110,ep143,-You know I love that.
111,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
112,ep143,"So like I said, it's a little bit older..."
113,ep143,Yeah. has great character.
114,ep143,"Yeah. this house might not be her dream house, but it has a lot of things that she wants."
115,ep143,"LaChelle is big on presence, she wants a strong presence."
116,ep143,"So when I think of LaChelle, I think strong, brick presence."
117,ep143,Brick front I like.
118,ep143,I do like that part.
119,ep143,-Watch your steps here.
120,ep143,Thank you.
121,ep143,You have your front porch here.
122,ep143,Oh. this what we're calling a porch?
123,ep143,"-Hey, it's a porch, right?"
124,ep143,"Yeah. chairs, and it's a porch."
125,ep143,Okay. in.
126,ep143,-Original hardwood floors.
127,ep143,Right. bad.
128,ep143,"Not bad, not bad."
129,ep143,I like that.
130,ep143,"It's kind of tight, kind of small in here, though."
131,ep143,"It is, it is."
132,ep143,But it's upgraded.
133,ep143,"-Jaxon's white cabinet, mom."
134,ep143,Yes. would much rather this be dark and sexy.
135,ep143,"Yes. know, with the barstools."
136,ep143,"I do like the finishes in here, and I like the original hardwoods, gives some good character, I like this window so I'm not mad at that."
137,ep143,All right.
138,ep143,-Let's see here.
139,ep143,What do we have?
140,ep143,Okay. hallway.
141,ep143,"Yes. is small, but it's cute."
142,ep143,"So this would probably be, like, Jaxon's bathroom."
143,ep143,"Well, I'm thinking this might be your main bathroom."
144,ep143,Oh. to know.
145,ep143,Here's an extra bedroom.
146,ep143,Okay. could be an office.
147,ep143,Right. see how the closet looks.
148,ep143,-It doesn't look bad.
149,ep143,"Okay. I felt something when you opened the closet door, and it gives me attic-y spooky-like vibage."
150,ep143,"...a dark, I guess."
151,ep143,A little dark.
152,ep143,A little dark up there?
153,ep143,It was definitely a gust of wind.
154,ep143,Or maybe it's because I opened it fast.
155,ep143,Let's just say that.
156,ep143,Let's call it that.
157,ep143,So I would guess this would be maybe a main bedroom?
158,ep143,It seems like it could probably hold a queen size bed.
159,ep143,But I have a king.
160,ep143,-Oh. two chests.
161,ep143,"Like, I didn't go with the nightstand thing."
162,ep143,That wouldn't all fit in here.
163,ep143,There's another level downstairs.
164,ep143,This is what we consider a split level.
165,ep143,This is pretty steep now.
166,ep143,It is.
167,ep143,But I do like how we come right back -to another bathroom.
168,ep143,Bathroom. it's the same size as the other one.
169,ep143,"Right. two bathrooms, but they're bedrooms are upstairs."
170,ep143,Yes. two bedrooms upstairs and they said there's two down here.
171,ep143,That's a weird living situation.
172,ep143,Looks like you have one living upstairs and one living area down here.
173,ep143,It does.
174,ep143,So maybe Jaxon can have his own little apartment downstairs.
175,ep143,-Okay. since he's nine...
176,ep143,...I love that idea.
177,ep143,"My worry for Jaxon having his bathroom downstairs or living space downstairs is just security, you know?"
178,ep143,"I just feel like he's an only child, we've been together step and step, and I would just like him to be on the same level as me."
179,ep143,"Because she's saving a lot of money on this home, she could build another bathroom."
180,ep143,"In fact, since there's no HOA, she could build out and build a bigger bedroom as well."
181,ep143,-Yeah. you know what?
182,ep143,Okay. you did mention you like a wet bar.
183,ep143,Yeah. I see that.
184,ep143,"I definitely see that, and then my little cart..."
185,ep143,"-Yes. here, and you can also do a lot of entertaining and stuff in this area."
186,ep143,"Oh, this is kind of cute."
187,ep143,-That's kind of cute.
188,ep143,Right. one of the bigger rooms.
189,ep143,So would this be my room?
190,ep143,Maybe this could be yours.
191,ep143,It's a nice covered patio out here where you can do...
192,ep143,It is covered.
193,ep143,That's cool.
194,ep143,I see some stone stuff here.
195,ep143,I do like that.
196,ep143,"But Nicole, it's full of water."
197,ep143,I didn't expect it to be like this.
198,ep143,"Yeah, this is not..."
199,ep143,"No. look at the possibilities, -look how huge this yard..."
200,ep143,"-Nicole, do you know how much it would cost to get this to look like something?"
201,ep143,This would...
202,ep143,"This, I don't like this at all."
203,ep143,"That's why you have Jaxon, hello?"
204,ep143,"-Oh, he's nine."
205,ep143,He can't help.
206,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
207,ep143,I do like the original hardwoods.
208,ep143,-It has been upgraded.
209,ep143,Yes. my vibe on the countertops.
210,ep143,"Great location, you know?"
211,ep143,-It is a great location.
212,ep143,Right. really can't beat that.
213,ep143,But I will have to figure out the bathroom thing.
214,ep143,"You know, if you could show me something that has, like, bigger space..."
215,ep143,"Okay. really, really like seeing that."
216,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
217,ep143,"So this next place has more square footage, but it also has something else."
218,ep143,There is an HOA.
219,ep143,-Nicole... -But...
220,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
221,ep143,That one looks like a craftsman.
222,ep143,-You see the pillars...
223,ep143,-Yes. one?
224,ep143,-That looks good.
225,ep143,"With nine-year-old Jaxon as her wingman today, single mom LaChelle is seeing an option a little farther outside DC."
226,ep143,There's a lot of new construction here.
227,ep143,"There is, there is."
228,ep143,"I promise you, you're gonna love it."
229,ep143,Because this community has so many amazing amenities.
230,ep143,"And there's like, multiple pools."
231,ep143,Ooh. see a basketball court.
232,ep143,And a basketball court.
233,ep143,Basketball court.
234,ep143,"-So the only problem, okay?"
235,ep143,-There is an HOA.
236,ep143,"-Nicole... I'm gonna make it worth it, and guess what?"
237,ep143,What? ghosts.
238,ep143,-This is true.
239,ep143,This is true.
240,ep143,-It's brand new.
241,ep143,Unless they built it on top of a cemetery or something.
242,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
243,ep143,"Okay. first of all, what do you think about this covered patio?"
244,ep143,"It's big enough for the two of us, right?"
245,ep143,-I like the windows.
246,ep143,-Okay. dark color's pretty nice.
247,ep143,I like blue.
248,ep143,-All right.
249,ep143,"-Oh, wow."
250,ep143,Look at these hardwoods.
251,ep143,Yes. at the hardwood floors.
252,ep143,-Isn't it beautiful?
253,ep143,-And this presence.
254,ep143,-I like the simple...
255,ep143,"Nice, high ceilings."
256,ep143,Okay. knows exactly what she wants.
257,ep143,"But sometimes, you have to actually take them out of the bubble so they can actually see that there's something more beautiful, even though it doesn't encompass everything that they think they want."
258,ep143,"Even though it has an HOA, I think it's a place that she would really love."
259,ep143,"-Oh, my God."
260,ep143,"Yes. this, like, not amazing?"
261,ep143,Yeah. wanted that cigar lounge feel.
262,ep143,I did.
263,ep143,And it's...
264,ep143,And I do get that.
265,ep143,...giving that.
266,ep143,"It does look like your mom's house, though, -I will have to say that."
267,ep143,-It looks sexy in here.
268,ep143,"The one thing about this kitchen is that I wish it had, like, cabinets."
269,ep143,"We're still on the white cabinets, huh?"
270,ep143,"No, no, no."
271,ep143,"Look, look."
272,ep143,It even matches with this.
273,ep143,-I gray.
274,ep143,-The backsplash is nice.
275,ep143,"Unless we paint it a different color, I can see the brown working, but it doesn't..."
276,ep143,You can see the brown working?
277,ep143,Jaxon is an old soul.
278,ep143,I never talked...
279,ep143,"Baby talked to him when he was little, and I think that's biting me now."
280,ep143,"But look what else, Jaxon."
281,ep143,"I can be right over there, -that can be mommy's space."
282,ep143,Right. know what I don't see though?
283,ep143,"There's no deck, and no kind of outdoor space."
284,ep143,I know.
285,ep143,I know.
286,ep143,But it's something I can add.
287,ep143,"Right, right."
288,ep143,"No. think about the price point, though."
289,ep143,-The price point is great.
290,ep143,That's true.
291,ep143,"You didn't mention whether you wanted wood on the stairs, so how do you feel about this?"
292,ep143,"I like it, actually."
293,ep143,It's weird how they're different colors right here.
294,ep143,Yeah. do transition in color.
295,ep143,Wow. definitely pays attention to detail.
296,ep143,He does pay attention to detail.
297,ep143,Whoa. my goodness.
298,ep143,"-Nicole, this is beautiful."
299,ep143,"It's, like, two ceilings."
300,ep143,"Yeah. does the double vault, and look, I could see this for sure."
301,ep143,You know what I could also do?
302,ep143,"Wherever there's a light fixture, there can be a chandelier."
303,ep143,"Oh, yeah."
304,ep143,Why would do you need a chandelier...
305,ep143,Yeah. do that.
306,ep143,"-...closet? I don't need a chandelier there, but I'm just saying, if you wanna have, like..."
307,ep143,"-That's extra money, too."
308,ep143,-...some is extra...
309,ep143,What... so you're buying chandeliers now?
310,ep143,"No, I'm just saying."
311,ep143,-Feed any of it.
312,ep143,-No one's gonna see it.
313,ep143,I'm gonna see it.
314,ep143,I want the bling.
315,ep143,"-Personal preference, guys."
316,ep143,"-Okay. you, Nicole."
317,ep143,-This is a gorgeous...
318,ep143,"Oh, my goodness."
319,ep143,"...gorgeous like this a lot, Nicole."
320,ep143,This is beautiful double sinks.
321,ep143,"-Nice, really, really cool."
322,ep143,Sinks. amazing.
323,ep143,"Here's another bedroom, but it has carpet, Jaxon."
324,ep143,"No. the carpet, I don't like the color, it's ugly."
325,ep143,What's the problem with the carpet?
326,ep143,It's dark...
327,ep143,"Too dark, it doesn't match the walls at all."
328,ep143,"This wouldn't be your room, though, because this is really close to the main."
329,ep143,Yeah. don't have to love this one.
330,ep143,Mommy needs space.
331,ep143,"Oh, I like this bathroom."
332,ep143,-This is really nice.
333,ep143,Ooh. so this would be my bathroom I guess.
334,ep143,"And you got double sinks, too."
335,ep143,You got the same floors as I do in the...
336,ep143,"-...in main bathroom, too."
337,ep143,I do.
338,ep143,That's really nice.
339,ep143,"I'm gonna pick this one, I think."
340,ep143,But I still don't like the carpet.
341,ep143,"Okay. have one more level to you, and that is the basement."
342,ep143,Be careful because this basement is unfinished.
343,ep143,"Okay. stated you want a bar, Jaxon wants his own game area."
344,ep143,"I mean, it's plenty of space but I really, really wanted a finished basement, you know."
345,ep143,I feel like this is gonna put me at the top end.
346,ep143,"Yes. I'm concerned about that, you know, quality of life, being able to travel, being able to do..."
347,ep143,This is a big project.
348,ep143,[dramatic music playing]
349,ep143,"I like how much this looks like mom's, but not."
350,ep143,It's very modern.
351,ep143,But there's no outdoor living space.
352,ep143,And we didn't have a finished basement.
353,ep143,"I like that there was a playground, there's a basketball court, and then, like..."
354,ep143,Yeah. there's an HOA.
355,ep143,-I know.
356,ep143,"LaChelle loves the amenities, but she hates HOAs."
357,ep143,She's gotta pick one.
358,ep143,"Well, you know what?"
359,ep143,-We'll keep looking.
360,ep143,-Yeah. me what else.
361,ep143,All right.
362,ep143,-Let's see what else we got.
363,ep143,[dramatic music playing]
364,ep143,"Another house in Stafford has become available, so that's where they're headed next."
365,ep143,"It's a little bit over, but it has a finished basement."
366,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
367,ep143,Single mom LaChelle won't settle until she can find the perfect home outside DC with enough sophisticated flair for her and room to play and grow for her son.
368,ep143,She and agent Nicole are in Stafford again.
369,ep143,"It's farther than LaChelle would like, but large homes are available here for reasonable prices."
370,ep143,-This is five bedrooms.
371,ep143,Girl. know.
372,ep143,-Okay. been upgraded throughout.
373,ep143,-This one was built in 1998.
374,ep143,-Okay. see what energy I get there.
375,ep143,I know.
376,ep143,Let's see what the energy is...
377,ep143,"you know, give it a chance."
378,ep143,"It's a little bit over, but it has a finished basement."
379,ep143,"But it's a very low HOA, and it's an annual HOA, -so not too bad."
380,ep143,Okay. kind of cool.
381,ep143,-Right. a community pool here.
382,ep143,Nice. have a love-hate with the HOA.
383,ep143,"It definitely has a purpose but sometimes they can be intrusive, so I'm hoping that that's not the case, because so far so good with the neighborhood."
384,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
385,ep143,I think that we're on the money on this one.
386,ep143,Look at this.
387,ep143,It definitely has a presence right -when we pull up...
388,ep143,Yes. beautiful mosaic door...
389,ep143,"Oh, okay."
390,ep143,"Like that's really, really nice, Nicole."
391,ep143,I love this door.
392,ep143,So the home that we're going to see today is a lot bigger than a lot of the homes I've already seen.
393,ep143,And it costs a little bit more than a lot of the homes we've already seen.
394,ep143,But LaChelle has stated that she wants something bigger.
395,ep143,It has a lot of upgrades.
396,ep143,So I think she'll like that.
397,ep143,"Oh, wow."
398,ep143,Look at the staircase.
399,ep143,This is the type of presence I was talking about.
400,ep143,Yes. hardwoods?
401,ep143,-Kind of cherry wood.
402,ep143,-Cherry. digging it.
403,ep143,"This is beautiful, Nicole."
404,ep143,Ooh. my gosh.
405,ep143,"It has this gourmet, Italiano..."
406,ep143,Yes. happening.
407,ep143,"Wow. like it, actually."
408,ep143,"Right? giving you like a Janet Jackson sexy, -not Cardi B sexy."
409,ep143,-Indeed. it's still that open layout.
410,ep143,But this would have to go.
411,ep143,-I'm not...
412,ep143,"-Oh, is that a angel?"
413,ep143,-Yeah. wrapped some...
414,ep143,"-Oh, you know what..."
415,ep143,Maybe that's why I don't feel any energy in here.
416,ep143,I felt good energy so far.
417,ep143,I don't know.
418,ep143,It feels good so far.
419,ep143,"I definitely wanna take a look at this, Nicole, because this space is awesome."
420,ep143,So are you a real outdoorsy type of person when you really utilize this back?
421,ep143,You know what's funny?
422,ep143,I'm totally not.
423,ep143,But I want the space anyway.
424,ep143,"Right. want it, but you don't wanna use it, but you wanna know that you have it."
425,ep143,"I wanna be able to, you know what I mean?"
426,ep143,And I definitely I wanna be more social.
427,ep143,"So I want the spaces to do it, I wanna put like an umbrella out here..."
428,ep143,"Okay. you know, like a grill top."
429,ep143,I can definitely do a lot with it.
430,ep143,So it's pretty nice so far.
431,ep143,Yeah. the downstairs.
432,ep143,Okay. is this here?
433,ep143,Ooh. detail.
434,ep143,-Like another dining.
435,ep143,-This is so much space.
436,ep143,Yes. dining.
437,ep143,A piano will be gorgeous in here.
438,ep143,"And actually, what I really wanted to take up that I haven't even told you, cello."
439,ep143,"Okay, girl."
440,ep143,"-Yeah, girl."
441,ep143,I like it a lot.
442,ep143,That's nice.
443,ep143,I like how wide these stairs are.
444,ep143,We both can walk up here together...
445,ep143,"Yeah, we can."
446,ep143,-...which awesome.
447,ep143,So first thing.
448,ep143,Carpet. now sound like my son.
449,ep143,"Right. yeah, I don't like this carpet at all."
450,ep143,I would...
451,ep143,I would want there to be hardwoods up here.
452,ep143,Okay. check out this bathroom.
453,ep143,Okay. we got a little dating on some of the tile here with the...
454,ep143,We've got the Beauty and the Beast like rose.
455,ep143,This bathroom's not quite my style.
456,ep143,"Right. you already have the bones, the double vanity."
457,ep143,This can easily be upgraded.
458,ep143,Yeah. hall back here.
459,ep143,I guess this is maybe Jaxon's bathroom?
460,ep143,Right. take a look at this room here.
461,ep143,-Okay. size room.
462,ep143,Very nice size.
463,ep143,Light... of light coming in.
464,ep143,Okay. you wouldn't have to worry about replacing this carpet because Jaxon wants carpet under his toes.
465,ep143,"Oh, we're gonna cut it off right here..."
466,ep143,because this is not...
467,ep143,This would have to all be hardwood.
468,ep143,-Right. that's expensive.
469,ep143,"$515,000 being at my ceiling already, it makes me really kind of uncomfortable that there are some projects still left to do here."
470,ep143,It's probably too much space maybe?
471,ep143,You're the only one I know who complains about too much space.
472,ep143,How could there ever?
473,ep143,"All these extra bedrooms, you can make all these beautiful closets, one for your shoes, one for your clothes."
474,ep143,So I think it's a great possibility for her.
475,ep143,-Is this a wet bar?
476,ep143,"-Yes, let's do this."
477,ep143,"Something I don't have to put in here, you know, I'm liking that because I'm already seeing some projects upstairs."
478,ep143,"So there's more bedrooms, Nicole?"
479,ep143,Wow. my God.
480,ep143,"Oh, my God."
481,ep143,"I want a lot of space, but I think there is such thing as too much space."
482,ep143,-Nicole. bedroom?
483,ep143,Another bedroom.
484,ep143,"Well... wait, wait."
485,ep143,Let's not look at this as a bedroom.
486,ep143,This could be a media room.
487,ep143,-You could put some...
488,ep143,-Media... could be Jaxon's gaming room.
489,ep143,This is nice.
490,ep143,-That out there is for mommy.
491,ep143,[dramatic music playing]
492,ep143,I can't really say a lot bad about it.
493,ep143,-It's gorgeous.
494,ep143,Yeah. love the deck.
495,ep143,The fact that that basement is what it is I would totally utilize all of that down there.
496,ep143,My main issue is that it's huge.
497,ep143,There's so many rooms that are unnecessary.
498,ep143,I'm not sure.
499,ep143,"I'm not sure, Nicole."
500,ep143,I have some things to think about.
501,ep143,"I really wanna give Jaxon stability, and that gives me a little bit of pressure to make the right choice and the right decision."
502,ep143,[dramatic music playing]
503,ep143,-How are you?
504,ep143,-How are you?
505,ep143,"Single mom LaChelle has been searching the suburbs of Virginia to find a home for herself and her son, Jaxon."
506,ep143,"After seeing several very different options, she's ready to narrow it down to one."
507,ep143,"I think of them like men, you know?"
508,ep143,"Let's just lay out here the good, the bad, and the ugly."
509,ep143,-Okay. guy A...
510,ep143,"...the that's a little older, it is open, and it did have upgraded appliances."
511,ep143,The bathrooms were small.
512,ep143,"We have our own, but we have to go to different levels for them -and they're both small."
513,ep143,"Exactly. you know, my main point of bringing you there is the location."
514,ep143,-You wanna be closer to DC.
515,ep143,Right. have more room to actually build onto the home.
516,ep143,That yard.
517,ep143,"Oh, yeah."
518,ep143,That's a project in and of itself.
519,ep143,"But again, this one is only $399,000 and it does give me room to do more."
520,ep143,-The new build.
521,ep143,Okay. he has little miles.
522,ep143,Oh. I like that one.
523,ep143,Okay. the finishes that I wanted.
524,ep143,-Sexy... sophisticated.
525,ep143,It is.
526,ep143,So we're liking him for me.
527,ep143,-Mmm-hmm. of a deck.
528,ep143,And the basement's unfinished.
529,ep143,"So those are two things to consider, you know?"
530,ep143,"And it'll be pricey too, Nicole."
531,ep143,-They are.
532,ep143,The traditional.
533,ep143,I like the presence when you drive up.
534,ep143,"Okay. what did get me, that $515,000, there's not a lot of room for any projects, but there were a couple inside because it's a little bit older."
535,ep143,But that beautiful kitchen...
536,ep143,"Oh, girl."
537,ep143,"That Janet Jackson sexy, -that grown and sexy?"
538,ep143,-It was just...
539,ep143,-It's a mature sexy.
540,ep143,-It is.
541,ep143,But five bedrooms.
542,ep143,Five bedrooms.
543,ep143,"Every time we turned around, -there was another door..."
544,ep143,-[Nicole laughs]
545,ep143,"...and bedroom, right?"
546,ep143,"Like, that was..."
547,ep143,I don't know that I need all that.
548,ep143,[upbeat music playing]
549,ep143,[doorbell chimes]
550,ep143,Jaxon. kick the office door.
551,ep143,So I chose the new construction because it had everything that I wanted.
552,ep143,"This furniture gets here tomorrow, all of that's done."
553,ep143,"I closed six days ago, I will be moving in tomorrow, I'm really excited to set up."
554,ep143,Looks like we got some bathroom stuff.
555,ep143,I was really disappointed in the beginning that there wasn't a finished deck or a finished basement.
556,ep143,"After thinking about it, running the numbers, I have some time."
557,ep143,"This is gonna be a home I intend to stay in for a long time, and so I have time to get those two projects knocked out."
558,ep143,"-I want them lighter, Mom."
559,ep143,-You want it lighter?
560,ep143,Watch when your shower curtain...
561,ep143,-Yeah. is gonna be perfect.
562,ep143,"I'm a mom, but I also have this young single thing going on, so I feel like this house is sexy enough to represent that, but also family-oriented enough to represent the fact that I'm a parent, so this house is perfect for me."
563,ep143,"And when the washer/dryer gets here, we'll just get them hung up, okay?"
564,ep143,I love the house my mom picked.
565,ep143,"It had a lot of space and, like, a space for gaming."
566,ep143,"It's just not finished yet, but I can work with it."
567,ep143,"You're gonna go all the way up, -or are you still scared?"
568,ep143,-I can't do that.
569,ep143,I did not want an HOA.
570,ep143,"This community gives me a lot for the HOA, so that kinda..."
571,ep143,It offset the fact that I still have one.
572,ep143,That's the blue I wanted for my towels.
573,ep143,It feels amazing to finally have a place I can call my long-term home.
574,ep143,"I think Jaxon's thrilled, we can put down the roots that I originally wanted to put down, and just get our lives going."
1,ep144,"Oh, wow."
2,ep144,High ceilings.
3,ep144,I love this.
4,ep144,Chantelle a first timer in the L.A.
5,ep144,"area's white hot market, so she's brought her real estate savvy dad along for advice."
6,ep144,What's the competition like?
7,ep144,"I spoke with the agent, she already has four verbal offers."
8,ep144,-Oh. verbal is verbal.
9,ep144,But while Dad's knowledge can be a perk...
10,ep144,"You're gonna actually probably wanna offer maybe $25,000 more..."
11,ep144,Mm-hmm. to be competitive.
12,ep144,...his eye can be a bit too critical for her.
13,ep144,"He's looking at the plugs and the details, and I just want, I just want it to be pretty."
14,ep144,Wow! at the floor.
15,ep144,This is vinyl plank.
16,ep144,"This ceiling is a popcorn ceiling, it's very dated."
17,ep144,"Look at the grout lines, Oh, my gosh."
18,ep144,Again with the grout.
19,ep144,it needs little cleaning.
20,ep144,"Oh, my gosh, enough with the details."
21,ep144,Let's just look at how pretty it is.
22,ep144,Let's go outside.
23,ep144,Let's go see what everyone's doing.
24,ep144,I am customer success manager at a software tech company and then I also run my online health and wellness business on the side.
25,ep144,"I currently live with my mom, my dad and my sister."
26,ep144,"I actually don't live in the main home, I live actually in the garage but it's a big enough room, and I feel like I'm living in my own studio."
27,ep144,"Hey, guys."
28,ep144,What are you doing?
29,ep144,"-Hey, babe."
30,ep144,"-Hey. goal was to buy my first property by age 30 and I'm 28, and I felt like it was time for me to move out and so, living at home gave me the option to save money and start my search two years early."
31,ep144,I'm so excited but I'm also nervous at the same time.
32,ep144,"I'm excited that you're at least taking Dad with you because you know you're gonna walk in and be like ""Look how beautiful everything is"" and Dad's gonna be like, ""Look at the skeleton of everything."""
33,ep144,"""What's the spot on that bowl?"""
34,ep144,"Gotta have someone doing that, you know, the reality check on what you need."
35,ep144,"My wife and I have bought investment properties and built several others, so I have a great deal of knowledge when it comes to building and buying."
36,ep144,"When I walk into a house, I wanna soak up the vibe, the energy, I want it to feel good, I want it to look good, and that's where it gets a little complicated 'cause when he walks in, he puts his builder hat on and he's looking at the plugs and the details and all these little nitty gritty things and I just want, I just want it to be pretty."
37,ep144,This Barbie has got to have her perfect doll house.
38,ep144,Chantelle's oasis.
39,ep144,I'm not open to a single family home.
40,ep144,"I don't have a husband, I don't have kids, so I'm just looking for townhomes and condos."
41,ep144,You don't wanna do gardening and home maintenance...
42,ep144,-No. pool repairs?
43,ep144,-Why? yet.
44,ep144,You know there's so many things that I've always dreamed of having in a home.
45,ep144,"I have always wanted the Spanish archways -Yeah, like we have in our arches here."
46,ep144,-Yeah. we have a combination of old and new.
47,ep144,I do want a modern home.
48,ep144,"I'm really obsessed with recess lighting, high ceilings, but I do love a Spanish architecture."
49,ep144,"My mom is born and raised in Ecuador, and I just wanted to bring some flavor back in."
50,ep144,Like some Spanish tile on the roof.
51,ep144,"Sometimes you see that Tuscan, Mediterranean balconies."
52,ep144,"I just want to be able to stand on my balcony and have that beautiful view, just like Ecuador so I definitely want a balcony, at least one."
53,ep144,"I would recommend a covered balcony because you're covered from the rain, from the elements."
54,ep144,It doesn't rain that much.
55,ep144,I can deal with that.
56,ep144,I definitely want an open floor plan where it feels like you can walk around and it just looks big.
57,ep144,"I want the kitchen to feel open, and I want marble countertops, and white cabinets ready to go and already there."
58,ep144,"So, let me give you a reality check."
59,ep144,"Most of the condos that you're gonna be looking at marble is very far and few between, -few and far between."
60,ep144,-It's luxurious and I'm going for luxurious look.
61,ep144,"You know, granite is acceptable -and there's, you know."
62,ep144,-I don't think so.
63,ep144,-Do you want a roommate?
64,ep144,-I do want a roommate.
65,ep144,I think it'll just help to have the company especially for my first property.
66,ep144,"So I definitely am looking for a 2 bedroom, 2 bath."
67,ep144,"Like, where do you want to live?"
68,ep144,"I think I want to live no more than 25, 30 miles from this home, and I love the area growing up here, so I definitely want to stay close."
69,ep144,"-I've always said, get a gated community."
70,ep144,-Yes. think that might be-- -Why?
71,ep144,"Why do we need a like, why do we need a gated community?"
72,ep144,'Cause there's so much safety and security in a gated community.
73,ep144,"If it's not in the price range that I'm looking for, -I don't really know if I need one."
74,ep144,-Let's just...
75,ep144,The max I can spend would be 5.75.
76,ep144,But I'm more comfortable spending around 4.75.
77,ep144,"You know, you can afford more, we got pre approval."
78,ep144,"Let's just go for the max that we can and get what you want, and so..."
79,ep144,It just really makes me nervous to go that high.
80,ep144,"It might be above your comfort range, but you can do this."
81,ep144,"Today, Chantelle's agent has lined up a townhome in Agoura Hill."
82,ep144,"We're going to go see a 2 bedroom, 2 bath."
83,ep144,"-Okay, just what I asked."
84,ep144,Perfect. square feet.
85,ep144,-Okay. small.
86,ep144,"Yeah, priced at $4,98,000."
87,ep144,"Okay, that's in my price range."
88,ep144,That's definitely what I like to hear.
89,ep144,Wow. is gorgeous.
90,ep144,Palm trees.
91,ep144,I love a good palm tree.
92,ep144,Are these townhomes or condos?
93,ep144,These are listed as townhomes.
94,ep144,"As Chantelle is a good friend of mine that I met through my girlfriend, she's like the sweetest person ever."
95,ep144,"But having Gary come with us makes me nervous 'cause in real estate we always joke that parents are deal killers, right."
96,ep144,"They come and and start pointing everything out, and pretty much scare the buyer from moving forward."
97,ep144,"So it's tricky here because Gary is very smart knows the stuff, but Chantelle's ultimately my client."
98,ep144,"So I want to make her happy, but I also want to make Gary feel confident."
99,ep144,Looks like there's not really a curb or room to walk here.
100,ep144,"Right. mean, easy if you have to carry groceries."
101,ep144,"And visitors, where do they park?"
102,ep144,The visitors park on the street.
103,ep144,Mm. not really preferred.
104,ep144,"Okay. do like that everything is white cabinets, so far."
105,ep144,"-That's a perk, I love that."
106,ep144,"-Right. not really a big fan of the low ceilings, -I definitely wanted high ceilings."
107,ep144,"-Okay. do you think about this, Gary?"
108,ep144,Granite's nice.
109,ep144,I did want white marble.
110,ep144,"Yeah. know, a brighter look."
111,ep144,"I do love that the kitchen opens up to the dining area, that is a good perk."
112,ep144,"Now, take a look at the flooring, Chantelle."
113,ep144,What about it?
114,ep144,"This is grout lines that are light, they show dirt and they're really hard to maintain."
115,ep144,And this is door to where?
116,ep144,This is to the outside.
117,ep144,"Okay, so there's a door on this side -and then a door on that side."
118,ep144,-Right. it open to the public access?
119,ep144,"Yeah, I mean, this isn't gated."
120,ep144,"So, there's..."
121,ep144,"Obviously, if someone wanted to walk in."
122,ep144,"-Yeah. burglar, a thief can be walking around out there."
123,ep144,"I mean, my biggest concern is that she's safe."
124,ep144,I want her to be in a safe situation.
125,ep144,"Yeah, check out one of the biggest benefits."
126,ep144,-The patio.
127,ep144,-That's the patio.
128,ep144,"-Oh, this is nice."
129,ep144,-Yeah. really quiet and kind of to yourself.
130,ep144,I have a big concern about this being opened -versus covered.
131,ep144,-What's wrong with that?
132,ep144,-I don't care about it cover-- -It means that you are open to the elements.
133,ep144,You've got to enjoy the best of Southern California.
134,ep144,"Exactly. to Edward, you've got to enjoy the best of California."
135,ep144,I will say the living room is a little small for me especially 'cause I do want to be able to provide a space that's entertaining and for people to come over.
136,ep144,And then is that a second patio I see?
137,ep144,"Yeah, that is a second patio."
138,ep144,"I originally wanted balconies, this is a home with patios and I really want a view."
139,ep144,"So, this I would have to get creative with the patios."
140,ep144,This is what?
141,ep144,"Um, a heater."
142,ep144,-It's an air conditioning unit.
143,ep144,-You were close.
144,ep144,"And this is open to the elements, so it gets rained on which means it's gonna break down quicker."
145,ep144,It's a very old unit.
146,ep144,The home warranty will cover that.
147,ep144,Does she pay for it or the seller?
148,ep144,Right now with the market usually the buyer's paying for it.
149,ep144,And how much are home warranties and what do they cover?
150,ep144,Year about $550 to 600 -for a home warranty for something like this.
151,ep144,-Okay. a big chunk.
152,ep144,"You're covering the AC, you're covering mostly all appliances and things like that."
153,ep144,"-Oh, man."
154,ep144,-Garbage is-- Extra cost.
155,ep144,I'm not happy with that.
156,ep144,So I see that there's stairs.
157,ep144,"-[Edward ]Yeah,"
158,ep144,so... it's like a two story?
159,ep144,"Two story, both bedrooms are upstairs."
160,ep144,"Okay, this is a nice bathroom, it looks like."
161,ep144,-It's spacious.
162,ep144,-Do you feel spacious in this bathroom?
163,ep144,"Yeah, I feel like this is a spacious bathroom."
164,ep144,I feel like I'm walking right up the stairs into the bathroom.
165,ep144,It's like very cramped.
166,ep144,"I like that there's a tub, -that's important."
167,ep144,I do love the bathtub environment.
168,ep144,"Yeah, there's a tub."
169,ep144,"And there's big grout lines in the shower and you have water running all day, it breaks down the grout lines."
170,ep144,But I'll clean it.
171,ep144,I'll make sure to clean.
172,ep144,"It's not about cleaning, it's about wear and tear over time."
173,ep144,But it's a nice tile work.
174,ep144,Okay. this is the main bedroom.
175,ep144,"Yeah, it's a little small but the view!"
176,ep144,"Wow, the view is great."
177,ep144,What is this fence?
178,ep144,Looks like it's a penitentiary surrounding a jail yard.
179,ep144,It's fine.
180,ep144,"Look at the view, you're looking across from it."
181,ep144,"You can see the mountains, look at it, it's gorgeous."
182,ep144,I have no idea what my dad is talking about with the penitentiary thing.
183,ep144,"I don't know where he took that from or where he got it from, but my dad can be a Debbie downer."
184,ep144,So this is going to be the roommate's room.
185,ep144,It's very small.
186,ep144,I don't like that it's separated by one little wall.
187,ep144,"Overall, how do you feel?"
188,ep144,This is great simple home.
189,ep144,"And the view, the view in the main bedroom is..."
190,ep144,"I just think, the layout of this, I kinda wanted it to be more open."
191,ep144,I wouldn't know how to open this space up.
192,ep144,I really want Spanish style.
193,ep144,Are you open to going up in price?
194,ep144,"We might be able to go a little bit, you know, out of your comfort range You always are asking me to up it, I don't want to up."
195,ep144,I just wanna see other homes within the same price range.
196,ep144,"But you might have to go a little bit out of your comfort range but still affordable, you know, you can do this."
197,ep144,So Chantelle agrees to see a more expensive place.
198,ep144,It's pretty.
199,ep144,"That's what's most important, I like, I want to feel like it's pretty."
200,ep144,"I thought you would love this, -it's a 2 bedroom, 2 bath."
201,ep144,-Okay. a little over 1300 square feet.
202,ep144,"-Wow, it's big."
203,ep144,-That's nice size.
204,ep144,"Priced at $5,09,000."
205,ep144,"Oh, that's a little high."
206,ep144,But Chantelle may have to spend that to get her first home in competitive SoCal.
207,ep144,And her real estate savvy dad thinks it may be worth it.
208,ep144,What would the mortgage be on a place like that?
209,ep144,Around $2800.
210,ep144,"Oh, my gosh."
211,ep144,That's so scary.
212,ep144,"Just because I don't even pay rent right now, you know, and I'm gonna all of a sudden pay this huge mortgage?"
213,ep144,If you feel like 5.09
214,ep144,"is a lot, -but you're approved..."
215,ep144,-It is a lot.
216,ep144,...for to 5.75.
217,ep144,Is this it?
218,ep144,This is it.
219,ep144,I love the Spanish architect on the outside.
220,ep144,-That's really key.
221,ep144,-Right. at how well maintained this...
222,ep144,HOA has taken care of the gardens.
223,ep144,"Yeah, I can see that."
224,ep144,"Trees are gorgeous and the landscape, but the beautiful thing about this property is that it's gated, it's private, it's high security, and she's in a very nice area of Simi Valley."
225,ep144,"Oh wow, well, first of all, the carpets look really dirty."
226,ep144,You can always clean it.
227,ep144,"Oh, wow."
228,ep144,High ceilings.
229,ep144,I love this.
230,ep144,Look at this.
231,ep144,-What? a broken switch.
232,ep144,"Oh, my gosh."
233,ep144,"You're looking at the plugs, we literally just walked in."
234,ep144,Can you picture yourself here?
235,ep144,"I mean, the space is great, right?"
236,ep144,"Yeah. mean, so far from what I've seen, it feels like open and it's pretty."
237,ep144,That's what's most important.
238,ep144,"I like, I want to feel like it's pretty."
239,ep144,What do you think of that kitchen?
240,ep144,"Oh, I wanted white marble and white cabinets and I just wanted it to be really bright."
241,ep144,Yeah. the biggest fan.
242,ep144,"Here, look, you have granite like our counters at home."
243,ep144,White cabinets here?
244,ep144,"No. this is maple, you know how beautiful maple is?"
245,ep144,You do.
246,ep144,I really just want white marble and white cabinets.
247,ep144,So this is the main balcony?
248,ep144,That is the main balcony.
249,ep144,"Oh. the view, it's of the parking lot."
250,ep144,You see the mountains right over the houses there?
251,ep144,"-No, I don't see them."
252,ep144,You see you have a cover over your head?
253,ep144,I see parking lot.
254,ep144,I don't care about a cover at all.
255,ep144,What if birds come by and poop on you -and it's uncovered?
256,ep144,-What? are you thinking of that?
257,ep144,What about being out here in the rain?
258,ep144,I don't know.
259,ep144,I'm not happy with the view of the parking lot.
260,ep144,"I love cars, but not enough to have it as a view."
261,ep144,I love the Spanish archways that just go right into the hallway.
262,ep144,-So I assume the rooms are all back there.
263,ep144,Right. I guess this would be...
264,ep144,The guest room?
265,ep144,This is the guest bedroom.
266,ep144,Good size.
267,ep144,Carpet is a little dirty.
268,ep144,These are custom blinds.
269,ep144,"Oh, wow."
270,ep144,-These are custom made for these windows.
271,ep144,I guess they have to be because the windows are not normal size.
272,ep144,-So this is the main bedroom?
273,ep144,The main bedroom.
274,ep144,What do you think of that?
275,ep144,I love the high ceilings first of all.
276,ep144,I feel like they're very spacious.
277,ep144,"Oh, wow."
278,ep144,The bathroom even has a Spanish archway.
279,ep144,-Nice. love this.
280,ep144,"And then the bathroom, oh, well, this is coming, too."
281,ep144,"Wow, this is great."
282,ep144,That's a Roman bathtub.
283,ep144,I love that.
284,ep144,And even the shower is nice.
285,ep144,Beautiful. at that.
286,ep144,-It needs a little cleaning.
287,ep144,"-Oh my gosh, enough with the details."
288,ep144,Just look how pretty it is.
289,ep144,This is what I wanted to show you.
290,ep144,"Oh, but what the heck, there's a tree right here."
291,ep144,"Well, if you stand on the right here, -you'll have a view."
292,ep144,"-So if I stand right here, I can enjoy."
293,ep144,"Oh, I can see it, way far."
294,ep144,"There are lots of things that I do like, but on a 509 house, we're probably not gonna pay that price."
295,ep144,We're probably going to have to go above or what do you think?
296,ep144,"Well, in this market you are definitely going to go above."
297,ep144,Cost is such an issue to me.
298,ep144,I don't know.
299,ep144,"I think we should still look at other places, maybe something on the cheaper side."
300,ep144,I think that would maybe fit my needs better.
301,ep144,"But cheaper isn't always better, honey."
302,ep144,[upbeat music playing]
303,ep144,"Since Chantelle doesn't want to spend big, her agent lines up a lower price condo, that he hopes she'll love."
304,ep144,It's a little dated.
305,ep144,The fixtures are old.
306,ep144,The whole thing -would need to be changed.
307,ep144,[upbeat music playing]
308,ep144,This is Westlake Village.
309,ep144,This is right next to my favorite winery.
310,ep144,This is like my spot.
311,ep144,I hang out in here.
312,ep144,-Right. for dating.
313,ep144,"-Yeah, perfect for dating."
314,ep144,"We're gonna go see a two bedroom, two bath."
315,ep144,How much is it?
316,ep144,-460. in Westlake Village.
317,ep144,That's such a luxury location.
318,ep144,Never thought Westlake was affordable.
319,ep144,What's the competition like?
320,ep144,Do you know of any other options?
321,ep144,I spoke with the agent.
322,ep144,She already has four verbal offers.
323,ep144,-Oh. is verbal.
324,ep144,Yeah. does this remind you of Ecuador?
325,ep144,-It does.
326,ep144,"The Spanish tile roof, the stucco, it's very, very South American."
327,ep144,"Although it's not gated, how is the security from the public access?"
328,ep144,"I mean, it's a very safe community."
329,ep144,It's important.
330,ep144,-Wait till you see this.
331,ep144,"-Okay, I'm super excited."
332,ep144,"Wow, look at the floor."
333,ep144,-I have the same flooring in my room.
334,ep144,"-This is vinyl plank, -which we like."
335,ep144,It's a beautiful balcony.
336,ep144,-This is big patio.
337,ep144,-Is this the only patio?
338,ep144,"-Yeah. not really too stoked about the views, but I love the big patio."
339,ep144,-We have coverage.
340,ep144,-This is great.
341,ep144,I love this.
342,ep144,-Protection from the rain.
343,ep144,"-Covered, yeah, no rain, no birds pooping."
344,ep144,-So far so good.
345,ep144,"I thought you could put your couch right here, -have the TV up."
346,ep144,-Yeah. is a great spot for a TV.
347,ep144,"The ceiling is a little low, but that doesn't bother me 'cause I love the flooring."
348,ep144,I also noticed there is no lighting in this place.
349,ep144,It looks like it's just lamps.
350,ep144,"So, how much would it cost, Dad, if we were to put recess lighting?"
351,ep144,This ceiling is a popcorn ceiling.
352,ep144,It's very dated.
353,ep144,-Yeah. it would have to be scraped.
354,ep144,"And then to put in recess lighting, you're looking at about $5,000 - $7,000 to scrape and put recess lighting in."
355,ep144,"And then, the kitchen, looks like this is a little bit of an enclosed kitchen."
356,ep144,I did want an open space kind of a kitchen to entertain my guests.
357,ep144,-Right. love that the cabinets are white.
358,ep144,-That's definitely ideal what I wanted.
359,ep144,-They're dated a little bit.
360,ep144,"The hinges are old, but you can make that different."
361,ep144,This can definitely be upgraded.
362,ep144,-Look at the grout lines...
363,ep144,"-Oh, my God, again with the grout."
364,ep144,Another thing to consider is obviously getting a fridge.
365,ep144,"Oh, there's no fridge?"
366,ep144,"Oh, I have to buy a fridge."
367,ep144,"So then, this is the first bedroom."
368,ep144,This is the guest.
369,ep144,-Okay. this is a decent sized guest.
370,ep144,"Okay, so then this is the main bedroom."
371,ep144,"Wow, this is nice."
372,ep144,I love the natural light.
373,ep144,"-Look, how big this window is."
374,ep144,-Natural light.
375,ep144,"Wow, I mean, it's not the best view, but the light in here..."
376,ep144,Oh. door is for the private bathroom.
377,ep144,-Right. there's no tub.
378,ep144,"So, you can create a tub shower."
379,ep144,There's a cost.
380,ep144,"-Okay. a little dated, the fixtures are old."
381,ep144,The whole thing would need to be changed.
382,ep144,"Yeah, well, I was really excited about the price."
383,ep144,Now I'm realizing there's gonna be more...
384,ep144,We have to have an exhaust fan in here.
385,ep144,Is this a walk-in closet?
386,ep144,This is it.
387,ep144,"Wow, this is like a third bedroom."
388,ep144,"Overall, I do think the layout is nice."
389,ep144,It does seem there are gonna be some upgrades I'm gonna need to make.
390,ep144,We're not looking at 460 anymore.
391,ep144,We're probably looking at a little bit more above.
392,ep144,So couple things.
393,ep144,"You'll come in at the listing price of 460, you're gonna actually probably wanna offer maybe $25,000 more -just to be competitive."
394,ep144,"-Right. then if you win the bid, then you're talking about another $30,000 maybe in upgrades."
395,ep144,"Don't get concerned because you have that latitude being, you know, at 575, you could do that."
396,ep144,[upbeat music playing]
397,ep144,"Dad, this looks amazing."
398,ep144,I'm sad that this is only a weekend thing.
399,ep144,"With the help of her Dad, Chantelle's been searching for her first home in a very competitive market."
400,ep144,"Now, it's time to make a decision."
401,ep144,The first home we saw was in Agoura hills.
402,ep144,Do you know how I was telling you I really want like a Spanish-Mediterranean vibe?
403,ep144,It didn't have any of that.
404,ep144,"But, it did have the white cabinets which I love."
405,ep144,"The kitchen was a little closed on one side, but it does face the dining table."
406,ep144,"So, it has some sort of an entertainment space."
407,ep144,It did feel cramped.
408,ep144,"There were low ceilings, -but the views were spectacular."
409,ep144,-The view is incredible.
410,ep144,"You didn't have any balcony, and the downstairs patios, they were small."
411,ep144,-How much was it?
412,ep144,-It was around 498.
413,ep144,I'm open to it 'cause it is on the cheaper side.
414,ep144,I wanna tell you about the Simi Valley one.
415,ep144,It was really pretty.
416,ep144,"It did have the Spanish Mediterranean archways, and I loved that."
417,ep144,"It had high ceilings, a very open floor plan."
418,ep144,"But, I didn't have the white marble, the white cabinets."
419,ep144,It's wood and it's granite.
420,ep144,"So, it's totally different look."
421,ep144,"They did have balconies which I liked, but the balcony was staring at the parking lot and it's priced at 509."
422,ep144,You're gonna have multiple full-price or way above full-price offers.
423,ep144,"You may have to offer 550 or 560 to get that property, -which you can afford."
424,ep144,"-Wait, I wanna hear more about the Westlake one."
425,ep144,"So, the Westlake location, it's right across from our favorite winery."
426,ep144,Beautiful area.
427,ep144,Spanish style Mediterranean.
428,ep144,And the layout was beautiful.
429,ep144,"You walk in, there's an open layout and it did have that vinyl plank flooring that I love."
430,ep144,"But, the kitchen was closed."
431,ep144,"You know, we're gonna have to do a lot of renovation."
432,ep144,"Tub showers, scraping the ceilings, putting in recess lighting."
433,ep144,"But, it's the cheapest property."
434,ep144,"So, honey in this decision I want you to forget about the money."
435,ep144,You can afford this.
436,ep144,"You've worked hard, you've saved up."
437,ep144,"Find out what in your heart, is gonna make this place your everything."
438,ep144,I'm so confused.
439,ep144,I have no idea what to do.
440,ep144,[doorbell ringing]
441,ep144,-Massive. know.
442,ep144,I love it.
443,ep144,"I ended up choosing the Simi Valley home, because when I first walked in I just got a feeling, I knew it was the home for me."
444,ep144,"It had the Spanish architecture, the open floor plan, the Spanish archways."
445,ep144,This house had about 90% of everything I wanted.
446,ep144,"Also, while you guys are here, can I have you help build the beach row set before you leave?"
447,ep144,-That'd be great.
448,ep144,"-Yeah. were things that I didn't love about this place, like the cabinets not being white, the countertops not being white marble."
449,ep144,"But, because this house has so much to offer, I really wanted to go for it."
450,ep144,Look at my busy-bees working.
451,ep144,You guys are the best.
452,ep144,There was a bidding war.
453,ep144,There was about a 11 offers had to bid out.
454,ep144,"But I didn't know when Edward and my Dad were telling me I was going to have to go up, I knew I had to come out strong."
455,ep144,"So, we ended up offering 560, and they accepted."
456,ep144,"It says ""Step 1, attach backrest A,"" which is this."
457,ep144,"Chantelle, she was very scared going into the home that's over a half a million dollars."
458,ep144,"But, she's a hard worker, she's saved up, we had to constantly, you know, let her know that she could do this even though it may seem unreachable."
459,ep144,We're very proud of her.
460,ep144,"I have something that can make this a lot better and it's also something that I brought for you, so..."
461,ep144,I'll be right back.
462,ep144,"Having my Dad around, was the best decision, because I learned that details do matter, and I really learned that we really have to focus on these things because they play a part in your future life when you live there."
463,ep144,-Congratulations on your first new home.
464,ep144,"-Aww, thank you."
465,ep144,We gotta pop a bottle.
466,ep144,"I am so happy that I have this home, because my goal was to have a home by age 30."
467,ep144,"I'm 28, that's two years early."
468,ep144,"I'm able to buy a home by myself, on my income alone, and that makes me feel so proud of how hard I worked to get here."
469,ep144,Cheers. the best.
1,ep145,Wow. at that crown molding.
2,ep145,This is spectacular.
3,ep145,"After selling their DC home for big profit, Jeff and Daniel must find their next place fast."
4,ep145,But something is slowing them down.
5,ep145,Jeff and I are completely polar opposites.
6,ep145,Daniel is willing to spend big to get moving ready and grand.
7,ep145,I don't know if there's room for me to actually get a picture of them.
8,ep145,They've got a camera for that.
9,ep145,And we'll lose a few pounds and it'll be a grand space.
10,ep145,Jeff's all about getting a deal and is fine with projects.
11,ep145,You could add this all into the house.
12,ep145,"The value is there, right?"
13,ep145,Can they find a middle ground so they can get on with what's really important to them?
14,ep145,There's just way too much repairs.
15,ep145,"By the time we're done with this, I'm too old to have a kid."
16,ep145,[theme music playing]
17,ep145,It's kind of crazy if you think about it.
18,ep145,"Twenty years ago or so, we both came to Washington."
19,ep145,You were a staff assistant.
20,ep145,"I was so proud to be making $23,000 a year on Capitol Hill."
21,ep145,"I'm a POGO affairs consultant here in Washington, DC."
22,ep145,And I work as chief of staff on Capitol Hill.
23,ep145,We met through a matchmaking service.
24,ep145,"Fifteen months later, he popped the question in Paris on a suspension bridge no less."
25,ep145,"I said yes quickly because there was some kid at the end, jumping up and down the suspension bridge."
26,ep145,I was...
27,ep145,That was not really my jam.
28,ep145,We're living in the house that we sold.
29,ep145,Part of the deal was to lease back so we could hopefully find something else to move to.
30,ep145,"We put a little over $300,000 into it."
31,ep145,"Really, you know, bringing out those historic details."
32,ep145,I never thought it would increase in value so quickly.
33,ep145,"We found out that we could sell it for $2,000,000."
34,ep145,We had just bought it for 1.3
35,ep145,just four short years ago.
36,ep145,Which would let us then go find another home and also have the funds to start a family through adoption or surrogacy.
37,ep145,"We are very, very picky which concerns me because we've got six weeks before we need to be out of our home."
38,ep145,We're under a time crunch right now.
39,ep145,We gotta find something soon.
40,ep145,-Hello. how's it going?
41,ep145,"-Hey, John."
42,ep145,-Great. agent is my old college roommate.
43,ep145,He's done all of our real estate transactions.
44,ep145,The biggest challenge is Jeff and I are completely polar opposites.
45,ep145,I definitely am more analytical whereas Daniel tends to go more with the heart.
46,ep145,"I'm a Sagittarius, so I can get very emotional, make very rash decisions."
47,ep145,"I'm a fire sign, and I'm a Sag."
48,ep145,You know me.
49,ep145,I make decisions very quick.
50,ep145,I don't really follow the signs but I'm sure it's important.
51,ep145,"I mean, I'd really like one of those, like, classic Georgetown federal homes, you know, some of that history would be really cool."
52,ep145,Federal is more of a box.
53,ep145,"It's like, you know, just..."
54,ep145,And it's just...
55,ep145,I love a historic home that is architecturally Victorian.
56,ep145,"I like tall ceilings, you know, 10 to 11-foot high."
57,ep145,So the room feels big and grand.
58,ep145,I hope we can find a house in the city in a more walkable neighborhood.
59,ep145,"For me, the suburbs I'd be willing to look out because I enjoy having a quieter block for a family."
60,ep145,A little bit farther out gives us a good yard for our dog Lucy.
61,ep145,I'd spend up 2.1
62,ep145,million to find that dream home without having to do renovations again.
63,ep145,I'd prefer to stay closer to one-five range even if it requires more renovation to get it to where we need.
64,ep145,But we're also gonna grow a family.
65,ep145,You know how much toll it takes to actually be doing some construction work and also raise...
66,ep145,It's hard to do it around nap time.
67,ep145,That's one little issue.
68,ep145,"So, how much space do you think?"
69,ep145,Three or four bedrooms.
70,ep145,We need a place for my office.
71,ep145,I want my music room.
72,ep145,Also it would be nice to have a bonus space if a relative or au pair were to come to help us out.
73,ep145,I think I have a good sense of where we go.
74,ep145,We just need to find the right house and get you into it.
75,ep145,[upbeat music playing]
76,ep145,"Daniel and Jeff need to find a home within six weeks, get it under contract, and get it closed."
77,ep145,"If that doesn't happen, I'm gonna have to start showing them rentals."
78,ep145,So today he's meeting them at a place right in Georgetown with a price tag of 1.6
79,ep145,million for Jeff.
80,ep145,I do like the price and it looks like it's been on the market for at least six months.
81,ep145,That means that we could probably get a deal.
82,ep145,"Well, now I'm wondering why it's been on the market for six months."
83,ep145,[upbeat music playing]
84,ep145,"Oh, it's in an alleyway?"
85,ep145,It's a lane.
86,ep145,I'm not really thrilled about having a front door facing an alleyway -and garbage cans.
87,ep145,"Well, listen, we're in the heart of Georgetown."
88,ep145,We're gonna have to make some sacrifices.
89,ep145,This is quite quaint.
90,ep145,It looks on the smaller side.
91,ep145,That is of concern.
92,ep145,"I mean, I need my music room, you need your office."
93,ep145,This is good.
94,ep145,The parking pad is good.
95,ep145,I get to offload and on load.
96,ep145,"What is this, a modest..."
97,ep145,It's a modest federal?
98,ep145,It must not be original because you wouldn't have had a garage in front.
99,ep145,It's a quiet alley I think.
100,ep145,Good morning.
101,ep145,"Hi, John."
102,ep145,Is this a great location or what?
103,ep145,It's a good location.
104,ep145,Let's see it.
105,ep145,Okay. open.
106,ep145,"Living, dining, directly into a gigantic garden."
107,ep145,"Oh, my goodness, look at that garden."
108,ep145,I can't focus in on the garden right now because I just can't stop but help...
109,ep145,"Well, this is a living-dining situation and it's just not large enough for, you know, a family."
110,ep145,I think it's big enough.
111,ep145,"I mean, this staging and furniture is the wrong scale and it's set up wrong and they got this big chair shoved up -against the wall."
112,ep145,It's too big.
113,ep145,-It's Texas-sized furniture.
114,ep145,-You could do a nice...
115,ep145,"Yeah, you could do a nice sectional here."
116,ep145,You got the TV over here.
117,ep145,It still feels small and cramped to me.
118,ep145,"I mean, don't get me wrong, it's okay but it's not great."
119,ep145,Let's see what's not cramped.
120,ep145,Look at that.
121,ep145,"Well, this is not cramped at all."
122,ep145,Wow. is amazing.
123,ep145,This is a lot of good space to work with.
124,ep145,"We could even expand, like, look at that."
125,ep145,You could add this all into the house and you still have a huge back yard.
126,ep145,I don't like that we're talking about projects already though.
127,ep145,"But the value is there, right?"
128,ep145,The house is one-six.
129,ep145,It's been sitting for six months.
130,ep145,You wanna do renovations?
131,ep145,We need to really take some money off of the asking price.
132,ep145,Sometimes even sellers overshoot the market value.
133,ep145,"In this case, the house has been listed for more than six months."
134,ep145,My suggestion is to take at least 15% off and come in around a million four.
135,ep145,You're already talking about doing a bump-out which is a work that could take up to a year.
136,ep145,We gotta find something.
137,ep145,"Our last house, we got that house for a lot less than the asking price and that let us spend it on the renovation and make a good deal."
138,ep145,I see a lot of potential.
139,ep145,"In the 1950s, kitchens were obviously smaller."
140,ep145,"Oh, John, it's an electric stove."
141,ep145,But there's a gas line in the house.
142,ep145,So there is a way to run gas to this.
143,ep145,And I suspect that this is not a load-bearing wall.
144,ep145,You could switch this to be an island.
145,ep145,We already are considering a bump-out of the home.
146,ep145,We're already a considering a kitchen gut.
147,ep145,You're taking it all off the price.
148,ep145,"Yeah, but John's gonna get it for one and a quarter."
149,ep145,Okay. fine but we're just gonna also...
150,ep145,We're also gonna put another year into this renovation.
151,ep145,Just analytical side is obviously getting the best of him right now.
152,ep145,I need to keep him focused on the lack of room and the amount of time that the house will need for us to renovate.
153,ep145,Both bedrooms are about the same size.
154,ep145,"The bedrooms are really, really modest."
155,ep145,-And when I say modest...
156,ep145,They are small.
157,ep145,...I small.
158,ep145,You can choose which room you want for yours.
159,ep145,You might choose this room for yours because this is the only access to the top floor.
160,ep145,I don't know that I want the only access to the third floor to be through a bedroom.
161,ep145,Big bathroom.
162,ep145,You have to share.
163,ep145,This is actually a decent size bathroom.
164,ep145,I don't know why they did...
165,ep145,You could've done two vanities here.
166,ep145,This is all getting gutted.
167,ep145,It's a nice little space.
168,ep145,I think this is a beautiful music room.
169,ep145,It's a good space but it's not grand.
170,ep145,I've got a lot of vinyl records.
171,ep145,I'm just trying to figure out where we can put them.
172,ep145,Might put a...
173,ep145,Might put a tile floor in there.
174,ep145,Carpet in the bathroom.
175,ep145,That's just...
176,ep145,That's fantastic.
177,ep145,I appreciate what they're doing with the space but this is not really not that much of a functioning bathroom.
178,ep145,Are we in Paris?
179,ep145,Feels like a bed and breakfast.
180,ep145,[Jeff laughs]
181,ep145,"I'm very concerned that the house does not have enough room for the office, and music room, and the place to grow our future family."
182,ep145,What about the garage?
183,ep145,You could take away the garage and that could become a home office.
184,ep145,We have our office.
185,ep145,That's another project.
186,ep145,This could be a guest room office.
187,ep145,"If this is your office or au pair room, then I don't have a parking garage."
188,ep145,There's a parking pad.
189,ep145,[techno music playing]
190,ep145,I like the opportunity here.
191,ep145,"It really doesn't have three bedrooms in my mind yet but there's the potential there, and we can get it at a good price."
192,ep145,"You know, I think this could be a great home for our family."
193,ep145,There's just way too much repairs and what family?
194,ep145,"By the time we're done with this, I'm too old to have a kid."
195,ep145,"I think if we just went a little bit out of DC, you could get everything that Daniel wants."
196,ep145,We could get you in a price point that you really like.
197,ep145,You just sacrifice a little on the location.
198,ep145,I'd look a little farther out but it better really wow me.
199,ep145,[upbeat music playing]
200,ep145,I'm very eager to see this house.
201,ep145,I know John said he was gonna have to get creative on ideas but we're crossing the river into Virginia.
202,ep145,I don't know how that's gonna work.
203,ep145,"After selling their home in DC for a decent profit, Jeff and Daniel are hoping to upgrade to a bigger place where they can raise a family."
204,ep145,"But with the lease back on their old place about to end, they're running out of time."
205,ep145,"Today, their brokers brought them outside the city to Arlington, Virginia to see a house with more room to grow."
206,ep145,[upbeat music playing]
207,ep145,That was a quick and easy access to the garage and the driveway.
208,ep145,"I mean, after a 30-minute drive out from the city."
209,ep145,It's a handsome colonial.
210,ep145,It's actually quite large.
211,ep145,You've made it.
212,ep145,So it wasn't that hard to cross the Potomac.
213,ep145,Not for me.
214,ep145,That was a pretty stressful journey.
215,ep145,Huh? I'm walking into a wall.
216,ep145,You're walking into a very grand foyer with a tall ceiling.
217,ep145,Two stories.
218,ep145,What is this random balcony?
219,ep145,It's a walkway to nowhere.
220,ep145,So what purpose does it serve?
221,ep145,There's a lot of light coming in there.
222,ep145,That's nice.
223,ep145,I wanna be wowed when I walk into a house like this.
224,ep145,And I see this great staircase but then it would've been better if it just came straight down because you took up all this space and I don't know if that was a good use of space.
225,ep145,I do.
226,ep145,I think it's great because the last thing I want is basically feeling like claustrophobic when you're going up the stairs.
227,ep145,Someday our kid is gonna come down for their prom and graduation...
228,ep145,"Oh, it'll be a perfect lineup."
229,ep145,But I don't know if there's room for me to actually get a picture of them because there's not enough room to go back.
230,ep145,They've got a camera for that and we'll lose a few pounds and it'll be a grand space.
231,ep145,"As soon as I walked through the front door, I felt like I'm at home and it's a grand home."
232,ep145,"But as soon as Jeff walks in the front door, he was the polar opposite."
233,ep145,I think it was because it's in the suburbs.
234,ep145,A large living room with fireplace.
235,ep145,A family room and a dining room on the same level.
236,ep145,This seems small for a living room.
237,ep145,"No, actually, I like..."
238,ep145,"For a 5,000-square-foot house."
239,ep145,"No, it's not actually."
240,ep145,It's a good...
241,ep145,"Look, they put in a big piano in here."
242,ep145,The living room goes in to a nice family room.
243,ep145,"Wow, it's a big space."
244,ep145,Wood-burning fireplace.
245,ep145,And it's like you've gone from this supposed to be grand formal room with all this molding into some rustic country house.
246,ep145,-It doesn't make any sense.
247,ep145,"-Well, it's a..."
248,ep145,There are a lot of elements to this house where it seems like they tried to add grandeur or character but they were almost trying too hard.
249,ep145,I think this garden would be a great spot -for Lucy.
250,ep145,I agree.
251,ep145,It's a nice big back yard.
252,ep145,"However, on the other side, we get to see all of our neighbors."
253,ep145,There's no privacy here.
254,ep145,It is a big yard and big space.
255,ep145,And it can be a nice recreational space for Lucy.
256,ep145,"Well, it has updated appliances."
257,ep145,-That's nice.
258,ep145,Look at the view.
259,ep145,You've got a huge table space kitchen.
260,ep145,You could have six people at your breakfast table.
261,ep145,You've got good storage space.
262,ep145,Have you seen this door?
263,ep145,It's incredible.
264,ep145,-Huh? is nice.
265,ep145,I do like the Dutch door.
266,ep145,We have one of those when I was growing up.
267,ep145,So we get to take this grand staircase up to see nice large bedrooms.
268,ep145,And one of these could also double as the music room or the home office.
269,ep145,"Well, this one's a little bigger than the others."
270,ep145,That's nice.
271,ep145,Big walk-in closet.
272,ep145,What's this down here?
273,ep145,"Oh, so that's the access point?"
274,ep145,Huh. how you'd get up there to clean it.
275,ep145,"So wait, wait, what is this?"
276,ep145,Is this like where you put your DJ or your trio of violinists or what have you?
277,ep145,You can throw party favors down at the guests as they enter.
278,ep145,So this is the owner suite?
279,ep145,Yeah. I think you could easily fit a king-sized bed.
280,ep145,"Bathroom, you got your whirlpool tub."
281,ep145,Oh. my goodness.
282,ep145,"Oh, dear."
283,ep145,Welcome to the '70s.
284,ep145,"Yeah, this is definitely gut in here."
285,ep145,But you know what?
286,ep145,"It does, once again, have all the space, all the plumbing."
287,ep145,"And, you know, it's a good-sized room."
288,ep145,"And this could be, it's either a play space, it could be the home office, it could be the music room too."
289,ep145,You might choose different paint colors.
290,ep145,"Oh, wow."
291,ep145,"You just need to do a real quick refresh, like I even channeled the wall this morning when I dressed."
292,ep145,"All of a sudden, renovations are easy -and real quick."
293,ep145,You are the world.
294,ep145,You know what?
295,ep145,I'm just gonna...
296,ep145,"I'm just gonna blend into this wall, -so I could escape..."
297,ep145,Don't mind you.
298,ep145,...from negative comments.
299,ep145,I really think that we should seriously consider this house and think about just all the rooms it has to offer and the flexibility of the house for our future family to grow into.
300,ep145,But we don't need this much space.
301,ep145,"If we can get a third or a half of that space in Georgetown, I'd much rather take our investment there."
302,ep145,[upbeat music playing]
303,ep145,So John quickly finds them a place in the city and it's got the size Daniel wants.
304,ep145,But to get both those things means some major trade-offs.
305,ep145,"Oh, wow."
306,ep145,A little water damage.
307,ep145,A little?
308,ep145,[theme music playing]
309,ep145,I am a little bit stressed.
310,ep145,"You know, we gotta hurry it up."
311,ep145,-I mean...
312,ep145,"-Yeah, we're gonna..."
313,ep145,"If we don't get something next week, probably we need to just find something to rent."
314,ep145,Do they have parking?
315,ep145,It doesn't look like it has parking.
316,ep145,We saw this listed but it was like two-five.
317,ep145,They dropped it to two.
318,ep145,It's a big price reduction.
319,ep145,That is a big price reduction.
320,ep145,I wonder how much work it needs.
321,ep145,It's already more than I want to spend.
322,ep145,-Look at that.
323,ep145,What a big block.
324,ep145,It is a tall Victorian.
325,ep145,Looks like it's seen better days though.
326,ep145,It needs a little TLC.
327,ep145,"-Oh, yeah."
328,ep145,"-Well, that's a nice door."
329,ep145,"Yeah, nice door."
330,ep145,"Hey, there you are."
331,ep145,-Hey. needs a little work but it has so much potential.
332,ep145,I love the tail ceilings.
333,ep145,"Um, I just don't want..."
334,ep145,It's got very tall ceilings.
335,ep145,I just wish there weren't as many cracks.
336,ep145,-Wow. at that crown molding.
337,ep145,This is spectacular.
338,ep145,You get a nice entrance hall kind of a foyer.
339,ep145,"Living room, dining room."
340,ep145,Do the mirrors convey?
341,ep145,"Um, I think if they're here, they're staying."
342,ep145,So I guess this is like a living room?
343,ep145,This would be your living room.
344,ep145,Kind of east-facing here so you get nice morning light.
345,ep145,Look at the molding.
346,ep145,"Wow. at these French doors, though."
347,ep145,Those are really cool.
348,ep145,This is a nice sized room.
349,ep145,"Yeah. you got a dining room, the kitchen could use a little..."
350,ep145,"Oh, my God, John."
351,ep145,"...TLC. having like a flashback to 1980s, my childhood memories from the '80s."
352,ep145,"This is a lot of work, John."
353,ep145,We have to rip all this out.
354,ep145,Check out the garden.
355,ep145,That's a small-looking garden.
356,ep145,Just not enough room for Lucy to play around in.
357,ep145,You are across the street from a park.
358,ep145,We'll check out upstairs.
359,ep145,Is this the primary bedroom or...
360,ep145,Yes. there's not an en suite.
361,ep145,No. fireplace.
362,ep145,There's very little closet.
363,ep145,And there's an amazing view of the park.
364,ep145,"This is actually quite neat, the architecture and the steps."
365,ep145,"Oh, wow."
366,ep145,Nice. got another guest bedroom with bath here.
367,ep145,It's a very tiny bathroom though.
368,ep145,This is a nice room.
369,ep145,This would be a good kids' room.
370,ep145,"Well, I think you're gonna find your office and music room up here."
371,ep145,"Oh, this is nice."
372,ep145,With a fireplace.
373,ep145,A new flue.
374,ep145,"-Oh, another fireplace."
375,ep145,"Yeah, this one looks like it's been relined."
376,ep145,"I mean, I could see putting the desk here and we could just look out at the park over there."
377,ep145,What is that?
378,ep145,"Oh, wow."
379,ep145,Little water damage.
380,ep145,A little?
381,ep145,I love and appreciate historic homes.
382,ep145,"And yes, I expect to spend some money and to fix things."
383,ep145,And so this is the stressful part.
384,ep145,We have to purchase a home.
385,ep145,We have to get the home ready.
386,ep145,And so my concern with this house is that we would have to spend weeks prepping it for us to move in to this home.
387,ep145,Spiral stairs always sound...
388,ep145,Look at the height ...fun.
389,ep145,"Oh, wow!"
390,ep145,"Well, there's definitely a lot of privacy."
391,ep145,I can blast my music as loud as I need to.
392,ep145,"If we're gonna have kids though, -this is gonna be very dangerous."
393,ep145,Yeah. Lucy is definitely not gonna be able to bother you in your music room.
394,ep145,I think you could create a more normal staircase at some point.
395,ep145,"I mean, this house has a lot of wows."
396,ep145,"A lot of wows in terms of the potential, the beauty, the history, and then also like the project."
397,ep145,"The low-end spending 200,000 on renovating this house."
398,ep145,It is a project.
399,ep145,A project with a big payoff.
400,ep145,"Well, whatever we're gonna do, we need to do it soon because..."
401,ep145,-we're coming up on...
402,ep145,Yeah. to be out of the old house.
403,ep145,You have to move.
404,ep145,[techno music playing]
405,ep145,I never thought that we would be here with days to go and without a home.
406,ep145,Jeff and Daniel's opposite personalities have slowed down their hunt for a new home in the DC area.
407,ep145,Now they have to decide whether to spend big or go for a deal.
408,ep145,"So the federal style house in the heart of Georgetown, it had a whole lot of potential."
409,ep145,I think that garage would convert into a great office for me.
410,ep145,I can definitely make the top loft work for my music room.
411,ep145,And it's got a nice big back yard for Lucy.
412,ep145,All those are really good selling points.
413,ep145,But it's in an alleyway.
414,ep145,But that house has been sitting around for a long time.
415,ep145,That tells me there's a deal to be had.
416,ep145,The price is good.
417,ep145,"However, there's not room for a nanny or family to visit."
418,ep145,We can add the space.
419,ep145,"And when we're done with it, it's gonna be wow."
420,ep145,"I know that you didn't really like it as much as I did but the large suburban home in Arlington, I really loved the grand foyer."
421,ep145,That foyer was not a big space and it felt like it was trying too hard.
422,ep145,But that back yard and just the rooms in that home...
423,ep145,I can see the value.
424,ep145,There's so much space to work with.
425,ep145,"The house is 5,000 square feet."
426,ep145,There is that big Victorian Georgetown near the park.
427,ep145,I love a grand Victorian.
428,ep145,"It's a majestic, unique home."
429,ep145,It gives us a lot of rooms to work with.
430,ep145,You're right.
431,ep145,And you can have an amazing music room.
432,ep145,I can have a great office.
433,ep145,But I am concerned about the price.
434,ep145,I really wanna be closer to one-five if we're gonna have to do renovations.
435,ep145,And it does have a lot of projects.
436,ep145,The kitchen is a gut job.
437,ep145,"And plus, no parking."
438,ep145,And the backyard space just won't work for Lucy.
439,ep145,That is true.
440,ep145,I'm really stressed now.
441,ep145,[upbeat music playing]
442,ep145,Come on.
443,ep145,"It was a tough decision but at the end of the day, we chose the grand Victorian and we couldn't be happier."
444,ep145,And I am so relieved that our search is over.
445,ep145,"You like it, Luce?"
446,ep145,You got your dog bed.
447,ep145,This house with so many rooms and square footage offered us everything we're looking for.
448,ep145,It just feels fantastic to be living in such a grand Victorian.
449,ep145,"I mean, like how awesome is that?"
450,ep145,"We were concerned about the price but the benefit of working with a great agent is, he actually got us a house for under asking."
451,ep145,We had to beat out other potential buyers.
452,ep145,"So we knew that we had to act quick, so we made an offer."
453,ep145,This is a fantastic space.
454,ep145,"We had the home inspector come out and it turns out, the roof is in great shape."
455,ep145,They just didn't fix the cosmetic water damage.
456,ep145,"You know, the nice thing about this house is we can update it over time."
457,ep145,We don't have to do it all at once.
458,ep145,We're gonna start with the kitchen.
459,ep145,This is a 30-inch range.
460,ep145,We might wanna push it out to 36.
461,ep145,I'm very happy with my music room.
462,ep145,It's actually double the size of my old music room.
463,ep145,"While I didn't get my parking pad, however, I haven't had one day where I didn't find parking in front of the house."
464,ep145,"And we're right across the street from the park, which makes up for the fact that we didn't quite get the back yard of Daniel or Lucy's dreams."
465,ep145,Lucy. definitely a lot of stress and frustration but I think this was a fun process for us to imagine ourselves in all these different homes and think would it work for our family?
466,ep145,"You know, the crib will fit great over here."
467,ep145,We look forward to our future.
468,ep145,The sky's the limit.
1,ep146,Whoa. is so awesome.
2,ep146,It is so gorgeous.
3,ep146,"Katy and Kim are looking to trade up to an attractive and spacious home in Livermore, California."
4,ep146,Katy is prioritizing space on the inside.
5,ep146,"-Oh, this is beautiful."
6,ep146,-Right? really perfect for a family of seven.
7,ep146,Oh wait.
8,ep146,There's only three of us for now.
9,ep146,I don't care.
10,ep146,Kim is all about the amount of land they can get.
11,ep146,You can have cows.
12,ep146,You can have sheep.
13,ep146,You can have a variety of different things.
14,ep146,"Oh, great."
15,ep146,"Don't give her any ideas, Gina."
16,ep146,"But given the major lack of inventory in this area, getting any house will involve some big compromises."
17,ep146,It... as is though.
18,ep146,There's not gonna be...
19,ep146,-None of this will be done?
20,ep146,Right. this would be unfinished.
21,ep146,This is making me a little anxious.
22,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
23,ep146,-Coming in hot.
24,ep146,-Coming in hot.
25,ep146,I'm a captain with our local fire department.
26,ep146,I'm an engineer with our local fire department.
27,ep146,We met when we were pretty young.
28,ep146,Kim was 21.
29,ep146,I was 23.
30,ep146,"I saw Kim and I was like, ""Wow."
31,ep146,"Like I really gotta talk to her."""
32,ep146,I really liked her.
33,ep146,Our first sort of date was she invited me to 4th of July at her family's house.
34,ep146,"I walked in and it's like aunts, uncles, grandma."
35,ep146,"Like, ""Oh, good."
36,ep146,"We're meeting the whole family on our first date."""
37,ep146,"Hey, when you see something good, you gotta get it off the market quick."
38,ep146,-Here. up in there?
39,ep146,We've been married about five years.
40,ep146,"And we have a three-and-half-year-old son, Lukas."
41,ep146,How many eggs you got?
42,ep146,-One. one.
43,ep146,"We currently live in Livermore, California."
44,ep146,We bought this house 10 years ago.
45,ep146,But this house wasn't the house.
46,ep146,"It wasn't, you know, ""Oh, this is exactly what we've been looking for."""
47,ep146,We've always wanted a bigger home.
48,ep146,We always wanted property.
49,ep146,And we do wanna extend our family.
50,ep146,"And so we kind of start looking now, which isn't the ideal time because real estate market is really hot right now."
51,ep146,"I think one of the reasons that the market has been so hot in Livermore is our proximity to the Bay Area and also to Silicon Valley and to, you know, a lot of the tech industry."
52,ep146,We need to sit down and talk about how much we're comfortable paying and...
53,ep146,We're pre-approved for that $1.5
54,ep146,million. that's like...
55,ep146,That's our max.
56,ep146,We've always lived so far within our means that this is gonna be an adjustment.
57,ep146,"We've always been really good with our money, and that's what the money's for."
58,ep146,It's for a house and for our future.
59,ep146,"Currently, we're approved for $1.5"
60,ep146,million. are able to do that because we just have always saved.
61,ep146,And we live frugally.
62,ep146,Like Lukas always wears secondhand clothes.
63,ep146,We bought both of our vehicles secondhand.
64,ep146,I would love a bigger kitchen.
65,ep146,Like more user-friendly.
66,ep146,I'd love to be able to host and have people over.
67,ep146,"Hmm, user-friendly."
68,ep146,User-friendly. a bigger space.
69,ep146,"Like something where it's like better laid out cabinets, you know, just updated kitchen."
70,ep146,-Absolutely. walk-in pantry?
71,ep146,Walk-in pantry would be...
72,ep146,It would be amazing.
73,ep146,I would live in a walk-in pantry.
74,ep146,I offered to make that walk-in pantry.
75,ep146,Bless her heart.
76,ep146,She's a...
77,ep146,She's a 70/30.
78,ep146,She does 70% of the project.
79,ep146,She gets it done and it looks great.
80,ep146,And then the 30% kind of falls off.
81,ep146,"I'm more move-in ready at this point, 'cause I'm one of those people that's like I wanna start."
82,ep146,I wanna finish.
83,ep146,I want it to be done.
84,ep146,"Like, I want it off my plate."
85,ep146,And Kim's like got a list.
86,ep146,Why has that been on your list for a year?
87,ep146,"""Well, I still I'm gonna get to it."""
88,ep146,"I'm like, ""Get to it today, sister."
89,ep146,"Like, just get it done."""
90,ep146,"I'd really love a two-story house, but it's more farmhouse-y and less modernistic."
91,ep146,I like a ranch-style home.
92,ep146,That's kind of what...
93,ep146,It's what I grew up on.
94,ep146,I like open floor plans.
95,ep146,Things that just flow.
96,ep146,And going up and down stairs is just not my jam.
97,ep146,"And, you know, I would just really like to be able to, you know, live close to town and live close to friends and family."
98,ep146,And Kim would like to keep her horse on their property and no longer board it.
99,ep146,"From the beginning, like we've had different goals."
100,ep146,I'm a horse person.
101,ep146,I want acreage.
102,ep146,It's something that I have definitely been wanting ever since I was in high school.
103,ep146,I used to draw the lot.
104,ep146,This is where the tack room went and this is where the coral went.
105,ep146,I'm more than happy to drive up twisty mountain road if it means that I can have acres and not see my neighbors.
106,ep146,"Oh, God."
107,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
108,ep146,Look how beautiful it is.
109,ep146,-It's beautiful.
110,ep146,How long...
111,ep146,"Like, I literally just saw like a hawk sitting in a tree."
112,ep146,People go on vacation in places like this and then dream about buying a house out here.
113,ep146,-Some people do.
114,ep146,-I dream about being able to take Lu to school and not waste half a day.
115,ep146,And I think it's only like 15 minutes -to his daycare.
116,ep146,-Hmm. just saying.
117,ep146,-I think this is it.
118,ep146,-Is it coming up?
119,ep146,Yeah. up here on the left.
120,ep146,Okay. it's cute.
121,ep146,I like it.
122,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
123,ep146,"Oh, I see a horse."
124,ep146,It's really pretty out here.
125,ep146,I like the coloring.
126,ep146,Single-story. looks...
127,ep146,This looks incredible.
128,ep146,"Hi. up, Gina?"
129,ep146,How are you?
130,ep146,Nice drive out here.
131,ep146,-I know.
132,ep146,"It's just off the beaten path, so..."
133,ep146,-Just off the beaten path.
134,ep146,"-Oh, come on."
135,ep146,Just... an acre and a half.
136,ep146,So the size is right where you'd be looking.
137,ep146,"The location, a little bit further out but..."
138,ep146,Not terrible.
139,ep146,I think it is a challenge because there's not many homes that are coming on the market with this kind of acreage.
140,ep146,Livermore's got the best value for its money with the land that you get.
141,ep146,"I think a lot of folks are realizing that, and it's definitely brought a lot of competition."
142,ep146,I feel like this house could be a really good mix for them.
143,ep146,"For Kim, it offers the acreage that she's looking for."
144,ep146,"But for Katy, it does offer a lot with regard to it being move-in ready."
145,ep146,There's not anything really for them to do.
146,ep146,"Oh, I love these floors."
147,ep146,"Oh, this is nice."
148,ep146,Two-story. and a half.
149,ep146,The main bedroom is upstairs.
150,ep146,"Oh, okay."
151,ep146,Yeah. right.
152,ep146,It's a compromise.
153,ep146,So we've got the office.
154,ep146,You talked about having friends and family over.
155,ep146,This would be a great place.
156,ep146,So this doesn't count as one of the bedrooms?
157,ep146,-This is...
158,ep146,It does.
159,ep146,"-Oh, okay."
160,ep146,Got it.
161,ep146,So there are two downstairs and then we have the main upstairs.
162,ep146,I like it being downstairs.
163,ep146,"And it has a bathroom like really close by, so it's not like you have to walk, you know, through the whole house to get there."
164,ep146,And this is great.
165,ep146,It's got the modern look.
166,ep146,-[Kim and Katy]
167,ep146,Yeah. totally -our style too.
168,ep146,Like... know.
169,ep146,It really is.
170,ep146,...kind rustic-y and farmhouse and...
171,ep146,I think so.
172,ep146,"Oh, I love the open floor plan."
173,ep146,This is beautiful.
174,ep146,"I mean, the beams are amazing."
175,ep146,Whoa. is so awesome.
176,ep146,I think those are gorgeous.
177,ep146,I like how open the house feels and inviting.
178,ep146,It feels like coming home.
179,ep146,"When they said open floor, they mean open floor."
180,ep146,"-I can do my laundry, watch TV, and..."
181,ep146,You can.
182,ep146,You could potentially close this in or you could just make it like...
183,ep146,-There's a project for you.
184,ep146,-Perfect. project.
185,ep146,-Close it in.
186,ep146,Yeah. tiny project.
187,ep146,Absolutely. we have a bedroom over here.
188,ep146,This would be potentially a room for Lu.
189,ep146,This is like...
190,ep146,It's the gym.
191,ep146,Kind of far from my room.
192,ep146,Yeah. kind of...
193,ep146,It's a little far from our room even with our little security camera we got on him.
194,ep146,For his age.
195,ep146,"For a three-year-old, yeah."
196,ep146,When he's a little older then he wants to sneak out.
197,ep146,Then he'll wanna be down here.
198,ep146,-Then... big.
199,ep146,"So carpet, nice."
200,ep146,Okay. it a little warmer.
201,ep146,And it's nice because it opens to this loft area.
202,ep146,Woo. my gosh.
203,ep146,It does make you feel kind of like you're in charge.
204,ep146,Like you're gonna call your battles.
205,ep146,Wow. is like a suite.
206,ep146,"Now, I can see Lu wanting to be up here."
207,ep146,Yeah. doubt.
208,ep146,It's got some character with the vaulted ceilings.
209,ep146,Aggressively vaulted.
210,ep146,That's aggressively vaulted.
211,ep146,"It's like the perfect height for you, babe."
212,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
213,ep146,"Ooh. oh, look at that view."
214,ep146,And it has a pantry.
215,ep146,"Yeah. mean, I'm more of a walk-in pantry."
216,ep146,There's kind of some sliders.
217,ep146,I really wanna be able to hide in there and snack.
218,ep146,The geography of the pantry is important.
219,ep146,-Got it.
220,ep146,-It is.
221,ep146,It's really important.
222,ep146,"Oh, wow."
223,ep146,This is beautiful.
224,ep146,There's plenty of room.
225,ep146,"I mean, you've got this whole section over here."
226,ep146,-That is staying.
227,ep146,And that's...
228,ep146,That's all staying?
229,ep146,...primarily looks like we're able to keep horses here.
230,ep146,Absolutely. do know that the property line goes to the oak tree and then past that is a creek.
231,ep146,That's beautiful.
232,ep146,"I mean, it is."
233,ep146,It is beautiful.
234,ep146,This is a beautiful piece of property.
235,ep146,It's a little far out.
236,ep146,"I'm not gonna lie, but..."
237,ep146,"Well, it's not that far."
238,ep146,"I will say, in today's market, it's really, really competitive."
239,ep146,"And even at this price point, we're seeing multiple offers 'cause land is hard to come by."
240,ep146,The land is really nice.
241,ep146,It feels very isolated -but in a good way.
242,ep146,It's pretty far out.
243,ep146,In the middle of nowhere.
244,ep146,My cellphone doesn't even work.
245,ep146,"So even if was gonna call for help, I couldn't."
246,ep146,So now their agent's found a place that's less isolated for Katy but they'll have to be flexible on condition.
247,ep146,It's undergoing some renovations right now.
248,ep146,I think like the whole downstairs.
249,ep146,"Oh, wow."
250,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
251,ep146,I still like the time I went to go check on your horse and...
252,ep146,You sent me a picture of the wrong one.
253,ep146,"Firefighters Kim and Katy are having a hard time finding a big house with enough room for Kim's horses in their pricey city near Silicon Valley, California."
254,ep146,They're in luck today since a property owner who was renovating her place to rent it out has decided to sell it instead.
255,ep146,Kim and Katy can see it now in its unfinished state with a promise that the main rooms will be finished up by the seller's contractor.
256,ep146,I'm a little bit worried just because it's our max price and it's undergoing some renovations right now.
257,ep146,I think like the whole downstairs.
258,ep146,"Oh, wow."
259,ep146,There's not a lot of homes that go for sale in this area so we wanna be able to move quickly.
260,ep146,The good news is the downstairs will be completely finished so their livable space -will be ready to go.
261,ep146,Is this it?
262,ep146,Yeah. think this is it.
263,ep146,That is gorgeous.
264,ep146,"I mean, it's two-story but it's..."
265,ep146,Wow. see a pasture.
266,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
267,ep146,Close to downtown.
268,ep146,I love it.
269,ep146,Yeah. looks like they had horses here.
270,ep146,"Definitely. two different areas, so you could actually have..."
271,ep146,You can have cows.
272,ep146,You can have sheep.
273,ep146,You can have a variety of different things.
274,ep146,"Oh, great."
275,ep146,"Don't give her any ideas, Gina."
276,ep146,This place gives me a lot of things to like be excited and enthusiastic about.
277,ep146,The whole property is flat usable acres.
278,ep146,It also backs up to trails which is fantastic.
279,ep146,So this house has a little bit of the farmhouse.
280,ep146,Yeah. it is under construction.
281,ep146,How much is gonna be done or is this...
282,ep146,is this how we as is?
283,ep146,So they are gonna be finishing.
284,ep146,"They're gonna be finishing crown molding, the door hardware, and last-minute touches and then this room will be complete."
285,ep146,That's fantastic.
286,ep146,I love the open concept.
287,ep146,The bar over there.
288,ep146,Yeah. could put the bar over there and just get a big farmhouse table right there.
289,ep146,"Yeah. of course, -the kitchen is all new."
290,ep146,It has a pantry.
291,ep146,Yes. walk-in pantry.
292,ep146,"Oh, that's awesome."
293,ep146,So all this will be finished?
294,ep146,So that's a little concerning for me.
295,ep146,"Like we're not just buying this as is down here, right?"
296,ep146,"No. when it is ready, there will be actually cabinets up top."
297,ep146,There's gonna be door and drawer fronts.
298,ep146,It's looking good.
299,ep146,"I mean, I do like the floating shelves and the subway tile."
300,ep146,I really like how they laid out this area.
301,ep146,So we're gonna move to the back portion of the house.
302,ep146,It's not finished and they're not planning on finishing it.
303,ep146,Okay. think this room is really cool.
304,ep146,I love the natural light and the beams and the fireplace.
305,ep146,It's as is though?
306,ep146,There's not gonna be...
307,ep146,-None of this will be done?
308,ep146,Right. this would be unfinished.
309,ep146,"I mean, it's not that hard."
310,ep146,You can do flooring baseboards.
311,ep146,It's not a big deal.
312,ep146,There is work to be done so I can understand the concern.
313,ep146,I think what's important for them to remember is that not many homes come on the market in this area.
314,ep146,I would take on the challenge and I would go full force.
315,ep146,This is almost like an extra living space.
316,ep146,Wow. is huge.
317,ep146,Right? really do like it.
318,ep146,It's just this house is like turning into a 70/30 project of 70% not being done and 30% being done.
319,ep146,This is making me a little anxious.
320,ep146,I'm not worried about the work.
321,ep146,I haven't seen anything so far that I can't do.
322,ep146,I'm just worried about finishing everything is sometimes the most expensive part.
323,ep146,"This is our max for our price, and so none of these remodels are gonna happen in the near future."
324,ep146,"But that has so much potential, and I'm gonna be excited to kind of take on and see what we can do with it."
325,ep146,-All right.
326,ep146,Two stories though.
327,ep146,-All right.
328,ep146,Are your thighs burning yet?
329,ep146,Hey. climb.
330,ep146,The climb.
331,ep146,Look at the view.
332,ep146,-Wow. beautiful.
333,ep146,Right? is amazing.
334,ep146,-I mean...
335,ep146,This is great because they opened up this wall.
336,ep146,If we have another kiddo then this would be like a perfect nursery.
337,ep146,Yeah. take a look at the main bathroom.
338,ep146,Awesome. right.
339,ep146,Okay. usable.
340,ep146,Yes. big and the layout's nice.
341,ep146,We've got another full bathroom in here.
342,ep146,-A little bit of updating.
343,ep146,Little bit.
344,ep146,"All the bathrooms at our current house, we've redone ninety-five to a hundred percent of the way."
345,ep146,Not just 70.
346,ep146,"Well, you were at 70 for a while with some of the bathrooms, so, you know..."
347,ep146,"Well, now they're at 90."
348,ep146,"So, again, another bedroom."
349,ep146,It's got a little nook here.
350,ep146,-And closet.
351,ep146,-This would be awesome for Lu's room.
352,ep146,"Yeah. the rooms are all ready to go, right?"
353,ep146,"The carpet, paint."
354,ep146,And nice-sized bedroom.
355,ep146,Yeah. Wow.
356,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
357,ep146,This would be a fantastic place to really host people.
358,ep146,"And I think, again, the land being flat and your horses, you can do all of that."
359,ep146,There's just a lot of little projects.
360,ep146,"And by little, I mean..."
361,ep146,"Big. might tend to disagree with you, because, again, this will all be finished and you'll have that backroom to do..."
362,ep146,Yeah. it's hard to visualize.
363,ep146,And there's the stuff that will be finished and the stuff that won't be finished.
364,ep146,I'm trying to parcel those out.
365,ep146,"And also justify the price point, -it's..."
366,ep146,-Yes. understand.
367,ep146,-It's a lot.
368,ep146,How much would remodel cost?
369,ep146,What would it look like?
370,ep146,What would the time commitment be?
371,ep146,It makes me a little nervous.
372,ep146,"To put Katy and Kim at ease, their agent's lined up an updated house at a lower price."
373,ep146,But... not sure.
374,ep146,I'm not sure.
375,ep146,I'm just trying to envision where the horse is gonna go.
376,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
377,ep146,These are gorgeous houses.
378,ep146,"This neighborhood just looks like our neighborhood, you know?"
379,ep146,"And I love our neighborhood, but, you know, we're looking for something different."
380,ep146,"Kim and Katy have lived frugally for years in order to be able to afford their dream house in pricey Livermore, California where even starter homes go for close to $1,000,000."
381,ep146,"Today they're seeing a place right in town, but it may not have room for Kim's horses."
382,ep146,What's the price tag for it?
383,ep146,I think it's $1.3
384,ep146,million. less than our cap.
385,ep146,-That's awesome.
386,ep146,Yeah. me how much land it's on.
387,ep146,-Ask me.
388,ep146,-How much land is it on?
389,ep146,.4 acres.
390,ep146,[makes sad trombone sound]
391,ep146,I just wanna live on 20 acres.
392,ep146,"But for now where we we're at, it's close to schools."
393,ep146,It's close to downtown.
394,ep146,Lukas is three.
395,ep146,Driving him to school is also a priority for us.
396,ep146,And that one just in the corner.
397,ep146,"Oh, wow."
398,ep146,That's nice.
399,ep146,I like it.
400,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
401,ep146,It looks nice.
402,ep146,-I'm chomping at the bit.
403,ep146,I know.
404,ep146,"Well, I like it."
405,ep146,I like the...
406,ep146,I like the stone.
407,ep146,-I like the brick.
408,ep146,I know.
409,ep146,"What's up, Gina?"
410,ep146,How are you?
411,ep146,Good. on in.
412,ep146,"Oh, wow."
413,ep146,Yeah. at this.
414,ep146,Wow. in one story.
415,ep146,"Ah, thank you."
416,ep146,The pool table gonna come?
417,ep146,It can.
418,ep146,Everything is negotiable.
419,ep146,It's got the step-down so a little bit more formal.
420,ep146,Specially with the fireplace and everything.
421,ep146,We have a formal fireplace.
422,ep146,-Formal fireplace.
423,ep146,Yes. cozy fireplace.
424,ep146,Yeah. three fireplaces in the house.
425,ep146,Really? perfect.
426,ep146,-I love how open it is.
427,ep146,Yes. I love the fireplace.
428,ep146,And then check this out.
429,ep146,The front room is gonna be where Lu hangs out and this can be where we hang out.
430,ep146,-I know.
431,ep146,Yeah. This is beautiful.
432,ep146,"-Oh, my gosh."
433,ep146,"Really pretty, right?"
434,ep146,Yeah. perfect for a family of seven.
435,ep146,"-Oh, wait."
436,ep146,-There's only three of us.
437,ep146,-I don't care.
438,ep146,"I... we entertain so much, it's just so nice that I can have so much space -to prep and everything."
439,ep146,It's got a walk-in pantry which is nice.
440,ep146,Oh. is perfect.
441,ep146,All right.
442,ep146,I think you'll be happy that not a lot of projects with this place.
443,ep146,"Oh, wow."
444,ep146,-[Kim laughs]
445,ep146,I'm not sure...
446,ep146,-I'm not sure where...
447,ep146,I'm not sure.
448,ep146,I'm just trying to envision where the horse is gonna go.
449,ep146,It's like a miniature horse.
450,ep146,A pony?
451,ep146,Like I'm gonna trade my horse in.
452,ep146,-Like a pony.
453,ep146,Like a little pony.
454,ep146,-Like a little pony.
455,ep146,-There's a side yard.
456,ep146,-There's a side yard.
457,ep146,-Or like a Great Dane.
458,ep146,It's a big trade-off to either find a house that has that kind of acreage and then put it in the potential work and upgrades to keep the horse on the property or they can kind of meet in the middle and they can have a house like this where they get all the space with all the updates and then they still keep Kim's horse boarded.
459,ep146,-Very nice sky light.
460,ep146,"Oh, nice."
461,ep146,Wow. did a great job.
462,ep146,They've made a lot of nice changes -so it's very contemporary.
463,ep146,"Yes. again, it's a really nicely-sized room."
464,ep146,"I mean, they have a huge bed in here."
465,ep146,Okay. then we have a second full bath.
466,ep146,So it's nice that you have the tub.
467,ep146,Yeah. like how they mirror each other too but they have the option of the bath tub.
468,ep146,And then here we have another two bedrooms.
469,ep146,"Oh, okay."
470,ep146,"Oh, it's giant."
471,ep146,They did a great job updating.
472,ep146,-No projects.
473,ep146,No projects.
474,ep146,I see...
475,ep146,I see no projects for you so far.
476,ep146,I see no horse for me so far.
477,ep146,-Whoa. Toledo.
478,ep146,I love it.
479,ep146,-This is beautiful.
480,ep146,-For what?
481,ep146,-For who?
482,ep146,For me to live in.
483,ep146,For our parents?
484,ep146,"Oh, my gosh."
485,ep146,This is beautiful.
486,ep146,Wait till we step inside.
487,ep146,"Oh, a standard shower and a tub."
488,ep146,I like the floor.
489,ep146,It's got this little sitting area.
490,ep146,Yeah. could do your make up.
491,ep146,-Twice a year.
492,ep146,Twice a year.
493,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
494,ep146,The kitchen is gorgeous.
495,ep146,The bedroom is gorgeous.
496,ep146,It's close to downtown.
497,ep146,"It's close to Lu's, you know, school."
498,ep146,-I really love it.
499,ep146,"-It's in a neighborhood that looks like the neighborhood we live in now, and it doesn't have..."
500,ep146,"I mean, functionally, it does not have enough space in the backyard for a horse."
501,ep146,The reason that we wanted to move was get a bigger house but mostly a bigger piece of property.
502,ep146,And I'm just worried that it doesn't really satisfy that as much.
503,ep146,"It does satisfy like 90% of everything else, so..."
504,ep146,Like 70% of everything else.
505,ep146,"Well, I think if you can get to 80%, you're there."
506,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
507,ep146,So what do you think?
508,ep146,-A lot to think about.
509,ep146,A lot.
510,ep146,"Firefighters Kim and Katy have saved for years to buy a big family home in competitive Livermore, California."
511,ep146,"But while Kim's holding out for acreage, Katy's more concerned about what's inside the house."
512,ep146,What about the story and a half and the 1.46
513,ep146,"acres? a horse property, and that's in the middle of nowhere."
514,ep146,It's literally 12 minutes from downtown.
515,ep146,Twelve minutes?
516,ep146,That's it.
517,ep146,Twelve minutes.
518,ep146,It's done.
519,ep146,It doesn't have any projects that need to get finished right now.
520,ep146,It has enough space.
521,ep146,"The layout, it's just not functional for us."
522,ep146,Lu has his own space.
523,ep146,The guest would have their own space.
524,ep146,He'd be so far away from us.
525,ep146,So what do you think of the farmhouse for $1.5
526,ep146,million? can totally have a horse like tomorrow.
527,ep146,I could move my horse in.
528,ep146,It's two-story.
529,ep146,We're not super far out.
530,ep146,It's close to downtown.
531,ep146,It has hiking trails.
532,ep146,There's wineries close by.
533,ep146,It's a construction zone.
534,ep146,My blood pressure was rising just walking through the door.
535,ep146,"But a lot of that is supposed to be done, right?"
536,ep146,But it's just...
537,ep146,There's just so much stuff to still be done even with the portions they said would be completed.
538,ep146,It's all the stuff that we could finish eventually as we have time and finances for it.
539,ep146,"I mean, I just keep going back to the..."
540,ep146,to the house that has...
541,ep146,That is done and it has everything we want.
542,ep146,It's so close to downtown and so close to downtown schools.
543,ep146,It's done.
544,ep146,It's finished.
545,ep146,It has a better layout.
546,ep146,The kitchen is spectacular.
547,ep146,"We can move in, and for where we are right now with work..."
548,ep146,I think it's just the most sensible thing for us.
549,ep146,"It's on the same piece of property we have now, basically."
550,ep146,-You're just not gonna...
551,ep146,-here's no barn over there.
552,ep146,[upbeat music playing]
553,ep146,[doorbell dings]
554,ep146,"Mommy, I wanna show you a trick first."
555,ep146,[Katy and Kim]
556,ep146,Okay. we ended up deciding on the farmhouse and a few projects that need to be finished.
557,ep146,-Just a few.
558,ep146,See? coming along.
559,ep146,"The walk-in ranch was really appealing to me just 'cause there wasn't a ton of projects, where this is just a little bit more daunting."
560,ep146,But I also see like it's a gorgeous house.
561,ep146,Kim gets the horse property she wants and I get to live closer to town.
562,ep146,And so it was a great compromise.
563,ep146,Lu loves the house.
564,ep146,He's decided that the house's name is Frank.
565,ep146,There he is.
566,ep146,-Got him.
567,ep146,-Got him.
568,ep146,We just closed last week but we're still under construction.
569,ep146,It made me very uneasy doing $1.5
570,ep146,"million, our max, with projects still pending."
571,ep146,The seller said the contractor that she had already hired would finish the kitchen.
572,ep146,"And then this whole area and then this like the family room, we're really hopeful that will be done soon."
573,ep146,So we are kind of holding off on moving stuff in till the contractor is done.
574,ep146,Upstairs is completely livable.
575,ep146,"It's just, like, the bathrooms could use some updating."
576,ep146,"And like the same thing with the bonus room, it needs finishing but we can finish them as we have time and finances."
577,ep146,"I'm someone who likes to do a project and finish it, but I also see like where Kim's vision is, and so this is something that I could just put my trust in her."
578,ep146,[make sounds]
579,ep146,"You... climb the hill, Lu?"
580,ep146,The two things that I'm looking forward to the most are moving my horse over like fulltime and then just seeing how Lu finds ways to play with things here.
581,ep146,I think it's a hundred percent worth it.
582,ep146,I wanna slide down.
583,ep146,You're gonna slide down?
584,ep146,"Oh, I am not doing that with my pants."

51,ep147,"GOOD MORNING, FINE, HERE..."
52,ep147,GLAD YOU'RE LOOKING.
53,ep147,WE'RE ANXIOUS TO GO IN.
54,ep147,GREAT. ON CONCENTRATE.
55,ep147,SO THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOR.
56,ep147,"REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU LOCATION IS EVERYTHING WHEN YOU'RE BUYING HOMES, AND THESE ARE THE AREAS CLOSE TO WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING HOME."
57,ep147,"(Jayne) KAREN ASKED US A LOT OF QUESTIONS THE FIRST TIME WE MET WITH HER, AND SHE ASKED FOR ALL THE THINGS WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN A HAPPY."
58,ep147,(Mitchell) SHE WANTS US TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE.
59,ep147,SHE SEEMS REAL WELL.
60,ep147,SHE KNOWS THE AREAS AND THE COMMUNITY REALLY ASK.
61,ep147,"SHE KNOWS THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND SO SHE'S REALLY OFFERED A LOT OF INFORMATION AND ADVICE THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN TO HERE."
62,ep147,WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HOMES HERE...
63,ep147,"YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE HOUSE HERE, HERE, HERE."
64,ep147,AND THEN ONE OVER STARTED.
65,ep147,(Mitchell) I CAN'T WAIT TO GET RANGE.
66,ep147,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, WE'LL HEAD OUT WITH MITCH AND JAYNE TO SEE WHAT'S ON THE MARKET IN THEIR PRICE MORE..."
67,ep147,WILL THE HOMES THEY CAN AFFORD BE ENTRY.
68,ep147,(Mitchell) I LIKE THE COURTYARD LESS....
69,ep147,OR KITCHEN.
70,ep147,(Jayne) IT'S A SMALL EXPECT...
71,ep147,THAN THEY TUNED.
72,ep147,STAY HUNTERS...
73,ep147,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE WHANG.
74,ep147,I'M SUZANNE BETTER.
75,ep147,"FOR JAYNE AND MITCHELL ENGLANDER, BIGGER IS DEFINITELY HOME."
76,ep147,"FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE COUPLE AND THEIR THREE- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER LINDSAY HAVE BEEN LEASING A MODEST TWO-BEDROOM GROW."
77,ep147,"THE HOME WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR THEIR FAMILY OF THREE, BUT WHEN THEY REALIZED THEY WERE ABOUT TO BECOME A FAMILY OF FOUR, THE ENGLANDERS STARTED THINKING ABOUT BUYING A NEW LARGER HOME, ONE THAT WOULD GIVE THEM ROOM TO HOMES."
78,ep147,(Mitchell) WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AND LOOKING AND LOOKING FOR MARKET.
79,ep147,"WE'VE PROBABLY LOOKED AT WELL OVER 40 OR 50 HOMES, AND THE CLOCK'S TICKING, SO WE'RE OUT THERE POUNDING THE PAVEMENT EVERY DAY, LOOKING AT EVERY HOME THAT COMES AVAILABLE ON THE DECISION."
80,ep147,(Jayne) I THINK I'M MORE EMOTIONAL IN MAKING THIS INVESTMENT?
81,ep147,"I'M LOOKING MORE AT THE AESTHETICS OF THE HOME, AND HE'S LOOKING AT MORE, IS THIS A GOOD HERE."
82,ep147,"(Karen) IT'S GOT WOOD FLOORS, BUT YOU'VE GOT WATER DAMAGE IS?"
83,ep147,THAT'S WHAT THAT DAMAGE.
84,ep147,"UH-HUH, THAT'S WATER THERE."
85,ep147,"COULD BE PET STAINS, COULD HAVE HAD A PLANT SEE."
86,ep147,"(Jayne) I'VE LIKED HOUSES, AND WE'VE HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM IT 'CAUSE HE AND THE REALTOR WILL SEE SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T REALLY IT."
87,ep147,(Karen) IT'S GOT A NICE SIZE TO UPDATING.
88,ep147,IT NEEDS SPACE.
89,ep147,"YOU DON'T HAVE A DISHWASHER HERE, AND YOU DON'T HAVE REALLY A LOT OF CUPBOARD CONDITION."
90,ep147,(Suzanne) ONE OF THE ENGLANDERS' PRIORITIES IS TO FIND A HOUSE THAT'S IN MOVE-IN FIXER-UPPER.
91,ep147,"MONEY IS TIGHT, AND THIS COUPLE WOULD PREFER TO PUT ALL OF THEIR SAVINGS TOWARD THEIR DOWNPAYMENT RATHER THAN SETTING ASIDE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MAKE REPAIRS AND RENOVATIONS ON A HOUSE."
92,ep147,LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE REST OF THIS GUYS?
93,ep147,"OKAY. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK, IMPROVEMENTS."
94,ep147,"IT'S A GOOD-SIZED ROOM, BUT IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK."
95,ep147,THE HOUSE NEEDS A LOT OF TO?
96,ep147,"EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN SO FAR NEEDS A LOT OF WORK, AND WITH THE BABY COMING, DON'T WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MOVE RIGHT IN PRICE."
97,ep147,(Mitchell) I THINK OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN FINDING OUR PERFECT HOME IS GOING TO BE TOUGH.
98,ep147,"WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND ALL THE AMENITIES IN A HOME AND A NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SOMETHING LESS, WHICH'LL BE EASY."
99,ep147,"(Suzanne) MITCH AND JAYNE MAY KNOW THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE SOME COMPROMISES, AND ACTUALLY DECIDING ON WHICH FEATURES THEY CAN LIVE WITHOUT ISN'T NERVOUS."
100,ep147,WE'RE PRETTY IN.
101,ep147,"WE'VE ONLY GIVEN OURSELVES ORIGINALLY 90 DAYS TO FIND A HOUSE, GET A LOAN, CLOSE ESCROW AND MOVE RISES."
102,ep147,"(Suzanne) AND WITH EVERY HOUSE THEY SEE, BUT DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH, THEIR FRUSTRATION LEVEL HOUSE."
103,ep147,IT'S A NICE NICE...
104,ep147,"(Mitchell) YEAH, THIS IS WINDOWS."
105,ep147,I LIKE ALL THE WORKING.
106,ep147,YEAH. DON'T THINK THE FIREPLACE IS REAL.
107,ep147,(Jayne) I DON'T THINK IT'S IN.
108,ep147,"YEAH, IT'S ALL BRICKED ROOM."
109,ep147,WE REALLY WANT A FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING WORK.
110,ep147,"WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THE REST OF THE HOUSE AND SEE IF IT'LL KITCHEN."
111,ep147,OKAY. IT'S A SMALL HERE.
112,ep147,"YEAH, THERE'S BARELY ROOM FOR THE THREE OF US HERE."
113,ep147,YOU CAN'T REALLY PUT A TABLE IN US.
114,ep147,NO. KITCHEN DOESN'T WORK FOR KITCHEN?
115,ep147,YOU DON'T LIKE THE KITCHEN.
116,ep147,I DON'T LIKE THE FIREPLACE.
117,ep147,AND THE HOUSE DOESN'T HAVE A TRUE...
118,ep147,"YEAH, THAT'S TRUE."
119,ep147,THAT'S IMPORTANT.
120,ep147,THE TWO BIG THINGS THAT ARE ONE.
121,ep147,LET'S GO LOOK FURTHER AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT HOUSE.
122,ep147,THIS IS A NICE NICE...
123,ep147,YEAH? TRADITIONAL.
124,ep147,NICE AND US.
125,ep147,NOT FOR BLEAK.
126,ep147,(Mitchell) THE AVAILABILITY'S BEEN REAL RANGE.
127,ep147,(Jayne) THERE'S NOT A LOT OUT THERE IN OUR PRICE BUDGETED.
128,ep147,(Mitchell) EITHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A SMALLER HOUSE OR SPEND A LITTLE MORE THAN WE HAVE ENTRY.
129,ep147,(Mitchell) I LIKE THE COURTYARD HOME.
130,ep147,THIS IS A REALLY NICE-LOOKING TRIM.
131,ep147,LOOK AT THE IT.
132,ep147,"OH, I LOVE CHARM."
133,ep147,IT'S GOT A LOT OF HONEY.
134,ep147,"YES. AT THE STAIRS, BABY."
135,ep147,THAT WILL BE REALLY HARD WITH THE TOO.
136,ep147,"(Mitchell) YEAH, THEY'RE PRETTY NARROW, STEEP."
137,ep147,VERY ROOM.
138,ep147,"OH, BUT LOOK AT THE LIVING SIZE..."
139,ep147,LOOK AT THE NICE.
140,ep147,IT'S REALLY ROOM.
141,ep147,"VERY NICE, IT'S A GREAT-SIZED LIVING FIREPLACE."
142,ep147,IT'S GOT A NICE.
143,ep147,"(Mitchell) YEAH, THIS IS VERY HOUSE?"
144,ep147,HOW OLD IS THE 1926.
145,ep147,IT WAS BUILT IN HOME.
146,ep147,"IT DOES HAVE FORCED-AIR HEATING, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE CENTRAL AIR AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU WANTED IN YOUR AIR."
147,ep147,YEAH. IT DOESN'T HAVE AIR.
148,ep147,"NO, NO CENTRAL ROOM."
149,ep147,"STAIRS AND NO AIR, BUT NICE LIVING HOUSE."
150,ep147,LET'S LOOK AT THE REST OF THE STAIRS.
151,ep147,(Jayne) THESE ARE REALLY STEEP HERE.
152,ep147,BE TOUGH TO GET OUR FURNITURE UP HERE.
153,ep147,(Mitchell) WE'LL NEVER GET OUR FURNITURE UP KIDS...
154,ep147,AND THE KNOW?
155,ep147,"WILL BE REALLY DANGEROUS, YOU STEEP."
156,ep147,"YEAH, THESE ARE REAL STEEP."
157,ep147,IT'S REALLY BATHROOM.
158,ep147,(Jayne) THAT'S A CUTE LITTLE LITTLE.
159,ep147,VERY TILE.
160,ep147,(Karen) ORIGINAL SINK.
161,ep147,"LOOK, THERE'S ONLY ONE HERE."
162,ep147,"YEAH, AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR TWO NOT."
163,ep147,THERE'S SINKS.
164,ep147,WE NEED TWO MIRRORS...
165,ep147,MM-HMM. AT THE NICE.
166,ep147,THAT'S REALLY NICE?
167,ep147,ISN'T THAT HOUSE.
168,ep147,"(Mitchell) YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE OUTDATED, THOUGH, SO WE NEED-- (Jayne) BUT IT GOES WITH THE DOES."
169,ep147,IT IT.
170,ep147,PART OF THE CHARACTER OF CRITICAL.
171,ep147,"OKAY. FOR MITCH AND JAYNE, THE OUTSIDE OF A HOUSE IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE INSIDE, AND THE BACKYARD IS THOUGH."
172,ep147,"THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THE KIDS TO PLAY, YEAH."
173,ep147,(Jayne) SET.
174,ep147,NOWHERE TO PUT A SWING BY.
175,ep147,I SEE A LOT OF CARS GOING SO...
176,ep147,"IT'S A BUSY STREET BACK THERE, HOUSE."
177,ep147,BUT IT'S A NICE IS.
178,ep147,IT FAR.
179,ep147,ONE OF THE NICER ONES WE'VE SEEN SO TOO.
180,ep147,"OKAY. LIKE THE SPANISH STYLE, TOO."
181,ep147,"I LIKE IT, ROOM."
182,ep147,I LIKE THE BEAMS IN THE LIVING TOO.
183,ep147,"I DO, BUT..."
184,ep147,"A LOT OF PLUSES, ME."
185,ep147,OKAY. JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR IT.
186,ep147,(Mitchell) I THINK WE'LL KNOW OUR HOUSE WHEN WE SEE IT.
187,ep147,"I HOPE WE'LL KNOW OUR HOUSE WHEN WE SEE IT, AND I KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, SO I THINK WHEN WE DO SEE IT, WE'LL SAY THIS IS DON'T."
188,ep147,I JUST PRAY THAT WE FIND A HOME WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IF WE FAMILY.
189,ep147,(Suzanne) THE CLOCK IS TICKING FOR THE ENGLANDER OUT?
190,ep147,CAN THEY FIND A HOME BEFORE THEIR TIME RUNS BIG.
191,ep147,THIS IS REALLY HON.
192,ep147,"LOOK AT THIS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUES."
193,ep147,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS HUNTERS...
194,ep147,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE WHANG.
195,ep147,I'M SUZANNE MONTHS.
196,ep147,JAYNE AND MITCH ENGLANDER HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING NEIGHBORHOODS AND TOURING HOUSES FOR OVER THREE FAMILY.
197,ep147,"THIS FAMILY OF THREE IS ABOUT TO BECOME A FAMILY OF FOUR, SO JAYNE AND MITCHELL ARE DEVOTING EVERY SPARE MOMENT TO THEIR SEARCH FOR A NEW AND LARGER HOME FOR THEIR BUDGET."
198,ep147,"SO FAR, THOUGH, THE FAMILY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A HOME THAT HAS EVERYTHING THEY WANT WITH A PRICE TAG THAT FITS THEIR HOMES."
199,ep147,"(Mitchell) WE'VE SPENT EVERY WAKING MOMENT, EVERY EXTRA MINUTE OF TIME LOOKING AT OUT."
200,ep147,"IF I DRIVE BY A HOUSE THAT HAS A FOR SALE SIGN, IT BETTER HAVE A FLIER, SO I CAN STOP AND PULL OVER AND CHECK IT SALE."
201,ep147,HERE'S A HOUSE THAT'S FOR OKAY.
202,ep147,"OH, YEAH, EYE."
203,ep147,"(Suzanne) AS THE ENGLANDERS AND THEIR REALTOR DRIVE THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD THEY PARTICULARLY LIKE, THIS CHARMING SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE CATCHES THEIR MUCH?"
204,ep147,DOES IT SAY HOW PRICE.
205,ep147,"WELL, IT'S ABOVE OUR HAVE?"
206,ep147,HOW MANY BEDROOMS DO THEY WOW.
207,ep147,"LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOT THREE BEDROOMS, OH, BATHS."
208,ep147,TWO FULL APPOINTMENT?
209,ep147,WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO ASK THE OWNERS IF THEY'LL LET US COME IN EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.
210,ep147,"(Suzanne) IT ISN'T STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE, BUT KAREN O'CONNELL, THE COUPLE'S REALTOR, OFFERS TO ASK THE SELLERS IF SHE COULD SHOW HER CLIENTS THEIR HOME WITHOUT AN FOR..."
211,ep147,"FROM THE OUTSIDE, AT LEAST, THE HOME IS JUST WHAT MITCH AND JAYNE ARE LOOKING WONDER?"
212,ep147,"DOES IT HAVE A BACKYARD, I NEEDS."
213,ep147,"(Suzanne) EXCEPT THE ASKING PRICE IS $30,000 MORE THAN THEY WANT TO SPEND, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE ENGLANDERS ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT ANY HOME THAT MIGHT FIT THEIR VERY SPECIFIC TODAY."
214,ep147,"HI, THANKS FOR OPENING YOUR HOUSE TO US NEIGHBORHOOD."
215,ep147,SURE. WERE IN THE IN.
216,ep147,COME ON SO...
217,ep147,"(Mitchell) WE SAW THE FOR SALE SIGN, WAY."
218,ep147,I'M GONNA JUST GET OUT OF YOUR LOOK.
219,ep147,FEEL FREE TO MUCH.
220,ep147,"OKAY, THANK YOU VERY YOU."
221,ep147,THANK ROOM.
222,ep147,LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE NICE.
223,ep147,(Jayne) VERY WOW.
224,ep147,"OH, WONDERFUL."
225,ep147,(Mitchell) THIS IS ROOM.
226,ep147,THIS IS A NICE- SIZE NICE.
227,ep147,THIS IS REAL CEILINGS...
228,ep147,LIKE THE HOUSE.
229,ep147,IT'S GOT THE SAME COVED CEILINGS THAT ARE IN THE REST OF THE NICE.
230,ep147,SO THAT'S REAL RANGE.
231,ep147,(Mitchell) WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED ANYTHING IN THIS PRICE BASIS.
232,ep147,SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND SEE IF WE CAN AFFORD THIS ON A MONTHLY HEAD.
233,ep147,I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET IN OVER MY BATHROOM.
234,ep147,I REALLY LIKE THIS SINKS.
235,ep147,"LOOK, HON, IT HAS TWO FOR."
236,ep147,IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING INSIDE.
237,ep147,"MM-HMM. I WAS RELUCTANT TO EVEN GO INTO THE HOUSE BECAUSE WHEN MITCH FIRST PULLED THE FLIER OUT, HE SHOWED ME THE PRICE, AND I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO WASTE OUR TIME TO GO MONEY."
238,ep147,"ONCE I WAS IN IT, I WAS MORE EXCITED BECAUSE IT DID HAVE THE FEATURES WE WERE LOOKING FOR, BUT REALISTICALLY, I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET A LOAN FOR THIS MUCH TOURS."
239,ep147,(Mitchell) WE'VE TAKEN LINDSAY ALONG TO SEE SOME OF THE HOUSES DURING THE ROOM.
240,ep147,"SHE DOESN'T QUITE GRASP THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT HOMES, AND THAT WE'RE MOVING, BUT SHE DOES GET THE IDEA THAT SHE'S GONNA GET A NEW MINE?"
241,ep147,"SO SHE ASKS RIGHT AWAY, WHICH ROOM'S MINE?"
242,ep147,WHICH ROOM'S OUT.
243,ep147,SHE GOES RUNNING INTO THE ROOM TO CHECK IT KITCHEN.
244,ep147,(Mitchell) THE IT.
245,ep147,"OH, WOW, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF BIG."
246,ep147,"BIG, VERY IT."
247,ep147,"OH, I LOVE RENTING."
248,ep147,(Mitchell) WE REALLY LIKE THE SIZE OF THE KITCHEN WE HAVE NOW IN THE HOUSE WE'RE AREA.
249,ep147,"WE WANT TO FIND SOMETHING AT LEAST COMPARABLE IN SIZE, WITH A BREAKFAST NOOK OR AN EATING WINDOWS..."
250,ep147,LOOK AT THESE LOT.
251,ep147,I LIKE THIS A SINK...
252,ep147,FRENCH WINDOW LOOK OVER THE SET.
253,ep147,"(Suzanne) IN ADDITION TO HAVING A SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM AND A COMFORTABLE KITCHEN, THE HOME ALSO HAS A BACKYARD PATIO AND A GRASSY PLAY AREA WITH SPACE FOR A SWING OVERALL."
254,ep147,♪♪ (Mitchell) I REALLY LIKE THE HOUSE CONSIDER.
255,ep147,DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO INTERESTING...
256,ep147,"YEAH, IT WAS VERY NICE."
257,ep147,IT WAS IN.
258,ep147,"(Mitchell) IT'S GOT ALL THE FEATURES WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR-- THE BIG LIVING ROOM, THE WIDE OPEN FLOOR PLAN, TWO SINKS IN THE BATHROOM, AND THE BIGGEST BENEFIT, I THINK, IS WE CAN MOVE RIGHT MAJOR."
259,ep147,NOTHING REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT'S HOUSE.
260,ep147,"BUT IT'S A LOT MORE MONEY THAN WE WANTED TO SPEND, AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO CONSIDER WHEN WE START THINKING ABOUT IF WE WANT TO MAKE AN OFFER ON THIS IT?"
261,ep147,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT MITCH AND JAYNE HAVE FOUND THE HOUSE THEY WANT, CAN THEY AFFORD HUNTERS."
262,ep147,NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS...
263,ep147,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE WHANG.
264,ep147,I'M SUZANNE MAKE.
265,ep147,"OUR HOUSE HUNTERS, MITCH AND JANE ENGLANDER AND THEIR DAUGHTER LINDSAY, HAVE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS TO HANDS."
266,ep147,"THEY'VE SEEN A HOUSE THAT HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED AND MOST OF THE THINGS THEY WANT, BUT THEY HAVE A SERIOUS DILEMMA ON THEIR IT?"
267,ep147,"NOW THAT THEY'VE SEEN THE HOUSE THEY WANT, WILL THEY BE ABLE TO AFFORD REACH."
268,ep147,"AFTER REASSESSING THEIR FINANCES, MITCH AND JANE FOUND THAT IF THEY BORROWED FROM THEIR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, THE ASKING PRICE ON THE HOME WASN'T SO FAR OUT OF THEIR HALFWAY."
269,ep147,(Mitchell) SO WE DECIDED TO WRITE UP AN OFFER FOR WHAT WE THINK WE COULD AFFORD AND HOPEFULLY THE SELLER WILL BRING THE PRICE DOWN A LITTLE AND MEET US SELLERS.
270,ep147,♪♪ (Jayne) WE WANTED TO INCLUDE A LETTER WITH OUR OFFER TO THE OFFER.
271,ep147,"(Mitchell) WE WANTED THEM TO KNOW WHO WE WERE WHEN WE WERE PRESENTING THE OFFER, SINCE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRESENT IT IN PERSON, AND JUST PERSONALIZE THE US."
272,ep147,(Jayne) YOUR HOME WOULD MAKE A WELCOME ADDITION TO OUR FAMILY AND WOULD EMBRACE MANY YEARS OF EXCITEMENT AND MEMORIES FOR HOME.
273,ep147,"THIS IS OUR FIRST HOME PURCHASE, AND WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR TIME AND EFFORT IN SHOWING US YOUR ENGLANDER."
274,ep147,"SINCERELY, JAYNE AND MITCHELL PART."
275,ep147,"(Suzanne) BUT AS THE ENGLANDERS ARE FINDING OUT, SOMETIMES MAKING THE OFFER IS THE EASY POINT."
276,ep147,(Mitchell) WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED AT THIS COUNTEROFFERS.
277,ep147,WE'RE ON THE SEVENTH ROUND OF POINT.
278,ep147,"IT'S BEEN ABOUT A WEEK SINCE OUR LAST OFFER WAS PRESENTED, AND THIS IS LIKE THE MAKE- OR-BREAK NEEDLES."
279,ep147,IT'S LIKE WAITING ON PINS AND IT.
280,ep147,"I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT, AND WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING ELSE, SO THIS IS CALLED..."
281,ep147,"(Suzanne) SO WHEN THE COUPLE'S REALTOR, KAREN O'CONNELL, FINALLY FANTASTIC..."
282,ep147,"OH, OFFER!"
283,ep147,THEY ACCEPTED THE ...
284,ep147,(Suzanne) ECSTATIC.
285,ep147,MITCH AND JAYNE WERE REALIZED.
286,ep147,"IN THE 90 DAYS THE COUPLE GAVE THEMSELVES TO FIND A HOME, THEY TOURED FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS, VISITED 62 SEPARATE HOMES AND MADE A SUM TOTAL OF SEVEN COUNTEROFFERS BEFORE THEIR DREAM OF OWNING A HOME WAS FINALLY CROSSED."
287,ep147,BUT THE SALE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL ALL THE I'S ARE DOTTED AND THE T'S ARE CLOSE.
288,ep147,"FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE ON THE PURCHASE OF THEIR NEW HOME, THE ENGLANDERS AND THEIR REALTOR HAVE SCHEDULED A WALK-THROUGH TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THEIR FUTURE HOME AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY FOR THE SALE TO HELLO."
289,ep147,"HI, DOIN'?"
290,ep147,"GOOD MORNING, HOW YOU IN."
291,ep147,COME ON DETAIL.
292,ep147,"(Suzanne) THIS IS THE ENGLANDER'S LAST OPPORTUNITY TO BE INSIDE THIS HOUSE UNTIL THEY MOVE INTO IT FOR GOOD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS, SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY TAKE IN EVERY ROOM."
293,ep147,LET'S START WITH THE LIVING FIXTURES.
294,ep147,"YOU WANNA BE SURE YOU CHECK THE CARPETING, THE BASEBOARDS, THE FLOOR, THE WALL, CEILINGS, ELECTRICAL ONCE-OVER."
295,ep147,(Suzanne) THE ENGLANDERS HAVE BROUGHT ALONG THEIR FRIEND AND CONTRACTOR BOB LEON TO HELP THEM GIVE THE HOUSE A THOROUGH AGE.
296,ep147,"(Mitchell) IT'S INTERESTING TO DO A WALK-THROUGH BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIRST WALK THROUGH A HOUSE, IT LOOKS GREAT, BUT THEN WHEN YOU SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME GOING OVER EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY, YOU START FINDING ALL THE DEFECTS OF THE HOUSE, AND IT SHOWS ITS OUT."
297,ep147,"THE HOUSE WE'RE BUYING IS 65 YEARS OLD, AND THE LITTLE THINGS START TO COME LITTLE..."
298,ep147,"OVERALL, EVERYTHING WENT REALLY WELL, AND IT NEEDS VERY COSMETIC."
299,ep147,IT'S ALL YOU.
300,ep147,THANK NOW...
301,ep147,BYE-BYE. WE'RE REALLY GETTING EXCITED INSPECTION.
302,ep147,"NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THE LOAN APPROVED, AND WE'VE DONE THE HOME PAPERWORK."
303,ep147,(Mitchell) NOW THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO DO BEFORE THE SALE CLOSES IS ACTUALLY PUT OUR NAME ON THE X AND SIGN THE FINAL IT?
304,ep147,(Suzanne) SO DID THEY DO LAUREN?
305,ep147,"DID JAYNE AND MITCH COMPLETE THE SALE AND SETTLE IN ALL BEFORE THE BIRTH OF THEIR SECOND DAUGHTER, CLOCK..."
306,ep147,(Jayne) WE BEAT THE PERSONALLY.
307,ep147,"'CAUSE WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE, WE HAD SO MANY PROJECTS THAT WE HAD TO WORK ON, JUST THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO GET DONE BORN."
308,ep147,WE WANTED TO GET IT ALL DONE BEFORE THE BABY WAS ROOMS.
309,ep147,SO EVERY NIGHT WE WERE WORKING NONSTOP JUST HANGING PICTURES AND REARRANGING THE US.
310,ep147,IT WORKED OUT FOR THEIRS.
311,ep147,"(Suzanne) AFTER MOVING IN, THE ENGLANDERS FOUND THAT THEIR OLD FURNITURE FIT PERFECTLY INTO THE LAYOUT OF THEIR NEW HOME, AND WITH A LITTLE PAINT AND SOME PICTURES ON THE WALLS, THE HOME QUICKLY BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE IT WAS HOME."
312,ep147,(Lindsay) WELCOME BABY.
313,ep147,(Mitch) HERE'S THE NEW HOME FOR THE IT...
314,ep147,(Suzanne) WE LOVE HOME.
315,ep147,IT FEELS LIKE DOES...
316,ep147,(Mitch) IT ELSE.
317,ep147,"IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET USED TO LIVING IN A DIFFERENT HOME, BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE HOME, AND I COULDN'T SEE LIVING ANYWHERE HOUSE..."
318,ep147,WE'RE IN THE DAUGHTER.
319,ep147,"THE PROJECTS ARE DONE, AND WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL NEW ADDITION TO THE HOUSE AND TO OUR FAMILY, AND THAT'S OUR NEW FEELING."
320,ep147,"SO IT'S A GREAT, GREAT BETTER."

1,ep148,SUZANNE WHANG.
2,ep148,WELCOME TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
3,ep148,BARRY AND JUDY WALLACE HAVE GROWN TIRED OF THE HASSLES OF SUBURBAN LIVING.
4,ep148,MAINTAINING A HOME AND A YARD JUST ISN'T FOR THEM.
5,ep148,SO THE WALLACES SOLD THEIR HOUSE AND MOVED INTO A CITY APARTMENT.
6,ep148,"BUT AFTER LIVING THERE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, THE WALLACES ARE ONCE AGAIN LONGING FOR A PLACE OF THEIR OWN."
7,ep148,"SO THEY'VE DECIDED TO BUY AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IN A DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT."
8,ep148,CAN THE WALLACES ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF HOME OWNERSHIP WITHOUT ALL THE MAINTENANCE?
9,ep148,IT'S ALL NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
10,ep148,♪♪ (Suzanne) JUDY AND BARRY WALLACE HAD ACHIEVED WHAT SOME WOULD CONSIDER THE AMERICAN DREAM.
11,ep148,THEY WERE THE OWNERS OF A CHARMING HOME IN THE SUBURBS.
12,ep148,"BUT AFTER TWO YEARS OF CONTINUALLY MAINTAINING AND REPAIRING THEIR HOME, THE WALLACES DECIDED THAT SUBURBAN LIVING WAS JUST NOT FOR THEM."
13,ep148,"(Judy) WE USED TO OWN A HOUSE ABOUT, WHAT, EIGHT MONTHS AGO, NINE MONTHS AGO."
14,ep148,WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT.
15,ep148,"YEAH. IT WAS FUN, BECAUSE IT WAS OUR FIRST HOME, AND, YOU KNOW, WE WERE CREATING, BUYING NEW FURNITURE, BUYING THE FLOWERS FOR THE GARDEN."
16,ep148,BUT THEN THAT GOT INTO EVERY WEEKEND YOU HAVE TO GARDEN AND CLEAN THE POOL AND SO FORTH.
17,ep148,IT WAS JUST AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF WORK.
18,ep148,THE REASON WHY APARTMENT LIVING APPEALS TO US IS NOT HAVING TO DO ALL THE UPKEEP.
19,ep148,"THE TYPE OF LIFESTYLE THAT WE LIVE, WHEN YOU FINALLY GET SOME TIME OFF, YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO THOSE TYPE OF THINGS--FOR US."
20,ep148,"(Judy) FRANKLY WE LIKE THE URBAN LIFESTYLE, SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT."
21,ep148,WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE BEST IDEA.
22,ep148,(Suzanne) SO BARRY AND JUDY WALLACE LEFT SUBURBIA FOR THE CONVENIENCE AND EXCITEMENT OF A MORE URBAN LIFESTYLE AND BEGAN RENTING A TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE CITY.
23,ep148,"HI, YEAH, I'D LIKE TO ORDER A PIZZA, PLEASE."
24,ep148,(Judy) THE KITCHEN'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT FOR US.
25,ep148,"WE BOTH LIKE TO EAT OUT A LOT, AND WE DON'T LIKE TO COOK."
26,ep148,SO WE GO OUT.
27,ep148,THE KITCHEN'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT FOR US.
28,ep148,(Barry) ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY LIKE TO DO IS HAVE MY OWN SPACE.
29,ep148,"YOU KNOW, I HAVE A COMPUTER."
30,ep148,"AND I LIKE TO, YOU KNOW, PLAY GAMES."
31,ep148,AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF EQUIPMENT.
32,ep148,SO I'M REALLY HOPING TO GET A LITTLE COMPUTER ROOM OR A PLACE THAT I CAN HAVE AS MY OWN.
33,ep148,"BAR, PIZZA'S HERE..."
34,ep148,GET THE PLATES.
35,ep148,"(Barry) ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT THE APARTMENT THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW IS THERE'S A LOT OF LIGHT, AND I JUST LIKE THE AIRINESS OF IT."
36,ep148,IT'S VERY NICE...
37,ep148,WE LIKE THAT.
38,ep148,"(Suzanne) THE OTHER THING JUDY AND BARRY LIKE ABOUT THEIR CURRENT APARTMENT IS ITS LOCATION, WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF DOWNTOWN SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS."
39,ep148,"(Judy) WHAT WE CALL THE STRIP IS A COUPLE BLOCKS DOWN, SO WE CAN WALK TO ANYWHERE."
40,ep148,"(Barry) SEE, IN THIS AREA YOU HAVE..."
41,ep148,"RESTAURANTS ARE OPEN LATE, YOU HAVE MOVIE THEATERS VERY CLOSE, YOU HAVE COFFEE SHOPS, YOU'VE GOT..."
42,ep148,(Judy) SHOPPING.
43,ep148,(Barry) SHOPPING...
44,ep148,"I MEAN, WE'RE LIKE A BLOCK TO TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM, YOU KNOW, A WONDERFUL AREA WHERE THEY HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS."
45,ep148,(Judy) YOU CAN WALK TO GET ICE CREAM.
46,ep148,"YOU CAN WALK TO GET THAI, CHINESE..."
47,ep148,YOU CAN JUST WALK TO ANYTHING.
48,ep148,"IF YOU WANT PLASTIC SURGERY, YOU CAN WALK TO YOUR PLASTIC SURGEON."
49,ep148,HE'S ON THE STRIP AS WELL.
50,ep148,(Suzanne) THE WALLACES LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVING ALL OF ITS AMENITIES AT THEIR FINGERTIPS.
51,ep148,"BUT AFTER EIGHT MONTHS, THE RESTRICTIONS OF RENTING HAVE BECOME TOO MUCH FOR BARRY AND JUDY."
52,ep148,"ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO DO WITHIN THIS PLACE-- FOR INSTANCE, PUTTING UP NEW SHADES, NEW LIGHT FIXTURES-- HAS TO BE RUN THROUGH THE LANDLORD."
53,ep148,AND I HATE THAT.
54,ep148,THE MOST LOGICAL SOLUTION WOULD BE A CONDO.
55,ep148,"THERE'S NO UPKEEP IN A CONDO, AND IT'S OURS, SO WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT WITHIN THOSE WALLS."
56,ep148,"NEW FIXTURES, NEW SHADES, NEW PAINT, WHATEVER, WE CAN DO THAT."
57,ep148,(Barry) OVER THE YEARS WE'VE COLLECTED SOME NICE ART.
58,ep148,AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE NEW SPACE IS JUST A PLACE TO SHOW IT OFF.
59,ep148,AND IT'S JUST VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE WAY THAT THE ART PRESENTS ITSELF FITS IN THE SPACE.
60,ep148,"BUYING A HOUSE, I THINK, WOULD BE SIMILAR TO BUYING ART."
61,ep148,"WHEN YOU SEE IT, EITHER YOU LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T."
62,ep148,"AND I THINK IT WILL BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE JUST SEE SOMETHING AND GO, THIS IS IT."
63,ep148,"(Suzanne) JUDY AND BARRY HAVE NOT YET FOUND A REALTOR, BUT THAT HAS NOT STOPPED THEM FROM BEGINNING THEIR HOUSE HUNT."
64,ep148,"(Judy) HI, WE'RE HERE TO SEE THE MONO CONDOS."
65,ep148,"(Suzanne) THEY HAVE ISOLATED THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE AND HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING ALL THE OPTIONS IN THE AREA, INCLUDING THIS HIGH-RISE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX."
66,ep148,THIS IS INTERESTING.
67,ep148,"YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
68,ep148,THERE'S A LOT OF LIGHT.
69,ep148,BEDROOM'S KIND OF SMALL.
70,ep148,"OKAY, WELL LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER ONES."
71,ep148,(Judy) SOME OF THESE PLACES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
72,ep148,IT'S JUST NOT OUR STYLE.
73,ep148,"THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT TOO STUFFY, I WOULD SAY, AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC."
74,ep148,THIS IS NICE.
75,ep148,"OH, GREAT VIEW."
76,ep148,"(Barry) WE'RE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING, WE NORMALLY KNOW RIGHT AWAY IF WE LIKE IT OR NOT."
77,ep148,"I THINK WHEN WE FIND THE SPACE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, WE'LL JUST KNOW IT RIGHT AWAY."
78,ep148,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
79,ep148,THE COLORS ARE NICE.
80,ep148,"IT'S A BIT FORMAL FOR US, DON'T YOU THINK?"
81,ep148,"YEAH, I DO."
82,ep148,"OKAY, WELL LET'S KEEP LOOKING."
83,ep148,ALL RIGHT.
84,ep148,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, WE'LL SEE WHAT BARRY AND JUDY TURN UP IN THE REAL ESTATE ADS."
85,ep148,"WOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?"
86,ep148,THIS IS GREAT.
87,ep148,(Suzanne) STAY TUNED...
88,ep148,WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
89,ep148,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
90,ep148,JUDY AND BARRY WALLACE SOLD THEIR SUBURBAN HOME AFTER BECOMING BOGGED DOWN WITH REPAIRS AND UPKEEP.
91,ep148,NOW THIS PROFESSIONAL COUPLE HAS MOVED INTO A DOWNTOWN APARTMENT.
92,ep148,BUT THEY'VE GROWN TIRED OF ALL THE RESTRICTIONS THAT COME WITH RENTING.
93,ep148,JUDY AND BARRY ARE NOW HOPING TO BUY A LITTLE PIECE OF PARADISE IN THE FORM OF A CONDOMINIUM IN THE HEART OF THE CITY.
94,ep148,(Barry) WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND AN AGENT YET.
95,ep148,"SO WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO IS TO GO OUT AND KIND OF, YOU KNOW, EXPLORE THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND JUST KIND OF SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE."
96,ep148,"HELLO, IS THIS KATHY?"
97,ep148,"YEAH, HI, KATHY, THIS IS BARRY."
98,ep148,I'D LIKE TO SEE THE PLACE YOU HAVE IN THE KRESS LOFTS.
99,ep148,WHEN CAN YOU DO IT?
100,ep148,WE'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT DOWN THE STREET.
101,ep148,"(Barry) WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR APARTMENTS ON OUR OWN, MAKING APPOINTMENTS, AND WE'RE REALLY HOPING THAT WE'LL FIND A REALLY GREAT AGENT IN THE PROCESS."
102,ep148,"HI, I'M KATHY SHASHA WITH PRUDENTIAL REAL ESTATE."
103,ep148,HI. TO MEET YOU.
104,ep148,NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.
105,ep148,HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN THE BUILDING BEFORE?
106,ep148,"NO, THIS WILL BE OUR FIRST TIME."
107,ep148,FIRST TIME.
108,ep148,"GREAT, WELL, THE KRESS LOFTS ARE VERY, VERY FUN."
109,ep148,"I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY, REALLY ENJOY 'EM."
110,ep148,COME ON IN.
111,ep148,THANKS. LOVE THIS BRICK.
112,ep148,I LIKE THIS...
113,ep148,THIS IS NICE.
114,ep148,WAS THIS HERE ORIGINALLY?
115,ep148,"THAT WAS ADDED IN, BUT THEY TRIED TO KEEP IT IN WITH THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING."
116,ep148,THE BUILDING HAS A LOT OF HISTORY.
117,ep148,"WHY DON'T WE GO UP, AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT?"
118,ep148,I LIKE THAT...
119,ep148,IT'S INTERESTING.
120,ep148,IT WAS BUILT IN 1923 AS PART OF THE KRESS DEPARTMENT STORE CHAIN.
121,ep148,THE DEVELOPER SAVED THE BUILDING DAYS BEFORE IT WAS TO BE TORN DOWN AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RETROFIT THE BUILDING.
122,ep148,"(Suzanne) LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE CITY, THE KRESS BUILDING HAS A VERY URBAN FEEL AND AN INCREDIBLE VIEW TO GO WITH IT."
123,ep148,ISN'T THIS GREAT?
124,ep148,"YOU'VE GOT THE OCEAN FIVE BLOCKS AWAY, AND YOU'VE GOT THIS KIND OF VIEW OF DOWNTOWN."
125,ep148,THIS IS FANTASTIC...
126,ep148,I LOVE THIS VIEW.
127,ep148,I REALLY LIKE IT.
128,ep148,THIS IS GREAT.
129,ep148,AND I THINK YOU GUYS ARE REALLY GONNA LIKE THIS.
130,ep148,THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN AS FAR AS PROPERTY.
131,ep148,WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?
132,ep148,THIS IS GREAT...
133,ep148,I LOVE THIS.
134,ep148,THIS IS FANTASTIC.
135,ep148,THE PILLARS...
136,ep148,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
137,ep148,THEY'RE NICE.
138,ep148,"THIS IS VERY NICE, KATHY."
139,ep148,THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
140,ep148,RIGHT. A LOOK AT THE VIEW.
141,ep148,ISN'T THAT GREAT?
142,ep148,THIS IS REALLY NICE.
143,ep148,I BET YOU IT HAS A REALLY NICE NIGHT SKYLINE.
144,ep148,YEAH. AT THE BEDROOM.
145,ep148,"IT'S NICE, BUT IT'S SMALL."
146,ep148,IT'S VERY NICE.
147,ep148,A LITTLE BIT BIGGER WOULD BE NICE.
148,ep148,(Suzanne) FOR BARRY AND JUDY THE STYLE OF THE LOFT IS PERFECT.
149,ep148,"BUT AT 1000 SQUARE FEET, IT'S JUST TOO SMALL."
150,ep148,"THE SPACE IS A LITTLE TOO SMALL FOR YOU, YOU THINK?"
151,ep148,A LITTLE BIT.
152,ep148,A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL.
153,ep148,"I CAN DEFINITELY SEE US, THOUGH, IN THIS BUILDING."
154,ep148,"(Suzanne) LUCKILY KATHY KNOWS OF TWO OTHER AVAILABLE LOFTS IN THE BUILDING, WITH MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE."
155,ep148,"OF COURSE, ALL THE EXPOSED PIPING AND EVERYTHING IS WHAT THEY WANTED TO LEAVE AS PART OF THE URBAN- INDUSTRIAL LOOK THAT THE BUILDING HAS."
156,ep148,"OKAY, COME ON IN."
157,ep148,THIS LOFT IS ACTUALLY THE BEST BUY IN THE BUILDING.
158,ep148,"IT'S ABOUT 1,100 SQUARE FEET, IT HAS WONDERFUL LIGHT WITH NORTH AND EAST EXPOSURES."
159,ep148,THIS SPACE HAS GOT A REALLY GREAT FEEL.
160,ep148,I LIKE THE WAY THAT IT FEELS...
161,ep148,"THE OPENNESS, JUST THE WAY THAT IT LOOKS, THE LIGHT."
162,ep148,"(Suzanne) WITH ONLY 1,100 SQUARE FEET, THIS LOFT IS STILL NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR JUDY AND BARRY'S NEEDS."
163,ep148,I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS ONE.
164,ep148,IT'S GOT A LOT MORE FEELING OF A LOT MORE ROOM.
165,ep148,"AND ACTUALLY, IT IS BIGGER."
166,ep148,(Judy) I LOVE THE HEIGHTH.
167,ep148,COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THESE WINDOWS OVER HERE.
168,ep148,(Judy) I'M VERY AWARE OF LIGHT.
169,ep148,"LIGHT TO ME MEANS ACTIVITY, MEANS ENERGY, MEANS MOVEMENT."
170,ep148,SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.
171,ep148,I NEED A HOME THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT.
172,ep148,I LOVE THE VIEW.
173,ep148,IT'S REALLY NICE.
174,ep148,"AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS ONE IS IT'S A SPLIT LEVEL, SO YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF A DIFFERENT FLOOR PLAN HERE."
175,ep148,WHY DON'T WE GO UP AND...
176,ep148,IS THIS THE BEDROOM?
177,ep148,"WELL, IF YOU'D LIKE IT TO BE IT IS."
178,ep148,LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT.
179,ep148,NOW YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE POOL OF A SPACE UP HERE TO WORK WITH TOO.
180,ep148,"THIS COULD BE OUR BEDROOM, BARRY."
181,ep148,THIS IS NICE...
182,ep148,THIS IS BIG.
183,ep148,(Suzanne) THE WALLACES ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES WITH THE SPACE.
184,ep148,I LOVE THIS BRICK.
185,ep148,THE BRICK'S NICE.
186,ep148,LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OVER HERE.
187,ep148,I THINK THERE'S WASTED SPACE HERE.
188,ep148,YEAH. THINK WE COULD DO SOMETHING WITH THIS.
189,ep148,I THINK SO TOO.
190,ep148,(Barry) I REALLY LIKE THIS SPACE.
191,ep148,IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING WE'VE SEEN SO FAR.
192,ep148,"I WISH IT COULD BE JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER, BUT I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP ON THIS PLACE AT THIS POINT."
193,ep148,IT DEFINITELY HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL.
194,ep148,YOU GUYS LIKE THIS PLACE?
195,ep148,"YEAH, WE DO."
196,ep148,"(Suzanne) SINCE BARRY AND JUDY LOVE THE STYLE OF THE LOFT, KATHY SUGGESTS THAT THEY DOUBLE THEIR LIVING SPACE BY PURCHASING TWO ADJACENT LOFTS."
197,ep148,SHE OFFERS TO CHECK WITH THE BUILDING'S TENANTS TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM MIGHT BE WILLING TO SELL.
198,ep148,"HEY, GREAT, YOU GUYS..."
199,ep148,"WELL, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH."
200,ep148,NICE MEETING YOU.
201,ep148,NICE MEETING YOU.
202,ep148,"AND I'LL CHECK ON THOSE OTHER LOFTS, AND WE'LL TALK TO YOU IN A COUPLE DAYS, OKAY?"
203,ep148,GREAT. THANK YOU.
204,ep148,"ALL RIGHTY, BYE-BYE."
205,ep148,(Suzanne) IS FINDING A SECOND LOFT SPACE THE SOLUTION TO ALL OF THE WALLACES' PROBLEMS?
206,ep148,OR WILL THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME?
207,ep148,"FIND OUT, WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS."
208,ep148,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
209,ep148,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
210,ep148,"BARRY AND JUDY WALLACE WENT FROM SUBURBAN HOME OWNERSHIP TO RENTING A CITY APARTMENT, BEFORE A LOFT SPACE IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN CAUGHT THEIR EYE."
211,ep148,"THE STYLE IS JUST RIGHT, BUT THE SIZE IS NOT."
212,ep148,"SO JUDY AND BARRY'S REALTOR, KATHY SHASHA, GENEROUSLY VOLUNTEERED TO CHECK WITH THE BUILDING'S OTHER TENANTS TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WOULD BE WILLING TO SELL."
213,ep148,"THIS WOULD ENABLE BARRY AND JUDY TO BUY TWO ADJACENT LOFTS, TO GIVE THEM THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THEY WANT."
214,ep148,HI. KATHY WITH PRUDENTIAL REAL ESTATE.
215,ep148,I'VE GOT SOME CLIENTS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR A LARGE LOFT THAT THEY'D LIKE TO BUY.
216,ep148,HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO SELLING?
217,ep148,"NO. ACTUALLY, I'M PAINTING RIGHT NOW, AND I JUST BOUGHT ABOUT A MONTH AGO, AND THINGS ARE GOING GREAT."
218,ep148,"OH, OKAY."
219,ep148,"WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME."
220,ep148,"THANK YOU, BYE."
221,ep148,"(Suzanne) KATHY HAD NO LUCK FINDING SELLERS, BUT SHE HAS ONE MORE IDEA FOR JUDY AND BARRY."
222,ep148,"IF THEY HIRE AN ARCHITECT, PERHAPS THEY CAN RECONFIGURE A SINGLE LOFT TO PROVIDE MORE USABLE SPACE."
223,ep148,THE WALLACES HAVE TURNED TO ARCHITECT RODNEY FREEH TO HELP THEM SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM.
224,ep148,"OH, WOW, LOOK AT THIS BEAM THAT'S CANTILEVERED OUT HERE."
225,ep148,IT'S NICE.
226,ep148,EVERYTHING'S EXPOSED.
227,ep148,"MMM-HMM. NEVER DONE A LOFT BEFORE, BUT IT CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE, I CAN SEE THAT."
228,ep148,WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THE HEIGHT.
229,ep148,"HOWEVER, IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HALL..."
230,ep148,I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT.
231,ep148,NO... AGREE.
232,ep148,"YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT RIGHT AWAY."
233,ep148,WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TO OPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
234,ep148,AND MAYBE YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS.
235,ep148,SURE. TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.
236,ep148,"(Barry) THE REASON WHY WE ENLISTED AN ARCHITECT WAS THAT WE HAD BEEN TO THIS PLACE SEVERAL TIMES, NOT REALLY KNOWING IF WE COULD DO CERTAIN THINGS."
237,ep148,"YOU KNOW, COULD THIS WALL GO OUT?"
238,ep148,COULD WE PUT A SECOND LEVEL IN?
239,ep148,COULD WE CHANGE THE BATHROOM...
240,ep148,"I MEAN, COULD WE MAKE CHANGES?"
241,ep148,"IF YOU NOTICE, THERE'S A LOT OF DEAD SPACE OVER HERE, AND I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT."
242,ep148,EXACTLY. NOW IT'S COMPLETELY DEAD...
243,ep148,IT'S A HALLWAY.
244,ep148,YOU CAN JUST SEE THAT IT'S A HALLWAY.
245,ep148,"RIGHT, YEAH."
246,ep148,AND THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL WINDOW.
247,ep148,"I MEAN, WE COULD DO A CURVE, LIKE A ROUNDED CORNER, OKAY."
248,ep148,"OR MAYBE CUT IT OFF DIAGONALLY IN HERE, JUST SO THAT THIS UNUSED SPACE, THIS CORRIDOR LIKE IN HERE, BECOMES MORE OF A FUNCTIONAL LIVING AREA."
249,ep148,OKAY. WHAT I'M SAYING?
250,ep148,THAT SOUNDS GREAT...
251,ep148,YEAH. BARRY AND JUDY'S MAJOR CONCERN IS MAKING THE LOFT FEEL LARGER.
252,ep148,"IF RODNEY THINKS IT'S POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THIS WALLED-OFF AREA, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET THE LIVING SPACE THEY NEED."
253,ep148,THIS IS THE CLOSET AREA AND THE WASHER AND DRYER.
254,ep148,I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS OUT SO WE HAVE MORE LIVING SPACE.
255,ep148,"RIGHT, I CAN AGREE WITH THAT."
256,ep148,"ALSO, WE HAVE THE BATHROOM, AND THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNED ME IS THAT RIGHT HERE WE HAVE THAT PILLAR."
257,ep148,SAME PILLAR THAT'S SHOWING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL THEN?
258,ep148,"YEAH. OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T MOVE IT, BUT WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT A FEATURE OF THE ROOM, AND IF WE DO CUT THE WALL DIAGONALLY, IT COULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE."
259,ep148,"(Suzanne) STEPPING UP FIVE FEET TO THE BEDROOM LEVEL, JUDY AND BARRY EXPLAIN TO RODNEY THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE BATHROOM FROM THE MASTER BEDROOM AND THEIR NEED FOR AMPLE CLOSET SPACE."
260,ep148,"IF I DO THE DIAGONAL I WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO KEEP THAT GOING, SO THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DRAMATIC SO WE GET THIS ANGLE GOING ACROSS, GIVING THE ILLUSION OF MORE SPACE, MORE LENGTH, A POSSIBLE STORAGE AREA OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL LOOK."
261,ep148,"GREAT. SO RODNEY, THE SECOND LEVEL, YES."
262,ep148,POSSIBLY DIAGONALLY ACROSS HERE?
263,ep148,"YES. IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT WELL, WE'LL MISS THE COLUMN."
264,ep148,"IN OTHER WORDS, THE COLUMN WILL BE IN FRONT OF IT AND IT WOULD BE MORE AN ACCENT."
265,ep148,"AND THEN WE'LL GO ON THROUGH WITH THE SECOND LEVEL, GOING ALL THE WAY ACROSS TO THE WALL THERE."
266,ep148,"AND IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT WELL, MAYBE I CAN TUCK THE KITCHEN BACK IN A LITTLE BIT, SO IT ISN'T SUCH A STRIP KITCHEN, SO GENERIC LOOKING."
267,ep148,"HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE FOR US TO GET BACK TOGETHER, DRAW PLANS, OR..."
268,ep148,? I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT SO I'D LIKE TO WORK ON THESE THINGS RIGHT AWAY.
269,ep148,SO GIVE ME A COUPLE OF DAYS AND MAYBE I CAN...
270,ep148,DO YOU HAVE A FAX?
271,ep148,"ABSOLUTELY. FAX, LET'S FAX."
272,ep148,LET'S GET STARTED.
273,ep148,"GREAT, LET'S DO IT."
274,ep148,THANK YOU FOR COMING.
275,ep148,"PLEASURE, THANK YOU FOR CALLING."
276,ep148,"(Suzanne) FIVE DAYS LATER WHEN RODNEY CALLED TO LET THE WALLACES KNOW HE'D COMPLETED THEIR PLANS, THEY WERE THRILLED."
277,ep148,JUDY AND BARRY HAVE BEEN WAITING TO PUT IN AN OFFER ON THE LOFT UNTIL RODNEY COULD CONFIRM THAT THE LOFT COULD BE OPENED UP ENOUGH TO GIVE THE COUPLE THE SPACE THEY NEED.
278,ep148,"HI, JUDY."
279,ep148,"HI, RODNEY, HOW ARE YOU?"
280,ep148,JUST FINE...
281,ep148,YOU READY FOR THIS?
282,ep148,"YEAH, COME ON IN."
283,ep148,"WELL, TODAY'S THE EXCITING DAY."
284,ep148,"LET'S GO THROUGH IT AS WE WALK THROUGH THE DOOR, AND MAYBE YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WAS AND WHAT WE HOPE TO DO."
285,ep148,(Suzanne) RODNEY'S FIRST IDEA IS TO TAKE OUT THE LOWER LEVEL CLOSET AREA TO MAKE THE LIVING ROOM LARGER.
286,ep148,AND SO NOW THAT WHOLE CORNER THAT WE HAD THERE BEFORE...
287,ep148,"GONE. NOW IT'S OPENED UP TO THE SECOND WINDOW, WHICH IS YOUR LIVING AREA, SO YOU HAVE THIS GREAT BIG LIVING AREA."
288,ep148,DO YOU LIKE THAT?
289,ep148,"YEAH, THIS IS VERY NICE."
290,ep148,"YEAH, OKAY."
291,ep148,AND OF COURSE THE STAIRS GO THE UPPER LEVEL.
292,ep148,"ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM BACK IN THIS AREA, YOU CAN SEE THE WINDOW IN THE BEDROOM, WHICH IS NICE, BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE ALL THAT WALL."
293,ep148,SO YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING-- THE WHOLE WALL OF WINDOWS.
294,ep148,YES. GREAT...
295,ep148,THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
296,ep148,"YES, AND YOU STILL HAVE YOUR PRIVACY IN THE BEDROOM AREA."
297,ep148,"PERFECT. ILLUSION IS A LOT MORE HEIGHT AND LENGTH IN THE UNIT, AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU'RE PUSHING FOR."
298,ep148,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
299,ep148,I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
300,ep148,THAT'S FANTASTIC.
301,ep148,"NOW THAT THE PROOF IS ON THE TABLE, I THINK YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU WANT FROM THE PLAN."
302,ep148,"YEAH, I THINK THIS IS FANTASTIC."
303,ep148,I THINK WE SHOULD DEFINITELY CALL KATHY UP AND PUT IN AN OFFER.
304,ep148,SO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
305,ep148,"OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY."
306,ep148,"OKAY, LET'S DO IT."
307,ep148,"GREAT. YOU, RODNEY."
308,ep148,THANK YOU.
309,ep148,THANKS RODNEY...
310,ep148,THANKS VERY MUCH.
311,ep148,YOU'RE WELCOME.
312,ep148,"(Suzanne) HAVING DECIDED TO WORK WITH AN ARCHITECT TO GET THE SPACE THEY NEED, THE WALLACES ARE ON A FAST TRACK TO GETTING THEIR DREAM HOME."
313,ep148,"WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, WE'LL CATCH UP WITH BARRY AND JUDY AND FIND OUT HOW THEY'VE FARED."
314,ep148,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
315,ep148,JUDY AND BARRY WALLACE FINALLY FOUND THE PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN SUBURBAN HOMEOWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE-FREE APARTMENT LIVING IN THE FORM OF AN URBAN LOFT SPACE.
316,ep148,"(Suzanne) AFTER ENLISTING THE HELP OF ARCHITECT RODNEY FREEH TO HELP THEM CREATE MORE SPACE, THE WALLACES ARE NOW CONVINCED THAT THIS URBAN DWELLING COULD IN FACT BECOME THEIR URBAN PARADISE."
317,ep148,"SO WITH REALTOR KATHY SHASHA'S HELP, JUDY AND BARRY MAKE AN OFFER."
318,ep148,NOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
319,ep148,"I'LL SEE YOU SOON, ABOUT 20 MINUTES."
320,ep148,"OKAY, I'LL PICK UP A PIZZA."
321,ep148,"BYE. TWO DAYS AFTER MAKING AN OFFER, BARRY, ON HIS WAY HOME FROM A MEETING, DECIDES TO CHECK IN WITH THEIR REALTOR TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE COMING ALONG."
322,ep148,"HEY, KATHY..."
323,ep148,"YEAH, THIS IS BARRY."
324,ep148,"HELLO, I'M HAVE WE HEARD YET?"
325,ep148,SO IT'S A GO?
326,ep148,THEY ACCEPTED THE OFFER?
327,ep148,"OH, FANTASTIC, JUDY'S GOING TO BE SO HAPPY."
328,ep148,WHOO-HOO! IT'S ALL SYSTEMS GO.
329,ep148,THE WALLACES ARE REVVING UP FOR A WHOLE NEW WAY OF LIFE.
330,ep148,"WE'VE BEEN LIVING HERE ABOUT FIVE MONTHS, AND SINCE WE'VE MOVED IN, WE'VE LOVED IT."
331,ep148,"ORIGINALLY, WE HAD WANTED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS TO THIS PLACE."
332,ep148,"BUT THEN AFTER LIVING HERE, IT HAS KIND OF CHANGED A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE WANTED TO DO."
333,ep148,(Suzanne) BARRY AND JUDY HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW THE SPACE TO EVOLVE TO SUIT THEIR NEEDS.
334,ep148,"(Judy) LIKE ANYTHING, AFTER YOU LIVE IN A SPACE FOR A WHILE, YOU FIND OUT THAT YOUR INITIAL IDEAS OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH IT TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LIVING IN IT."
335,ep148,"SO WHAT YOU THOUGHT WOULD BE GREAT AS A BEDROOM TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH LIGHT AND TOO MANY WINDOWS, TOO MUCH SOUND."
336,ep148,"(Suzanne) THE WALLACES HAVE KEPT RODNEY'S IDEA FOR A SECOND LEVEL, AND HAVE MADE SOME OF THEIR OWN MODIFICATIONS."
337,ep148,"INSTEAD OF A COMPUTER ROOM, THIS WILL BECOME THEIR NEW BEDROOM."
338,ep148,"BY PUTTING THE BEDROOM OVER BY THE OTHER WALL, WE FIND THAT IT'S DARKER, SO WE CAN SLEEP IN LONGER IF WE WANT TO."
339,ep148,"IT'S A LOT MORE QUIETER, BECAUSE IT IS INSULATED BY TWO SOLID WALLS, AS OPPOSED TO TWO WINDOW WALLS."
340,ep148,AND IT'S MORE OF LIKE A NOOK TYPE OF ATMOSPHERE.
341,ep148,IT'S BEEN QUITE ADVENTUROUS.
342,ep148,IT'S TAKEN US A LITTLE LONGER THAN WE ANTICIPATED IN ORDER TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION.
343,ep148,YEAH. WE WERE THINKING ABOUT RAISING THE BATHROOM.
344,ep148,"AND WE DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE, ONLY BECAUSE THE BEDROOM'S GOING TO BE ON THE SECOND LEVEL."
345,ep148,(Suzanne) ONE OF THE PERKS OF LIVING IN THIS BUILDING HAS BEEN THE SOCIAL SCENE.
346,ep148,BARRY AND JUDY ARE HOSTING A FRIDAY EVENING PARTY FOR SOME OF THEIR NEW NEIGHBORS.
347,ep148,SAMPLE THIS...
348,ep148,IT'S VERY NICE.
349,ep148,"OH, GOOD."
350,ep148,(Suzanne) MEETING LIKE-MINDED FRIENDS HAS GIVEN THE WALLACES A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE ON URBAN LIVING.
351,ep148,(Judy) YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TWO CITIES OVER OR EVEN TWO BLOCKS OVER.
352,ep148,"YOU HAVE FIFTY PEOPLE YOU CAN VISIT, YOU KNOW, WITHIN TWO MINUTES, WHICH IS GREAT."
353,ep148,(Barry) THIS TYPE OF LIVING HAS BEEN VERY...
354,ep148,(Judy) IT'S BEEN GREAT.
355,ep148,IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
356,ep148,IT'S ACTUALLY MORE SO THAN WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING.
357,ep148,"(Suzanne) AFTER EXPLORING ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS, JUDY AND BARRY HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE PERFECT HOME."
358,ep148,(Judy) I'M JUST IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE.
359,ep148,"I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS LOFT, I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS BUILDING, I'M IN LOVE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THIS BUILDING."
360,ep148,THE AREA TO ME IS JUST WONDERFUL.
361,ep148,"(Suzanne) BARRY AND JUDY WALLACE, LIVING THE LOFT LIFE AND LOVING IT."
362,ep148,FINDING THE PERFECT BLEND OF UNIQUE SPACE AND LOW MAINTENANCE WASN'T EASY.
363,ep148,"BUT AFTER ADDING THEIR OWN STYLISH TOUCHES TO THEIR DOWNTOWN LOFT, THE WALLACES FEEL AT HOME AT LAST."
364,ep148,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.

2,ep149,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep149,ROD AND MICHELLE EMELLE HAVE ENJOYED LIVING IN THE DUPLEX APARTMENT THEY SHARE WITH THEIR DAUGHTER MAYA.
4,ep149,BUT THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THE FACT THAT IT'S NO LONGER BIG ENOUGH FOR THE THREE OF THEM.
5,ep149,THE EMELLES' FIRST ATTEMPT AT HOUSE HUNTING ENDED IN FRUSTRATION.
6,ep149,NOW THE COUPLE HAS A NEW AGENT AND A NEW OUTLOOK.
7,ep149,ALL THEY NEED NOW IS A PERFECT NEW HOUSE.
8,ep149,IT'S ALL COMING UP NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
9,ep149,♪♪ ♪♪ (Suzanne) MICHELLE AND ROD EMELLE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY IN THE DUPLEX APARTMENT THAT THEY'RE RENTING.
10,ep149,"IT'S THE ONLY HOME THEY'VE KNOWN TOGETHER AS A FAMILY, AND WHILE LIVING HERE THEY'VE FORMED STRONG TIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD."
11,ep149,"WE LIVE IN A DUPLEX, BUT IT'S STILL LIKE A HOME."
12,ep149,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
13,ep149,AND I FEELS LIKE IT IS A HOME EVEN THOUGH WE ARE RENTING IT.
14,ep149,AND WE REALLY HAVE SOME GOOD MEMORIES HERE.
15,ep149,IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT.
16,ep149,"(Suzanne) PART OF WHAT HAS MADE IT GREAT, ARE THE FEATURES THEIR APARTMENT HAS, LIKE A ROOMY KITCHEN."
17,ep149,"(Michelle) WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE, I LOVED THE KITCHEN."
18,ep149,THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE FOR ROD AND I TO BOTH BE IN HERE AND KIND OF COOK TOGETHER AND ALSO I LOVE THE AMOUNT OF CABINETS AND CLOSET SPACE.
19,ep149,"(Suzanne) BUT ALL OF THOSE CLOSETS AND CABINETS ARE NOW FULL, AND WITH THEIR DAUGHTER MAYA GETTING OLDER, THE EMELLES HAVE SIMPLY OUTGROWN THIS WELL-LOVED HOME."
20,ep149,"PRESENTLY WE'RE IN A TWO BEDROOM, ONE BATH."
21,ep149,AND IT'S A SMALL DUPLEX.
22,ep149,"NOT THAT IT WASN'T NICE WHEN WE MOVED IN, BUT OVER TIME WE'VE AMASSED SOME THINGS, AND WE JUST FEEL WE WANT SOME MORE SPACE NOW."
23,ep149,(Suzanne) ROD AND MICHELLE ARE EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY READY TO MAKE THE JUMP TO HOME OWNERSHIP.
24,ep149,BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL BE EASY FOR THEM.
25,ep149,MANY FACTORS HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.
26,ep149,"EVEN MICHELLE'S WORK AS A HUMAN RESOURCE DIRECTOR, AND ROD'S WORK AS A WRITER EFFECT BOTH THE SIZE AND LOCATION OF ANY HOUSE THEY CHOOSE."
27,ep149,(Rob) WE BOTH WORK...
28,ep149,WE'RE COMMUTERS NOW.
29,ep149,"AND AS MUCH AS THE DISTANCE, EARLY ON, WAS OKAY ON OUR YOUNG BODIES, NOW WE'RE GETTING KIND OF TIRED WITH THE LONG COMMUTE."
30,ep149,AND ALSO WE NEED MORE SPACE...
31,ep149,WE NEED CLOSET SPACE.
32,ep149,WE NEED AN EXTRA BATHROOM ALSO.
33,ep149,WE REALLY NEED AN EXTRA BATHROOM.
34,ep149,WE DEFINITELY NEED AN EXTRA BEDROOM.
35,ep149,"(Rod) OUR BEDROOM IS OUR BEDROOM-SLASH-OFFICE, WHERE ONE MAY BE WORKING ON THE COMPUTER WHILE THE OTHER IS TRYING TO SLEEP."
36,ep149,AND YOU HEAR TICKA TICKA TICK ON THE KEYBOARD.
37,ep149,BUT WE REALLY NEED THAT EXTRA SPACE RIGHT THERE.
38,ep149,"ALL RIGHT, MAYA, IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO BED."
39,ep149,HERE'S YOUR WATER.
40,ep149,(Suzanne) MICHELLE AND ROD MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF THEIR FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.
41,ep149,"(Michelle) OUR DAUGHTER MAYA HAS A LOT OF ENERGY, SO WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN GETTING A BACKYARD FOR HER."
42,ep149,"RIGHT NOW SHE USUALLY UNWINDS BY READING A BOOK OR SOMETHING, BUT SHE CAN HAVE SOME PLAYTIME OUTSIDE IN THE EVENING."
43,ep149,NIGHT-NIGHT. ROD AND MICHELLE HAVE KNOWN THEY WANTED TO BUY A HOUSE FOR SOME TIME NOW.
44,ep149,BUT THEY WERE DISCOURAGED BY THE QUALITY OF THE HOUSES THEY WERE SHOWN AND BAFFLED BY THE COMPLICATED PAPERWORK.
45,ep149,THEY QUICKLY BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEIR EXPECTATIONS WERE UNREASONABLE.
46,ep149,"I MEAN, THIS IS NICE, BUT THE PRICE ISN'T."
47,ep149,(Suzanne) AND THEIR CHOICES WERE LIMITED.
48,ep149,THAT'S OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE.
49,ep149,(Rod) WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE THAT WE COULDN'T GET THE HOUSE THAT WE WANTED.
50,ep149,"AND IT CAME TO A POINT, WE STARTED THINKING WELL, MAYBE OUR STANDARDS ARE TOO HIGH, AND MAYBE WE NEED TO JUST STOP AND PUT SOME MORE MONEY ASIDE, TO GET WHAT WE WANT."
51,ep149,"BECAUSE WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT WE WERE SETTLING, AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR LESS."
52,ep149,"SO WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE JUST SAID, WHY DON'T WE JUST HOLD THIS HOUSE-BUYING THING OFF FOR A WHILE?"
53,ep149,"(Suzanne) FRUSTRATED, MICHELLE AND ROD HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP."
54,ep149,"BUT THEN A FRIEND SUGGESTED THEY CALL REALTOR TAMARA THOMAS, WHO BEGAN TO TURN THEIR HOUSE HUNTING EXPERIENCE AROUND."
55,ep149,(Michelle) WE TALKED ON THE PHONE FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS AND IT'S JUST BEEN A REALLY WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP SINCE THEN.
56,ep149,"WONDERFUL PERSON, AND SHE TAUGHT US SO MUCH ABOUT THE HOME-BUYING PROCESS."
57,ep149,(Suzanne) TAMARA HAS WORKED HARD TO EXPLAIN THE REAL ESTATE FINE PRINT.
58,ep149,"I'M NOT DICTATING, I'M EDUCATING THEM."
59,ep149,I WANT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS.
60,ep149,I WANT THEM TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
61,ep149,I WANT THEM TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR PURCHASE.
62,ep149,I WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY WITH THEIR PURCHASE.
63,ep149,AND I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.
64,ep149,(Suzanne) SHE'S ALSO HELPED THE EMELLES FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET MORE HOUSE FOR THEIR MONEY.
65,ep149,"AFTER WE SPOKE WITH THE LENDING AGENT THAT TAMARA REFERRED US TO, WE FOUND OUT THAT WE COULD QUALIFY AND GET INTO A MUCH BETTER HOUSE THAN ANY OF THE HOUSES THAT WE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT."
66,ep149,"(Suzanne) IN A MATTER OF DAYS, THE EMELLES WERE LOOKING AT HOMES IN NEIGHBORHOODS WERE THEY COULD SEE THEMSELVES LIVING."
67,ep149,"YOU KNOW, ROD, I REALLY LIKE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD."
68,ep149,IT'S REALLY GREAT.
69,ep149,"YEAH, I'M LIKING IT TOO."
70,ep149,IT'S REAL QUIET.
71,ep149,"YOU KNOW, IT'D BE NICE FOR MAYA TO PLAY."
72,ep149,I SAW SOME KIDS UP THE STREET.
73,ep149,"(Suzanne) NOW THIS COUPLE, WHO HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS, IS GETTING SOME POSITIVE ANSWERS."
74,ep149,NOW THEY TOO ARE FEELING POSITIVE.
75,ep149,"NOW THAT WE'VE FOUND TAMARA, I REALLY FEEL THAT WE'RE GONNA FIND THE HOME THAT WE WANT."
76,ep149,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, THE EMELLES ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN ROUND TWO IN THEIR HUNT FOR A HOUSE."
77,ep149,WILL IT END WITH A KNOCKOUT THIS TIME AROUND?
78,ep149,EVERYTHING'S BUILT-IN...
79,ep149,THAT'S SO WONDERFUL.
80,ep149,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
81,ep149,MICHELLE AND ROD EMELLE WERE ALL SET TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOUSE.
82,ep149,"BUT AS SOON AS THEY STARTED LOOKING, THEY HIT A ROADBLOCK."
83,ep149,"FINANCING, COUNTEROFFERS, ESCROW, INSPECTIONS, IT ALL SEEMED TERRIBLY COMPLICATED TO THIS YOUNG COUPLE."
84,ep149,"BUT NOW THAT MICHELLE AND ROD HAVE MET REALTOR TAMARA THOMAS, THOSE ROADBLOCKS SEEM TO HAVE DISAPPEARED."
85,ep149,"(Michelle) TAMARA, THIS IS A REALLY NICE NEIGHBORHOOD."
86,ep149,"YEAH, IT'S REAL QUIET."
87,ep149,YEAH IT IS...
88,ep149,NICE FAMILY AREA.
89,ep149,THAT'S GOOD.
90,ep149,(Suzanne) TAMARA ALSO HELPED THE EMELLES SECURE FINANCING THAT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO BEGIN LOOKING AT HOMES IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT THEY COULD NEVER AFFORD.
91,ep149,"THIS IS A THREE BEDROOM, TWO BATH."
92,ep149,THIS IS YOUR LIVING ROOM.
93,ep149,"(Suzanne) THIS HOME SEEMS PROMISING, AS IT MEETS THE EMELLES' MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF THREE BEDROOMS AND TWO BATHS."
94,ep149,(Michelle) IT'S GOT A NICE FIREPLACE.
95,ep149,"OKAY, YOU GUYS, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEDROOMS."
96,ep149,HMM... THE CLOSET?
97,ep149,OH HERE'S...
98,ep149,THE CLOSET IS OVER HERE.
99,ep149,"OH. TAMARA, THIS IS KIND OF SMALL."
100,ep149,OH... ME AND ROD THIS IS SMALL.
101,ep149,"YEAH. LET'S LOOK IN THE OTHER BEDROOMS, THE ROOM IS A NICE SIZE."
102,ep149,"BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE ROOMS AND MAYBE WE HAVE YES, OKAY."
103,ep149,MORE SPACE OR ACCOMMODATION IN THE OTHER ROOMS.
104,ep149,"OKAY. YOU GUYS, THIS IS THE OTHER BEDROOM, THE SMALLEST OF THE THREE."
105,ep149,HMM... PRETTY SMALL.
106,ep149,IT'S REAL SMALL.
107,ep149,AND AGAIN THE CLOSET...
108,ep149,I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT GUEST BEDROOM- SLASH-OFFICE.
109,ep149,AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN SET A BED AND A DESK IN HERE.
110,ep149,"YEAH. KNOW, IT'S KIND OF SMALL."
111,ep149,"RIGHT, WELL LET'S..."
112,ep149,"I LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THE HOUSE, KIND OF, THOUGH."
113,ep149,"OKAY, THIS IS THE KITCHEN."
114,ep149,HMM... SMALL.
115,ep149,"YEAH. NOT EVEN IN THE KITCHEN AS MUCH AS HER, BUT THIS IS KIND OF SMALL."
116,ep149,THE WHOLE HOUSE IS A LITTLE BIT SMALL FOR YOU GUYS.
117,ep149,YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.
118,ep149,NOT ENOUGH CLOSET SPACE...
119,ep149,"OKAY. THIS EARLY IN THEIR SEARCH, MICHELLE AND ROD AREN'T WILLING TO COMPROMISE ON WHAT THEY WANT, AND TAMARA ASSURES THEM THAT THEIR PERFECT HOUSE IS OUT THERE."
120,ep149,"SO THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND THE TRIO HITS THE STREETS AGAIN, CONFIDENT THAT EVERY HOUSE THEY SEE WILL BRING THEM CLOSER TO THEIR GOAL."
121,ep149,"IF THE INSIDE LOOKS LIKE THE EXTERIOR, YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING HERE."
122,ep149,"YEAH, THIS IS A NICE HOUSE."
123,ep149,"OKAY, MICHELLE, WOW."
124,ep149,"OH MY GOD, YOU HAVE A NICE, ISOLATED LIVING ROOM HERE."
125,ep149,THIS IS NICE.
126,ep149,THIS IS MUCH DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THAT WE'VE SEEN.
127,ep149,I'M DIGGING THIS...
128,ep149,I'M DIGGING THIS.
129,ep149,"YOU LIKE THIS, ROD?"
130,ep149,YEAH. I DID GOOD.
131,ep149,YOU DID DO GOOD.
132,ep149,"OKAY, LET'S GO LOOK AT THE NEXT ROOM."
133,ep149,"OKAY. ROD AND MICHELLE, THIS IS THE ROOM THAT I WAS TELLING YOU GUYS COULD BE YOUR FORMAL DINING ROOM OR A FAMILY ROOM."
134,ep149,YOU HAVE A NICE FIREPLACE HERE.
135,ep149,(Rod) IT'S NICE.
136,ep149,I THINK IT'S A NICE ROOM.
137,ep149,ISN'T THIS A GREAT KITCHEN?
138,ep149,WOW! NEW CABINETS.
139,ep149,THIS IS NICE.
140,ep149,"THIS IS REALLY, REALLY NICE."
141,ep149,NICE BUILT-INS.
142,ep149,"AND HERE, ROD AND MICHELLE, YOU HAVE YOUR LAUNDRY AREA FOR YOUR WASHER AND DRYER."
143,ep149,YOU'VE GOT CABINET SPACE OVER THE TOP OF THE WASHER AND DRYER.
144,ep149,"YES, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR, TAMARA, SPACE..."
145,ep149,CONVENIENCE TOO.
146,ep149,WASHER AND DRYER TOO...
147,ep149,THAT'S COOL.
148,ep149,THIS IS NICE.
149,ep149,AND EVERYTHING'S BUILT-IN.
150,ep149,THAT'S SO WONDERFUL.
151,ep149,"YEAH, YOU HAVE A DISHWASHER, YOUR OVEN AND YOUR STOVE."
152,ep149,THAT'S GREAT.
153,ep149,BATHROOM. THE BATHROOM'S NICE.
154,ep149,THIS IS REAL NICE.
155,ep149,"THE ONE DRAWBACK WITH THIS HOUSE IS THAT IT HAS ONLY ONE BATHROOM, BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BATHROOM."
156,ep149,OUCH. BEAUTIFUL...
157,ep149,"I LIKE THE TILE, I LIKE THE MIRROR, BUT..."
158,ep149,WE NEED ANOTHER ONE.
159,ep149,WE JUST NEED ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT.
160,ep149,"YEAH. AS THEY LOOK AT MORE AND MORE HOMES, ROD AND MICHELLE WILL BEGIN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CONVENIENCES AND ESSENTIALS."
161,ep149,"IN THIS CASE, TWO BATHROOMS ARE A DEFINITE ESSENTIAL."
162,ep149,"OKAY, ROD AND MICHELLE, SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THAT ONE?"
163,ep149,IT WAS NICE.
164,ep149,BUT WE NEED TWO BATHROOMS.
165,ep149,BUT THIS PLACE IS MOSTLY...
166,ep149,IS VERY MUCH IN THE BALLPARK OF WHAT WE NEED.
167,ep149,"(Suzanne) THE EMELLES REALIZE THAT THE MORE FAMILIAR TAMARA BECOMES WITH THEIR NEEDS, THE FASTER SHE CAN FIND THEM THE PERFECT HOUSE."
168,ep149,"SO IN AN EFFORT TO FINE-TUNE THEIR SEARCH, MICHELLE AND ROD EXTEND A DINNER INVITATION TO THEIR REALTOR AND NEW FRIEND."
169,ep149,SEEING MICHELLE AND ROD'S CURRENT HOME FOR HERSELF WILL GIVE TAMARA A BETTER IDEA ABOUT THEIR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
170,ep149,"SO MICHELLE, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME AROUND, SO I CAN SEE THE SIZE OF YOUR BEDROOMS NOW, AND SEE THE SIZE OF YOUR FURNITURE, AND THAT WILL KIND OF HELP ME WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR PLACES FOR YOU."
171,ep149,"OKAY, COME THIS WAY."
172,ep149,"AND TAMARA, THIS IS OUR BATHROOM."
173,ep149,OKAY. IS OUR LOVELY HALLWAY.
174,ep149,"SEE, I HAVE A LOT OF CLOSETS."
175,ep149,"OKAY. PLACE IS SMALL, BUT IT HAS A LOT OF CLOSETS AND CABINETS."
176,ep149,"RIGHT. TAMARA, THIS IS MY LIVING ROOM- SLASH-EXERCISE ROOM- SLASH LIBRARY- SLASH..."
177,ep149,"ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST A MULTIPURPOSE ROOM."
178,ep149,WE DO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN HERE.
179,ep149,"SO IT SOUNDS TO ME, MICHELLE, LIKE YOU NEED THREE OR FOUR ROOMS."
180,ep149,"YES, DEFINITELY."
181,ep149,OKAY. IS OUR BEDROOM.
182,ep149,"BEDROOM-SLASH OFFICE, I SEE."
183,ep149,YES. SEE ALL THE COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND THE FILE CABINET.
184,ep149,RIGHT. JUST A REAL SMALL SPACE THAT WE PUT A LOT INTO.
185,ep149,YOU READY TO EAT?
186,ep149,"SURE. ON, LET'S GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT."
187,ep149,"(Suzanne) SITTING DOWN TO DINNER GIVES TAMARA, ROD AND MICHELLE A CHANCE TO RELAX AND ENJOY THEMSELVES."
188,ep149,BUT IT ALSO GIVES ROD AND MICHELLE AN ADDED OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THEIR PRIORITIES FOR TAMARA AND EVEN FOR THEMSELVES.
189,ep149,"SO ANOTHER ISSUE WAS, YOU GUYS WANTED MOVE-IN CONDITION."
190,ep149,YES. WAS REALLY IMPORTANT.
191,ep149,'CAUSE I'M NOT A HANDYMAN.
192,ep149,"BUT WE'RE WILLING TO PUT IN CARPET, A LITTLE BIT OF CARPET."
193,ep149,"AND WE WANT TO HAVE A NICE-SIZED BACKYARD, SO MAYBE WE COULD PUT A SWING IN FOR MAYA."
194,ep149,"RIGHT, OKAY."
195,ep149,"NICE SIZE, BECAUSE I WANT DOGS."
196,ep149,NO. DOGS.
197,ep149,WE'LL TALK.
198,ep149,(Suzanne) SOMETIMES A FIRST HOUSE CAN'T HAVE EVERY ITEM ON THE BUYERS' WISH LIST.
199,ep149,TAMARA'S JOB IS TO HELP MICHELLE AND ROD DECIDE WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE.
200,ep149,"YOU KNOW, WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK FOR IS AN UPGRADED KITCHEN, DECENT BATHROOMS, AND SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS WOULD JUST HAVE TO MAYBE PAINT AND PUT CARPET IN."
201,ep149,SO TAKE OUT THE CARPET AND HAVE THE FLOORS REVARNISHED.
202,ep149,RIGHT. THEY END THE EVENING MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
203,ep149,"I MYSELF WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE SEEING IN THE BEGINNING BEFORE WE MET YOU, BUT NOW WE'RE THERE, I THINK."
204,ep149,"AT LEAST, WE'RE GETTING THERE."
205,ep149,THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING OUT THERE FOR YOU GUYS.
206,ep149,IT'S JUST WE HAVE TO FIND IT.
207,ep149,OKAY. IS THE EMELLES' LUCK ABOUT TO CHANGE?
208,ep149,"THREE, OH, MAN."
209,ep149,"OH, THREE BATHROOMS, THIS IS NICE."
210,ep149,(Suzanne) OR IS IT JUST MORE FRUSTRATION AHEAD?
211,ep149,(Rod) THIS IVY KIND OF CONCERNS ME.
212,ep149,(Suzanne) FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
213,ep149,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.

217,ep149,THE YOUNG FAMILY IS NOW CONVINCED THAT THEIR PERFECT HOME IS JUST AROUND THE BEND.
218,ep149,(Tamara) I REALLY THINK THAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LIKE THIS HOUSE.
219,ep149,(Suzanne) TODAY TAMARA IS SHOWING THE FAMILY A HOME SHE THINKS IS PERFECT FOR THEM.
220,ep149,"THE HOUSE JUST WENT ON THE MARKET YESTERDAY, SO MICHELLE AND ROD AND THEIR YOUNG DAUGHTER MAYA ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GET A TOUR."
221,ep149,"OH, MICHELLE, LOOK AT THE HARDWOOD FLOORS."

233,ep149,"YEAH, IT'LL FIT IN HERE NICELY."
234,ep149,"OKAY, COME ON, LET'S GO INTO THE KITCHEN."
235,ep149,"HERE YOU HAVE A NICE KITCHEN, MICHELLE."

243,ep149,"MAYA, ARE YOU OKAY OUT THERE?"
244,ep149,"(Suzanne) WHILE HER PARENTS CONTINUE THEIR TOUR, MAYA INVESTIGATES THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE HOUSE, THE BACKYARD PLAY AREA."
245,ep149,THIS IS A REALLY NICE ROOM.
246,ep149,NOW LOOK AT THIS WINDOW.
247,ep149,"OH, YEAH."
248,ep149,"OH, MAN."
249,ep149,THAT WILL BE NICE TO PUT A WINDOW SEAT THERE.
250,ep149,"YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
251,ep149,BEAUTIFUL HARDWOOD FLOORS...
252,ep149,THEY DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE DONE.
253,ep149,"OKAY, THERE'S THREE BEDROOMS WITH A FAMILY ROOM, AND IT HAS 1,873 SQUARE FEET."
254,ep149,GOOD. REALLY A NICE-SIZED HOUSE AND ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE GOING TO BE NICE-SIZED TOO.
255,ep149,"YEAH, YOU KNOW, TAMARA, WERE STILL A LITTLE WORRIED, THOUGH, ABOUT BEING ON A BUSY STREET."
256,ep149,"YEAH, BUT YOU NOTICE, WE'RE RIGHT HERE BY THIS WINDOW AND YOU CAN'T HEAR ANY NOISE ANY TRAFFIC."
257,ep149,"YEAH, IT IS MINIMAL."
258,ep149,"I LIKE THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE, I LIKE THE SIZE OF THE ROOMS."
259,ep149,LET'S WALK AROUND...
260,ep149,WE'RE NOT FINISHED LOOKING.
261,ep149,"BECAUSE AS FAR AS MAYA, YOU COULD ALWAYS..."
262,ep149,SHE COULD PLAY IN THE BACKYARD.
263,ep149,SHE WON'T BE PLAYING IN THE FRONT ANYWAY.
264,ep149,TRUE. TRUE.
265,ep149,SHE LIKES PLAYING IN THE BACKYARD.
266,ep149,HERE'S ONE OF THE THREE BATHROOMS.
267,ep149,THREE! THREE BATHROOMS!
268,ep149,"OH, MAN."
269,ep149,THIS IS NICE.

275,ep149,IT'S A NICE BATHROOM.

278,ep149,THIS IS...
279,ep149,"OH, LOOK AT THIS BEDROOM."
280,ep149,WOW. IS NICE.
281,ep149,"MAN! MY GOD, THE VAULTED CEILINGS."
282,ep149,"WOW, LOOK AT THE CLOSETS."
283,ep149,MAN. BIG CLOSETS.
284,ep149,"OH, THIS IS SO COOL."
285,ep149,CLOSET SPACE.
286,ep149,"NOW THIS IS THE TYPE OF CLOSET SPACE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR, TAMARA."
287,ep149,"WELL, YOU GUYS SAID YOU WANTED CLOSET SPACE."
288,ep149,YES. PLENTY OF IT.
289,ep149,PLENTY OF IT.
290,ep149,"YEAH. DIFFERENT CLOSETS, THERE'S SEPARATE CLOSETS."
291,ep149,"THIS IS A WINNER, TAMARA, WE LIKE THIS ONE."
292,ep149,YOU LIKE THIS ONE?
293,ep149,"WHAT ABOUT THE STREET, THE BUSY STREET?"
294,ep149,I THINK THIS...
295,ep149,"WELL, BACK HERE, YOU CAN'T HERE IT."
296,ep149,I THINK THIS MAKES UP FOR THE BUSY STREET.
297,ep149,THIS MAKES UP FOR THE BUSY STREET.
298,ep149,"OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THOSE WINDOWS."
299,ep149,"(Suzanne) ALL THAT CLOSET SPACE AND THE VAULTED CEILINGS ARE GREAT, BUT ROD HAS HAD HIS EYE ON THIS LOFT SINCE HE FIRST WALKED IN THE ROOM."
300,ep149,"(Michelle) HEY, BABY, YOU LIKE IT UP THERE?"
301,ep149,"OH, YES."
302,ep149,THAT WILL BE A GREAT SPACE FOR YOUR OFFICE.
303,ep149,"PERFECT, IT'S MINE..."
304,ep149,SQUATTER'S RIGHTS.
305,ep149,"OH, LOOK, ROD..."
306,ep149,YOU CAN SEE THE BACKYARD FROM THIS ROOM.
307,ep149,"YEAH, A NICE BREEZE COMING THROUGH ON A NICE DAY."
308,ep149,THIS IS NICE...
309,ep149,THIS IS REALLY NICE.
310,ep149,"OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?"
311,ep149,I LIKE IT...
312,ep149,I LIKE IT.
313,ep149,I'M STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE MAJOR STREET.
314,ep149,MAJOR STREET.
315,ep149,(Suzanne) THIS IS THE HARD PART.
316,ep149,THE HOUSE DOES FACE A BUSY THOROUGHFARE.
317,ep149,"BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS ABOUT THE HOME THAT ROD AND MICHELLE LOVE-- THE HUGE MASTER SUITE, THE SPACIOUS KITCHEN, AND THE THREE BATHROOMS."
318,ep149,IT'S A GREAT HOUSE.
319,ep149,IT IS.
320,ep149,"I REALLY THINK IF YOU GUYS ARE INTERESTED AND YOU WANT IT, WE NEED TO MOVE ON IT RIGHT AWAY."
321,ep149,YOU KNOW WHAT THE MARKET'S DOING RIGHT NOW.
322,ep149,OKAY. GIVE US A MINUTE.
323,ep149,LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
324,ep149,LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
325,ep149,"ALL RIGHT, LET ME KNOW."
326,ep149,"(Suzanne) AND A MINUTE IS ALL IT TAKES FOR MICHELLE AND ROD TO DECIDE TO MAKE AN OFFER ON THE HOUSE, WHICH HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED AND THEN SOME."
327,ep149,"THIS IS A REALLY NICE HOUSE, TAMARA."
328,ep149,"I LIKE THIS, TAMARA."
329,ep149,"GOOD, GOOD..."
330,ep149,"I TELL YOU, WITH IT SITTING BACK OFF THE STREET, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HEAR THE NOISE FROM THE STREET."
331,ep149,YOU DON'T.
332,ep149,"I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT, BUT THIS HOUSE MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE."
333,ep149,"(Suzanne) THE EMELLES ARE RELIEVED TO FINALLY MAKE AN OFFER ON A HOME THEY KNOW THEY'LL LOVE, BUT THEY STILL HAVE AN ANXIOUS WAITING PERIOD AHEAD OF THEM."
334,ep149,WILL MICHELLE AND ROD'S OFFER BE ACCEPTED?
335,ep149,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS CONTINUES.
336,ep149,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
337,ep149,"AFTER A LONG, HARD SEARCH, ROD AND MICHELLE EMELLE HAVE FINALLY FOUND A HOUSE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME."
338,ep149,"THEY MADE AN OFFER, THE SELLERS MADE A COUNTEROFFER, AND NOW THREE DAYS LATER, THIS ANXIOUS COUPLE IS WAITING TO SEE IF THEIR FINAL OFFER HAS BEEN ACCEPTED."
339,ep149,"TAMARA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THIS LATE?"
340,ep149,"OH, MY GOODNESS."
341,ep149,I CAME OVER TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT WE GOT AN ACCEPTED OFFER.
342,ep149,WOO! MY GOD!
343,ep149,"WOO! MY GOD, WE GOT THE HOUSE."
344,ep149,"(Suzanne) THE GOOD NEWS IS DELIVERED BY THE EMELLES' REALTOR, TAMARA THOMAS, WHO KEPT MICHELLE AND ROD FROM GIVING UP, THEN HELPED THEM SEARCH FIFTEEN HOMES, INTERVIEW FOUR DIFFERENT LENDERS AND NEGOTIATE THREE OFFERS BEFORE THE CELEBRATION COULD BEGIN."
345,ep149,YAY. DESERVE THIS.
346,ep149,"HERE YOU GO, TAMARA, THIS IS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK."
347,ep149,THANK YOU.
348,ep149,"HERE YOU GO, HONEY."
349,ep149,"ALL MY HARD WORK, GIMME, GIMME."
350,ep149,THERE YOU GO.
351,ep149,TO OUR NEW HOUSE.
352,ep149,"(Suzanne) AFTER SWITCHING REALTORS, CHANGING NEIGHBORHOODS, INCREASING THEIR BUDGET AND NEARLY GIVING UP ENTIRELY, THE EMELLE FAMILY FINALLY GOT THAT ONE PERFECT HOME."
353,ep149,"BUT BEFORE THEY CAN ENJOY THEIR NEW HOUSE, THE MUST SURVIVE MOVING DAY."
354,ep149,AND IT'S GOT THE WHOLE FAMILY INVOLVED.
355,ep149,"(Maya) MOM, CAN I HELP YOU?"
356,ep149,"YES, YOU CAN HELP ME."
357,ep149,YOU HAVE TO FOLD THIS UP.
358,ep149,(Suzanne) EVEN THEIR FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MAYA OFFERS HER ASSISTANCE.
359,ep149,GOOD JOB.
360,ep149,"(Suzanne) AND ALTHOUGH FURNITURE CAN BE PACKED UP AND TAKEN ALONG, NEIGHBORS CANNOT."
361,ep149,"HI, PAT."
362,ep149,"HI, MICHELLE."
363,ep149,HOW YOU DOING?
364,ep149,"YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE, RIGHT?"
365,ep149,"YEAH, WE'RE GETTING READY..."
366,ep149,WE'RE PACKING UP.
367,ep149,THESE ARE THE LAST LITTLE BOXES.
368,ep149,WELCOME TO THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
369,ep149,YOU'RE WELCOME.
370,ep149,IT'S BEEN GREAT STAYING HERE.
371,ep149,YEAH. HAVE TO COME AND SEE YOU GUYS.

373,ep149,"OKAY, OKAY."
374,ep149,"I'LL SEE YOU, THOUGH."
375,ep149,"OKAY, BYE."
376,ep149,"BYE-BYE. ACROSS TOWN AT THE NEW HOUSE, THINGS ARE NO LESS HECTIC."
377,ep149,WOO... IS GROUNDS FOR A DIVORCE.
378,ep149,I LOVE YOU.
379,ep149,"YEAH, RIGHT."
380,ep149,MAKE SURE YOU WIPE YOUR FEET.
381,ep149,ALWAYS. DOES THIS GO?
382,ep149,"YOU DIDN'T LABLE THE BOXES, DID YOU?"
383,ep149,"OH, LEAVE ME."
384,ep149,"(Suzanne) THE HOUSE IS QUICKLY FILLING UP, BUT ALL THIS NEW SPACE WILL TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO."
385,ep149,WHAT WAS THAT ROOM?
386,ep149,THAT'S THE GUEST ROOM.
387,ep149,WE'RE HAVING GUESTS?
388,ep149,YES. THEIR FIRST GUEST ARRIVES SOONER THAN THEY THINK.
389,ep149,(knocking on door) WHO IS IT?

394,ep149,THIS IS SO NICE.
395,ep149,THANK YOU...
396,ep149,THANK YOU SO MUCH.
397,ep149,IT LOOKS GREAT.
398,ep149,"OH, MY GOD."
399,ep149,LOOK HOW IT'S...
400,ep149,"ROD AND MICHELLE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME REPRESENT YOU IN THE PURCHASE OF YOUR NEW HOME."
401,ep149,IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE DEALING WITH YOU.

1,ep150,HOUSE HUNTERS.
2,ep150,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep150,JAY AND DANIELLE WILLIAMS ARE ON A MISSION TO FIND THE PERFECT HOUSE.
4,ep150,"THESE ANXIOUS FIRST-TIME BUYERS HAVE A LONG LIST OF HOUSING NEEDS, BUT THEY'RE SHORT ON FUNDS TO BACK IT UP."
5,ep150,NOW THEY'RE FACED WITH THE ETERNAL HOUSING DILEMMA-- HOW TO GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT IN A HOME FOR THE BUDGET THEY'VE GOT.
6,ep150,THEY'LL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
7,ep150,♪♪ THIS ONE'S TWO STORIES.
8,ep150,YEAH... NEAR SCHOOLS.
9,ep150,WHERE IS THAT?
10,ep150,IT'S NEAR SCHOOLS.
11,ep150,WHERE IS THAT?
12,ep150,WHERE IS THAT?
13,ep150,(Suzanne) NEWLYWEDS DANIELLE AND JAY WILLIAMS HAVE OUTGROWN THE SPACE IN THEIR RENTED APARTMENT.
14,ep150,(Danielle) WE LIVE IN A SMALL SPLIT-LEVEL CONDOMINIUM.
15,ep150,"IT'S VERY NICE, BUT WE'RE REALLY EXPANDING OUT OF IT, RAPIDLY."
16,ep150,"(Jay) FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, WE'VE BEEN MOVING FROM APARTMENT TO APARTMENT AND STEADILY BEEN INCREASING IN SIZE, BECAUSE WE'RE JUST ACCUMULATING SO MUCH STUFF IN OUR LIVES."
17,ep150,AND WE'VE REALLY REACHED A POINT WHERE WE NEED MORE.
18,ep150,MY KITCHEN IS WAY TOO SMALL.
19,ep150,I CAN'T WORK IN THERE--IT'S MISERABLE.
20,ep150,WHAT THE OFFICE HAS SORT OF BECOME IS THE OFFICE UNDER THE STAIRS.
21,ep150,IT'S SORT OF THIS LITTLE NOOK WHERE WE'VE HAD TO PILE THINGS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER JUST TO KEEP EVERYTHING ORGANIZED.
22,ep150,"(Suzanne) EVEN THOUGH IT'S TOO SMALL, THERE ARE THINGS THAT JAY AND DANIELLE REALLY LIKE ABOUT THEIR CURRENT PLACE."
23,ep150,"FOR INSTANCE, THE WILLIAMS LOVE THE GENEROUS SIZE OF THEIR MASTER BEDROOM."
24,ep150,"(Danielle) WE LIKE THE FACT THAT IT HAS TWO STORIES, SO WE COULD SEPARATE OUR PRIVATE SPACE FROM OUR PUBLIC SPACE DOWNSTAIRS."
25,ep150,(Jay) STAIRS HAVE BEEN REALLY A NICE THING TO HAVE.
26,ep150,"I MEAN, WE HAVE THIS CUTE LITTLE PHRASE THAT WE SAID, WHERE I WOULD WALK IN THE DOOR..."
27,ep150,AND I WOULD SAY...
28,ep150,AND I WOULD SAY...
29,ep150,"I'D SAY, HONEY, I'M HOME!"
30,ep150,"I'D SAY, HONEY, I'M HOME!"
31,ep150,"AND I WOULD SAY, I'M UPSTAIRS!"
32,ep150,THAT WAS THE CHEESY REASON THAT WE PICKED THIS PLACE.
33,ep150,"(Suzanne) BUT THEIR PLACE IS FILLED TO CAPACITY, SO DANIELLE AND JAY HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE THE PLUNGE AND BUY THEIR FIRST HOME."
34,ep150,"THEY ARE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT IN A HOUSE, AND THEY'RE MOTIVATED TO MAKE SURE THEIR HOME BUYING EXPERIENCE IS AS ORGANIZED AS POSSIBLE."
35,ep150,WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO YOU?
36,ep150,SECURITY... AGREE.
37,ep150,I AGREE.
38,ep150,"THAT WOULD BE MINE, TOO."
39,ep150,"THAT WOULD BE MINE, TOO."
40,ep150,FINDING SOMEPLACE SAFE.
41,ep150,FINDING SOMEPLACE SAFE.
42,ep150,"(Danielle) WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A LIST OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED, SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WALK INTO A HOME AND FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMETHING SILLY THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY RELEVANCE TO WHAT WE NEEDED."
43,ep150,"YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT MY SECOND THING IS."
44,ep150,"YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT MY SECOND THING IS."
45,ep150,KITCHEN. NEED A NICE SIZE KITCHEN.
46,ep150,YEAH... NEED A NICE SIZE KITCHEN.
47,ep150,"WELL, IF YOU WANT A NICE KITCHEN, WELL, IF YOU WANT A NICE KITCHEN, THEN I WANT A NICE BATHROOM."
48,ep150,THEN I WANT A NICE BATHROOM.
49,ep150,WHAT DO YOU NEED IN YOUR BATHROOM...
50,ep150,WHAT DO YOU NEED IN YOUR BATHROOM...
51,ep150,NICE WORKABLE SPACE?
52,ep150,NICE WORKABLE SPACE?
53,ep150,JUST A NICE WORKABLE SPACE.
54,ep150,JUST A NICE WORKABLE SPACE.
55,ep150,(Suzanne) THE COUPLE MAKES A WISH LIST OF WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR NEW HOME.
56,ep150,"TOPPING THEIR LIST IS A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT DANIELLE IS ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING SOME OUTDOOR LIVING SPACE."
57,ep150,"THE COUPLE'S CURRENT APARTMENT HAS A SMALL PATIO, BUT DANIELLE WOULD LOVE A TRUE BACKYARD FOR GARDENING."
58,ep150,JAY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER BENEFIT OF OWNING A HOME.
59,ep150,"(Jay) I HAVE A NEW CAR, AND SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE A GARAGE."
60,ep150,(Suzanne) HAVING TO WASH HIS CAR IN THE STREET IS ANOTHER HASSLE THAT JAY WOULDN'T MIND GIVING UP.
61,ep150,"OKAY, THIS IS A TWO-STORY HOUSE."
62,ep150,"OKAY, THIS IS A TWO-STORY HOUSE."
63,ep150,OKAY... HAS FRUIT TREES.
64,ep150,BACKYARD HAS FRUIT TREES.
65,ep150,THAT SOUNDS REALLY NICE.
66,ep150,THAT SOUNDS REALLY NICE.
67,ep150,WE SHOULD GO LOOK A THAT.
68,ep150,WE SHOULD GO LOOK A THAT.
69,ep150,"OKAY. JAY AND DANIELLE ARE A YOUNG COUPLE WITH A LONG LIST OF NECESSITIES, BUT A SHORT SUPPLY OF FUNDS."
70,ep150,THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGE WILL BE FINDING A COMFORTABLE HOME WITH A COMFORTABLE MORTGAGE PAYMENT.
71,ep150,"BUT LIVING ON THE WEST COAST WHERE REAL ESTATE DOESN'T COME CHEAP, JAY AND DANIELLE WILL HAVE TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHAT KIND OF HOME THEY CAN GET FOR THEIR MONEY."
72,ep150,ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE REALLY HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DO IS OVEREXTEND OURSELVES AND JUST SORT OF REALIZE THAT WE HAVE LIMITS.
73,ep150,"(Suzanne) WITH THEIR RESEARCH DONE, A PRICE LIMIT SET AND THEIR WISH LIST SOLID, DANIELLE AND JAY ARE READY TO START LOOKING AT HOMES."
74,ep150,"(Jay) IN A WAY, IT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING JUST A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY."
75,ep150,"WE THINK IT SHOULD BE A FAIRLY LONG- TERM INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO GET OUR MONEY BACK OUT OF IT, SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE WE CAN STAY AT LEAST TEN YEARS."
76,ep150,"YEAH. EXCITING, BUT IT'S SCARY."
77,ep150,"IT'S EXCITING, BUT IT'S SCARY."
78,ep150,"(Suzanne) UP NEXT, JAY AND DANIELLE FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH HOUSE THEY CAN GET FOR THEIR MONEY, AND THE REALITY OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET HITS THIS YOUNG COUPLE HARD, WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS."
79,ep150,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
80,ep150,DANIELLE AND JAY WILLIAMS ARE READY TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO APARTMENT LIVING.
81,ep150,"BUT LIVING, AS THEY DO, IN A CITY WHERE REAL ESTATE IS NOTORIOUSLY EXPENSIVE, DANIELLE AND JAY ARE UNCERTAIN WHAT THEY WILL FIND AVAILABLE IN THEIR PRICE RANGE."
82,ep150,"ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR SEARCH, THESE FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS HAVE CALLED ON JAY'S PARENTS, WHO ARE VISITING FROM THE MIDWEST, TO HELP THEM BEGIN THEIR HUNT FOR A HOUSE."
83,ep150,WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO COMING AND SEEING ALL THESE HOMES AND...
84,ep150,AND... HOPE YOU LIKE 'EM.
85,ep150,I HOPE YOU LIKE 'EM.
86,ep150,HAVE SOME BIGGER ROOM TO STAY IN.
87,ep150,HERE COMES OUR BED!
88,ep150,"(Suzanne) BUT AS HAPPY AS THE COUPLE IS TO HAVE GUESTS, IT BRINGS THEIR LACK OF SPACE INTO SHARP FOCUS."
89,ep150,(Jay) WE'VE HAD TO THROW THE FUTON OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO STAY.
90,ep150,(Mom) OKAY...
91,ep150,"WELL, WE'RE EXCITED."
92,ep150,"WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT HOMES FOR A LONG TIME, SO IT'LL BE FUN FOR US."
93,ep150,"(Danielle) WELL, YOU CAN GIVE US SOME HELP, SOME ADVICE."
94,ep150,I'D LIKE A GUEST ROOM.
95,ep150,I'D LIKE A GUEST ROOM.
96,ep150,SO WOULD WE.
97,ep150,SO WOULD WE.
98,ep150,(Suzanne) HAVING VISITORS COMPELS JAY AND DANIELLE TO ADD A COMFORTABLE GUEST ROOM TO THEIR WISH LIST.
99,ep150,"THE NEXT MORNING, THE WILLIAMS HIT THE STREETS AND SET OUT TO DO SOME SERIOUS HOUSE HUNTING."
100,ep150,REALTOR TERRY FORD HAS SIGNED ON TO HELP JAY AND DANIELLE FIND THE BEST HOUSE THEIR MONEY CAN BUY.
101,ep150,"I WANNA FIND JAY AND DANIELLE THE HOUSE THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE COMFORTABLE IN, THAT THEY LIKE, THAT MEETS ALL OF THEIR CRITERIA."
102,ep150,"BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY WANNA SPEND, IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR."
103,ep150,"NOW THIS HOUSE, AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE OUTSIDE, NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK."
104,ep150,"(Jay) A FRESH COAT OF PAINT, MAYBE..."
105,ep150,"YEAH. IT NEEDS WORK ON THE INSIDE, BUT IT IS A NICE LITTLE STREET."
106,ep150,"I MEAN, YOU COULD RIDE YOUR BIKES TO THE BEACH FROM HERE."
107,ep150,SO COME ON IN.
108,ep150,"WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THE INSIDE OF THIS ONE."
109,ep150,"YOU CAN SEE THE INSIDE NEEDS ALMOST AS MUCH WORK, IF NOT MORE, THAN THE OUTSIDE."
110,ep150,"(Mom) I DON'T KNOW, KIDS."
111,ep150,"(Mom) I DON'T KNOW, KIDS."
112,ep150,(Jay) I DON'T KNOW.
113,ep150,(Jay) I DON'T KNOW.
114,ep150,"I KIND OF LIKE THE CEILINGS, I MEAN..."
115,ep150,(Danielle) LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
116,ep150,"(Terry) WELL, LET'S GO IN AND LOOK AT THE KITCHEN."
117,ep150,"WOW, IT DOES NEED WORK..."
118,ep150,DOESN'T IT?
119,ep150,(Jay) YEAH.
120,ep150,(Jay) YEAH.
121,ep150,"(Mom) OH, MY GOSH!"
122,ep150,"(Mom) OH, MY GOSH!"
123,ep150,"(Suzanne) NOT WANTING A FIXER-UPPER, JAY AND DANIELLE ARE LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS HOUSE."
124,ep150,NICE PLUMBING.
125,ep150,"(Suzanne) BECAUSE THIS HOUSE HAPPENS TO BE NEAR THE BEACH, THE ASKING PRICE IS PUSHING THE LIMITS OF THEIR BUDGET."
126,ep150,"(Mom) I DON'T KNOW, TERRY."
127,ep150,IS THIS ALL WE'RE GONNA GET FOR THIS MONEY?
128,ep150,IS THIS ALL WE'RE GONNA GET FOR THIS MONEY?
129,ep150,I KNOW.
130,ep150,I KNOW.
131,ep150,"WELL, YOU KNOW, IN THIS AREA, WHEN YOU'RE THIS CLOSE TO THE WATER, THE PRICES GO UP."
132,ep150,"BUT DON'T GET DISCOURAGED, WE WILL FIND YOU A PLACE."
133,ep150,ALL RIGHT?
134,ep150,(Suzanne) AND THE NEXT HOME DOES SHOW A LOT OF PROMISE...
135,ep150,OR AT LEAST IT WILL ONCE CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE.
136,ep150,"(Terry) USUALLY ON NEW CONSTRUCTION, THEY WILL BE LANDSCAPING THE WHOLE FRONT YARD AND THE BACKYARD."
137,ep150,(Danielle) IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD HAVE SOME SAY IN?
138,ep150,YES... COULD ALWAYS WRITE THAT IN THAT YOU WANT SOME SAY.
139,ep150,AND IT HAS A NICE TWO-CAR GARAGE.
140,ep150,ONE THING ABOUT THIS IS IT DOES HAVE A SEPARATE DEN FROM THE LIVING ROOM.
141,ep150,LET'S COME ON IN AND LOOK AT THE INSIDE.
142,ep150,ONE THING GREAT ABOUT NEW CONSTRUCTION IS YOU CAN PICK OUT YOUR OWN COLORS OF PAINT AND YOUR CARPET.
143,ep150,"YOU COULD PUT HARDWOODS IN, IF YOU WANTED."
144,ep150,"(Mom) DON'T FORGET TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS, (Mom) DON'T FORGET TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS, RIGHT."
145,ep150,RIGHT. THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT.
146,ep150,(Terry) YEAH...
147,ep150,THERE ARE APARTMENT BUILDINGS NEXT DOOR AND ACROSS THE STREET.
148,ep150,"WELL, LET'S JUST GO ON AND LOOK AT THE REST OF THE HOUSE."
149,ep150,THIS HAS A SEPARATE FAMILY ROOM AND LIVING ROOM.
150,ep150,LOOK AT THIS...
151,ep150,LOOK AT THE MASTER.
152,ep150,AND HERE WE HAVE THE MASTER BATH.
153,ep150,SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SIZE?
154,ep150,(Jay) IT'S A NICE BATH.
155,ep150,THEY'LL PROBABLY PUT A REALLY BIG TUB IN THERE.
156,ep150,BUT IT'S GOT THE NICE BIG WINDOW THAT LOOKS OUT OVER TO THE BACKYARD.
157,ep150,"(Mom) DON'T FORGET, IT LOOKS BIGGER BECAUSE THERE ARE NO WALLS UP."
158,ep150,"YOU ALSO HAVE NO FURNITURE IN HERE, EITHER."
159,ep150,"YOU ALSO HAVE NO FURNITURE IN HERE, EITHER."
160,ep150,"YEAH. SO FAR, THIS IS THE BEST HOME THEY'VE SEEN, BUT IT'S STILL LACKING MANY OPTIONS, LIKE A THIRD BEDROOM, WHICH JAY AND DANIELLE ORIGINALLY WANTED IN A HOME."
161,ep150,"(Terry) WELL, WHAT DID YOU THINK?"
162,ep150,(Danielle) I DON'T KNOW.
163,ep150,(Jay) I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP LOOKING.
164,ep150,"(Suzanne) WHEN WE RETURN, JAY AND DANIELLE'S SEARCH FOR THEIR DREAM HOME TAKES A SURPRISING TWIST BECAUSE OF JAY'S PARENTS, WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS CONTINUES."
165,ep150,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
166,ep150,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
167,ep150,NEWLYWEDS JAY AND DANIELLE WILLIAMS HAVE JUST BEGUN THEIR SEARCH FOR A HOUSE.
168,ep150,"THIS MOTIVATED AND ORGANIZED COUPLE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, BUT WITH HOME PRICES IN THE AREA SO HIGH, THEY'RE BEGINNING TO THINK THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE SOME SERIOUS COMPROMISES."
169,ep150,JAY'S PARENTS ARE IN TOWN FOR A VISIT AND ARE SURPRISED AT HOW LITTLE THE COUPLE'S DOWN PAYMENT WILL BUY THEM.
170,ep150,THE WHOLE GROUP IS A LITTLE DISHEARTENED AT JAY AND DANIELLE'S PROSPECTS.
171,ep150,(Mom) I DON'T KNOW...
172,ep150,"TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THE PRICE, HOW MUCH MONEY YOU COULD AFFORD."
173,ep150,"WELL, WE JUST SORT OF CALCULATED ALL OF OUR FINANCES AND TALKED TO TERRY AND PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE WORKSHEET ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE GOT EACH MONTH, AND HOW MUCH MONEY WE COULD SPEND EACH MONTH, AND THEN HOW MUCH MONEY A LENDER WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE US."
174,ep150,"AND THEN DETERMINED HOW MUCH MONEY WE COULD GIVE IN A DOWN PAYMENT, AND THAT CAME OUT TO THE TYPE OF HOUSE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT."
175,ep150,"WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF YOUR MOTHER AND I-- YOU KNOW, WE CHATTED ABOUT IT A BIT-- IF WE HELPED YOU WITH THE DOWN PAYMENT?"
176,ep150,WOULD THAT BE HELPFUL?
177,ep150,THAT WOULD BE GREAT!
178,ep150,"I MEAN, WE WOULD LOVE THAT, BECAUSE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A MUCH NICER HOME."
179,ep150,"I MEAN, WE'D BE ABLE TO GO INTO A BETTER RANGE OF HOUSES WHERE THERE'S MORE POSSIBILITIES."
180,ep150,WHERE THERE'S MORE POSSIBILITIES.
181,ep150,"THAT WOULD BE REALLY, REALLY GREAT!"
182,ep150,"THAT WOULD BE REALLY, REALLY GREAT!"
183,ep150,IT WOULD BE GREAT.
184,ep150,"I KNOW YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK TO GET THIS FAR, AND I REALLY FEEL BADLY ABOUT TELLING YOU TO SCRUB IT ALL AND JUST GO OUT AND DO IT AGAIN."
185,ep150,THAT'S FINE!
186,ep150,THAT'S FINE!

7,ep151,IT'S ALL NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep151,"♪♪ (Cynde) BRAD, LOOK AT THESE CONDOS THAT CAESAR SENT OVER."
9,ep151,SOME OF THEM HAVE PICTURES.
10,ep151,"OH, GREAT!"
11,ep151,"LIKE, LOOK AT THIS ONE."
12,ep151,THAT ONE LOOKS PRETTY NICE.
13,ep151,(Suzanne) BRAD AND CYNDE CARLEY ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW PLACE TO LIVE.
14,ep151,"AS CONSULTANTS FOR A COMPUTER FIRM, THIS BUSY COUPLE HAS BEEN SPLITTING THEIR TIME BETWEEN THE EAST AND WEST COASTS FOR OVER A YEAR."
15,ep151,"WHAT WE USUALLY DO IS WE'LL FLY OUT TO THE EAST COAST TOGETHER ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON, AND THEN WE'LL WORK FOR TWO WEEKS THERE."
16,ep151,"AND THEN I'LL FLY BACK ON A MONDAY MORNING, AND THEN I'LL WORK THAT WEEK, AND THEN I'LL PICK HIM UP THAT FRIDAY AT THE AIRPORT."
17,ep151,"AND THEN WE'LL SPEND A WEEKEND, A WEEK AND ANOTHER WEEKEND TOGETHER AND DO IT AGAIN."
18,ep151,"(Suzanne) EXHAUSTED FROM THIS HECTIC SCHEDULE, THE CARLEYS ARE HOPING TO SETTLE DOWN ON THE WEST COAST AND STABILIZE THEIR LIVES."
19,ep151,"SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE NEVER HAVE A WEEKEND JUST TO SIT AND READ THE PAPER, AND PART..."
20,ep151,"AND THAT'S BY CHOICE, A LOT OF IT..."
21,ep151,RIGHT? PART OF THIS WHOLE HOME BUYING IS THAT WE NEED TO LIKE SETTLE DOWN...
22,ep151,"YEAH. SOME STABILITY IN OUR LIVES, JUST RELAX."
23,ep151,WE THINK...
24,ep151,"SINCE WE CAN'T DO IT ON OUR OWN, WE THINK THAT MAYBE BUYING A HOME WILL FORCE US INTO SOME SORT OF STABILITY."
25,ep151,"(Suzanne) AFTER TWO YEARS IN THEIR RENTED APARTMENT, THE CARLEYS ARE LOOKING FOR A CHANGE."
26,ep151,"OH, HOME SWEET HOME."
27,ep151,LOOKS THE SAME.
28,ep151,"YEAH. WHAT WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN IS GETTING A CONDO, SO WE CAN HAVE SOME SORT OF INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE NOT JUST KIND OF THROWING AWAY OUR MONEY ON RENT."
29,ep151,SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A CONDO THAT WOULD OFFER KIND OF THE CONVENIENCES OF LIFE.
30,ep151,"OH, THIS IS HEAVY!"
31,ep151,IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.
32,ep151,"ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GET THE REST OF THE STUFF..."
33,ep151,OKAY? GONNA START A LOAD OF LAUNDRY.
34,ep151,OKAY. ANOTHER THING THE CARLEYS DISLIKE ABOUT RENTING IS THE SHARED LAUNDRY ROOM.
35,ep151,"(Cynde) IT'S FAIRLY CONVENIENT, BUT STILL IT'S EXPENSIVE."
36,ep151,"AND WHEN WE'RE DOING LIKE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES AND STUFF, YOU END UP WITH A LOT OF LAUNDRY."
37,ep151,"AND ALSO, I MEAN, IT COSTS $1.75"
38,ep151,EVERY LOAD THAT WE DO.
39,ep151,"OH, THE QUARTERS!"
40,ep151,"BASICALLY, WE'RE LOOKING FOR LIKE THREE MAIN THINGS IN A CONDO AND THAT'S INSIDE LAUNDRY, A GARAGE OR PRIVATE PARKING SPOT FOR AT LEAST ONE CAR, AND OUTSIDE ENTRANCE."
41,ep151,"(Suzanne) BRAD AND CYNDE ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR A CONDO WITH A GOOD LAYOUT FOR ENTERTAINING, AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR THIS OUTGOING COUPLE."
42,ep151,"(Brad) IT'S JUST SO MUCH FUN TO ENTERTAIN, AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO US IN A PLACE, IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE A NICE KITCHEN TO DO THE COOKING AND A LIVING ROOM TO DO ENTERTAINMENT."
43,ep151,(Suzanne) BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.
44,ep151,"ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US IS, BECAUSE WE LIKE TO BE OUTSIDE, WE'D LIKE TO FIND A CONDO WITH A BALCONY, SOME KIND OF OUTSIDE ENTRANCE THAT WE CAN..."
45,ep151,OR PATIO.
46,ep151,OR A PATIO...
47,ep151,SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY INTEGRATE BEING OUTSIDE AS PART OF OUR LIVING SPACE.
48,ep151,RIGHT. THEIR LOVE OF BEING OUTDOORS LEADS BRAD AND CYNDE TO DECIDE THAT THEY ALSO REALLY WANT TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT BEACH AREA.
49,ep151,"BUT MOST OF ALL, BRAD AND CYNDE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CHANGING THEIR LIVES."
50,ep151,"(Brad) I THINK HAVING THIS NEW HOUSE IS GOING TO REALLY GIVE US A STRUCTURE TO OUR LIFE, AND IT'S KIND OF A PUN, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL PUT OUR ENERGY INTO."
51,ep151,I THINK IT'S REALLY GONNA CHANGE A LOT ABOUT US AND OUR HECTIC SCHEDULE.
52,ep151,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, WE'LL GO INTO THE CONDO MARKET WITH BRAD AND CYNDE..."
53,ep151,"WOW, SHOEBOX."
54,ep151,... SEE JUST HOW MUCH BEACHFRONT PROPERTY THEIR BUDGET WILL BUY.
55,ep151,WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
56,ep151,CYNDE AND BRAD CARLEY ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO CALL HOME.
57,ep151,"AFTER SPENDING THE PAST YEAR TRAVELING FROM COAST TO COAST, THE CARLEYS WANT MORE STABILITY IN THEIR LIVES."
58,ep151,THEY'RE HOPING THAT BUYING A HOME OF THEIR OWN WILL HELP THEM ATTAIN THAT GOAL.
59,ep151,THEY'VE DECIDED THAT A COMFORTABLE CONDOMINIUM IS THEIR BEST BET TO OFFER THEM THE STABILITY THEY WANT WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT BEACH NEIGHBORHOOD.
60,ep151,"TO HELP THEM IN THEIR QUEST, BRAD AND CYNDE HAVE ENLISTED THE HELP OF REAL ESTATE AGENT CESAR MARQUEZ."
61,ep151,(Cesar) BRAD AND CYNDE ARE GREAT.
62,ep151,MY GOAL IS TO GET THEM THE BEST DEAL FOR THEIR MONEY.
63,ep151,I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND THE PROPERTY OF THEIR DREAMS.
64,ep151,"OKAY, SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A TWO-BEDROOM, TWO-BATH UNIT."
65,ep151,"OKAY. TODAY, THE GROUP WILL TOUR TWO CONDOS BEFORE CYNDE AND BRAD HEAD TO THE AIRPORT TO BEGIN, YET, ANOTHER BUSINESS TRIP."
66,ep151,HOW MANY LEVELS IS THIS?
67,ep151,THIS IS THREE LEVELS.
68,ep151,"YOU HAVE THE LIVING ROOM AREA, FIREPLACE..."
69,ep151,IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE A FIREPLACE.
70,ep151,"YEAH, IT WOULD."
71,ep151,THE WET BAR...
72,ep151,AND THE KITCHEN.
73,ep151,"SO WE HAVE BUILT-INS, TILE COUNTERTOPS, AND THE REFRIGERATOR'S INCLUDED."
74,ep151,LET'S TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE.
75,ep151,IT WOULDN'T BE THAT GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING.
76,ep151,NO. PATIO.
77,ep151,"YEAH, IT'S NICE TO HAVE A PRIVATE PATIO."
78,ep151,"IT'S A SOUTH- FACING UNIT, CLOSE TO THE BEACH."
79,ep151,"WE COULD PLANT SOME TREES OUT HERE, MAYBE."
80,ep151,AT LEAST WE'RE OUTSIDE...
81,ep151,RIGHT? SOME PLANTERS...
82,ep151,YEAH. WAS NICE.
83,ep151,GO AHEAD.
84,ep151,THANK YOU.
85,ep151,(Suzanne) CESAR TAKES THEM UPSTAIRS TO THE SECOND FLOOR.
86,ep151,(Cynde) VERY BIG.
87,ep151,THIS IS THE MASTER SUITE.
88,ep151,YOU HAVE A LOFT UPSTAIRS.
89,ep151,"WE COULD PUT THE OFFICE UP THERE, I GUESS, THE COMPUTERS AND STUFF."
90,ep151,"YEAH, THAT'D BE A GOOD SPACE FOR THE OFFICE."
91,ep151,"SO TAKE A MINUTE AND JUST GET A FEEL FOR THE AREA, AND PICTURE YOURSELF LIVING IN THIS SPACE."
92,ep151,OKAY. DON'T KNOW...
93,ep151,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
94,ep151,IT'S KIND OF APARTMENTY LIVING STILL.
95,ep151,"YEAH. MEAN, IT'S NICE, BUT I JUST GET THAT..."
96,ep151,"YEAH, IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK, I DON'T THINK."
97,ep151,I KIND OF GET THAT APARTMENT- LIVING FEELING.
98,ep151,"(Brad) YEAH, I THINK THAT WAS A LITTLE PRICEY FOR THE SPACE."
99,ep151,DON'T YOU THINK?
100,ep151,YEAH. READY TO SEE THE NEXT ONE.
101,ep151,"OKAY. AS CYNDE AND BRAD HEAD TO THE NEXT CONDO, THEY'RE HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL BE LESS LIKE AN APARTMENT AND MORE LIKE A HOME THAN THE LAST ONE."
102,ep151,"(Cynde) YEAH, I LIKE IT."
103,ep151,"(Brad) YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
104,ep151,"IT'S NOT ONE ON THE TOP FLOOR, IS IT?"
105,ep151,"NO, THIS ONE'S ON THE FIRST FLOOR, BUT THEY'RE TWO-STORY."
106,ep151,IT'S A TOWNHOUSE.
107,ep151,IT'S A TOWNHOUSE?
108,ep151,YEAH. OKAY.
109,ep151,"OKAY, SO HERE WE HAVE A TWO-BEDROOM, TWO-AND-A-HALF BATH."
110,ep151,ALL RIGHT...
111,ep151,"WHOOPS, EXCUSE ME."
112,ep151,"WE HAVE A HALF BATH TO OUR RIGHT, AND WE HAVE A KITCHEN HERE."
113,ep151,"OH, THAT'S PRETTY SMALL."
114,ep151,KIND OF SMALL.
115,ep151,IT'S WEIRD HOW THEY DO THE REFRIGERATOR LIKE THAT.
116,ep151,FIREPLACE... DINING AREA...
117,ep151,LIVING ROOM...
118,ep151,THIS IS PRETTY SMALL.
119,ep151,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
120,ep151,IT'S ALL RIGHT.
121,ep151,AND OVER HERE WE HAVE THE FIREPLACE.
122,ep151,IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GAS...
123,ep151,HUH? VIEWS.
124,ep151,OKAY. TAKE A LOOK UPSTAIRS.
125,ep151,(Suzanne) FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE CRITICAL.
126,ep151,THE CARLEYS' FIRST IMPRESSION OF THIS CONDO IS THAT IT'S JUST TOO SMALL.
127,ep151,SO UPSTAIRS WE HAVE TWO BEDROOMS.
128,ep151,THE FIRST BEDROOM...
129,ep151,WALL-TO-WALL CLOSETS.
130,ep151,"WOW, SHOEBOX."
131,ep151,(Suzanne) CYNDE AND BRAD ARE GETTING FRUSTRATED THAT THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIND ANYTHING BIGGER FOR THE MONEY THEY'RE SPENDING.
132,ep151,THEY'RE SMALL...
133,ep151,THEY'RE TOO SMALL.
134,ep151,"YEAH. MEAN, WE MIGHT AS WELL STAY IN AN APARTMENT..."
135,ep151,RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA DO THAT.
136,ep151,"I MEAN, CAN YOU FIND SOMETHING BIGGER HERE?"
137,ep151,"WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL CONDOS NOW, AND BEING WHERE WE'RE LOOKING, YOU'RE PAYING A PREMIUM TO BE NEAR THE OCEAN."
138,ep151,"RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT."
139,ep151,"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH MORE SPACE, MORE UPGRADES, THEN MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS EXPAND YOUR CRITERIA, MOVE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER EAST."
140,ep151,YOU'LL STILL BE WITHIN THE DISTANCE TO ROLLERBLADE AND BIKE TO THE BEACH.
141,ep151,RIGHT. GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY.
142,ep151,YOU'LL GET POSSIBLY EVEN A HOUSE.
143,ep151,"(Suzanne) FOR CYNDE AND BRAD, WHO BELIEVED THEY COULD NOT AFFORD A HOME IN A NEIGHBORHOOD ANYWHERE NEAR THE BEACH, CESAR HAS SAID THE MAGIC WORD."
144,ep151,LET'S DO IT.
145,ep151,ALL RIGHT.
146,ep151,(Suzanne) CESAR QUICKLY CHECKS HIS LISTINGS TO FIND SOME HOMES IN THEIR PRICE RANGE THAT ARE A LITTLE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE BEACH.
147,ep151,"OH, YEAH."
148,ep151,"OKAY, SO THIS IS A FOUR-BEDROOM, TWO-BATH HERE."
149,ep151,"WE HAVE HARDWOOD FLOORS, REMODELED KITCHEN."
150,ep151,"THE LOTS HERE, SINCE WE'RE STILL FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE BEACH, ARE GONNA BE GENERALLY SMALLER."
151,ep151,"IF WE HEADED EAST, WE COULD PROBABLY GET A LARGER LOT."
152,ep151,SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
153,ep151,OKAY. IS NICE.
154,ep151,"SO WE HAVE TILED COUNTERTOPS, BUILT-IN APPLIANCES, BREAKFAST AREA."
155,ep151,NICE. IS DEFINITELY MORE THE...
156,ep151,YEAH. THE SIZE THAT WE WANT.
157,ep151,LOTS OF CUPBOARD SPACE.
158,ep151,IT'S NICE FOR ENTERTAINING.
159,ep151,IT'S GREAT...
160,ep151,LET'S MOVE ON.
161,ep151,OH! IS NICE.
162,ep151,THIS IS NICE...
163,ep151,THE CABINET'S NICE.
164,ep151,"YEAH, THE TILE'S REALLY NICE, TOO."
165,ep151,"(Suzanne) ALREADY, THE CARLEYS CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK."
166,ep151,"STILL FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE BEACH, THE HOMES IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ARE MUCH LARGER THAN THE CONDOS THE COUPLE HAD STARTED LOOKING AT, AND THERE'S ANOTHER BIG BONUS TO HAVING A HOUSE."
167,ep151,"OH, YEAH!"
168,ep151,"OH, A BACKYARD!"
169,ep151,THIS IS CUTE.
170,ep151,YES. GOT ANY FRUIT TREES HERE?
171,ep151,NO FRUIT TREES.
172,ep151,VERY NICE.
173,ep151,"SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PROPERTY, THE HOUSE, THE LOT SIZE?"
174,ep151,I LIKE THE HOUSE...
175,ep151,THE HOUSE IS FINE...
176,ep151,I THINK MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BACKYARD AND A GARAGE.
177,ep151,"YEAH, THAT WOULD BE NICE."
178,ep151,"A LITTLE BIT BIGGER BACKYARD, MAYBE."
179,ep151,LIKE MORE OF A LAWN.
180,ep151,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT CYNDE AND BRAD HAVE GONE FROM LOOKING AT CONDOS TO LOOKING AT HOUSES, IT'S A LITTLE LIKE STARTING OVER, AND THE COUPLE IS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW CLOSE THEY CAN GET TO THEIR IDEAL HOUSE."
181,ep151,ALL RIGHT.
182,ep151,OKAY. CESAR.
183,ep151,YEAH. IS DEFINITELY THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
184,ep151,CANCEL THOSE OTHER CONDOS THAT WE WERE GONNA LOOK AT.
185,ep151,"OKAY. MEAN, LET'S JUST LOOK AT HOMES."
186,ep151,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT THE CARLEYS HAVE DECIDED TO CHANGE THEIR SCOPE ENTIRELY, THEY HAVE A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON BUYING A HOME."
187,ep151,BUT WILL THEY BE HAPPY WITH THEIR DECISION TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD?
188,ep151,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
189,ep151,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
190,ep151,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
191,ep151,FIRST-TIME BUYERS BRAD AND CYNDE CARLEY HAVE DECIDED TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF THEIR SEARCH FOR A NEW PLACE TO LIVE.
192,ep151,INITIALLY THEY WANTED TO BUY A CONDO IN THEIR PRESENT NEIGHBORHOOD BY THE BEACH.
193,ep151,BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT WAS BIG ENOUGH IN THEIR PRICE RANGE.
194,ep151,"WITH THE HELP OF THEIR REALTOR, CESAR MARQUEZ, BRAD AND CYNDE DECIDED TO LOOK FURTHER AWAY FROM THE BEACH WHERE THEY COULD AFFORD A HOME RATHER THAN A CONDOMINIUM."
195,ep151,"OKAY, SO THIS ONE'S A THREE-BEDROOM, TWO-BATH."
196,ep151,"YOU KNOW, CESAR, I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK, TOO, SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS QUICK."
197,ep151,OKAY. THIS MUST BE THE DINING ROOM.
198,ep151,"WE'RE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE BEACH, BUT FOR THE SQUARE FOOTAGE IN LOT SIZE, WE'RE GONNA GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY OUT OF HERE."
199,ep151,OKAY. TAKE A LOOK.
200,ep151,HERE WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEDROOMS.
201,ep151,"OH, NICE OFFICE."
202,ep151,REALLY. CABINETS.
203,ep151,"(Suzanne) SHORT ON TIME, CYNDE AND BRAD QUICKLY TOUR THE HOUSE."
204,ep151,WE HAVE A BATHROOM.
205,ep151,"OH, THIS IS NICE."
206,ep151,I LIKE THE CERAMIC TILE.
207,ep151,"OH, YEAH."
208,ep151,AND THE GLASS BLOCK REALLY LETS IN A LOT OF LIGHT.
209,ep151,OVER HERE WE HAVE THE KITCHEN WITH BUILT-INS...
210,ep151,"OH, NICE."
211,ep151,I LIKE THE KITCHEN.
212,ep151,"LEADING OUT TO THE LIVING ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE, PATIO OUT THE BACK."
213,ep151,"THIS WOULD BE GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING, WOULDN'T IT?"
214,ep151,YEAH... IS WONDERFUL.
215,ep151,WE HAVE THE MASTER SUITE UPSTAIRS.
216,ep151,LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
217,ep151,OKAY. HERE WE HAVE THE MASTER SUITE...
218,ep151,"OH, THIS IS NICE."
219,ep151,"MASTER BATHROOM, WALL-TO-WALL CLOSETS, AND A BALCONY OFF THE MASTER SUITE."
220,ep151,THIS IS GREAT.
221,ep151,YEAH. GO OUT HERE.
222,ep151,LET'S CHECK THIS OUT.
223,ep151,"OH, WOW..."
224,ep151,LOOK AT THIS VIEW OF THE GOLF COURSE.
225,ep151,"OH, THIS IS SO NICE."
226,ep151,WOW! IS GREAT.
227,ep151,THIS IS COOL.
228,ep151,"LOOK AT THE HIGH CEILINGS, TOO."
229,ep151,OKAY? HERE WE HAVE A LAUNDRY ROOM.
230,ep151,"OH, THAT'S NICE."
231,ep151,"OH, WOW!"
232,ep151,"YOU MEAN, WE'D HAVE OUR OWN WASHER AND DRYER?"
233,ep151,YEAH! BE AWESOME.
234,ep151,LET ME SHOW YOU THE YARD.
235,ep151,OKAY. GOT A JACUZZI BACK HERE...
236,ep151,"OH, WOW!"
237,ep151,SOME FRUIT TREES.
238,ep151,"OH, THIS IS GREAT."
239,ep151,"HEY, BRAD!"
240,ep151,HEY... TREE!
241,ep151,"OH, A PLUM TREE."
242,ep151,IT'S SO PRIVATE BACK HERE.
243,ep151,"WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US A MINUTE, LET US KIND OF GET BACK TO YOU ON THIS?"
244,ep151,OKAY... MEET YOU OUT FRONT.
245,ep151,OKAY. CESAR.
246,ep151,"SO? LOVE IT, BRAD."
247,ep151,I KNOW.
248,ep151,IT FEELS SO PRIVATE.
249,ep151,I KNOW.
250,ep151,ISN'T THIS AMAZING?
251,ep151,"(Suzanne) THEY'VE ONLY BEEN IN THE HOUSE FOR TEN MINUTES, BUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT JUST FEELS RIGHT."
252,ep151,"CYNDE HAS GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK, BUT THE COUPLE SITS DOWN TO QUICKLY DISCUSS HOW THEY FEEL."
253,ep151,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
254,ep151,"BRAD, I LOVE IT."
255,ep151,REALLY? JUST HAS EVERYTHING THAT I'M LOOKING FOR.
256,ep151,IT'S THE BEST PLACE WE'VE SEEN SO FAR.
257,ep151,IT HAS A FORMAL DINING ROOM WHERE WE CAN PUT OUR DINING ROOM FURNITURE.
258,ep151,IT HAS A GUEST BEDROOM.
259,ep151,IT HAS AN OFFICE WHERE WE CAN PUT OUR COMPUTER AND EVERYTHING IN.
260,ep151,IT HAS A LAUNDRY ROOM.
261,ep151,IT JUST HAS EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
262,ep151,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
263,ep151,I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE AN OFFER.
264,ep151,I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT.
265,ep151,ALL RIGHT.
266,ep151,LET'S DO IT!
267,ep151,ALL RIGHT.
268,ep151,"(Suzanne) MAKING DECISIONS QUICKLY IS WHAT BRAD AND CYNDE DO BEST, AND THEY BOTH AGREE THAT THIS IS ONE HOUSE THEY SHOULD NOT LET GET AWAY."
269,ep151,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
270,ep151,I LOVE IT.
271,ep151,THAT'S GREAT!
272,ep151,WE'D LIKE TO PUT IN AN OFFER.
273,ep151,OKAY. BUT I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.
274,ep151,OKAY. I CAN COME TO YOUR OFFICE?
275,ep151,"YEAH, WE CAN GO TO MY OFFICE."
276,ep151,OKAY. I KNEW YOU'D LOVE THIS HOUSE.
277,ep151,"WITHIN DAYS, CYNDE AND BRAD HAVE STRUCK A DEAL TO BUY THE HOUSE."
278,ep151,"BUT FOR THE CARLEYS, GETTING AN ACCEPTED OFFER WAS THE EASY PART."
279,ep151,"NOW THAT THE HOUSE IS IN ESCROW, THEY'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT MAKING THE DECISION SO QUICKLY."
280,ep151,WHAT IF THE HOUSE HAS PROBLEMS THEY DIDN'T SEE?
281,ep151,"TO SETTLE THIS ISSUE, THE CARLEYS HIRE A HOME INSPECTOR TO THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE HOUSE."
282,ep151,"UNFORTUNATELY, THE CARLEYS' HECTIC WORK SCHEDULE MEANS THEY WON'T EVEN BE IN TOWN WHEN THE INSPECTION TAKES PLACE."
283,ep151,"THE CARLEYS WILL BE ON THE PHONE LONG-DISTANCE WITH CYNDE'S SISTER KIM AND THEIR FRIEND GARY, A CONTRACTOR, DURING THE INSPECTION."
284,ep151,"(inspector) HOWDY, GUYS."
285,ep151,HOW YOU DOING?
286,ep151,HI... CRAIG.
287,ep151,I'M GARY.
288,ep151,"GARY, IT'S A PLEASURE."
289,ep151,"HI... KIM, CYNDE'S SISTER."
290,ep151,"KIM, IT'S A PLEASURE."
291,ep151,SO THIS IS THE PLACE?
292,ep151,YEP. WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO START?
293,ep151,"(Suzanne) MEANWHILE, CYNDE AND BRAD ARE IN AN EAST COAST HOTEL ROOM, LISTENING IN AS THE INSPECTION BEGINS IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM."
294,ep151,(Kim) ...
295,ep151,GARY ARE CHECKING IT OUT.
296,ep151,"OH, YOU GOT A SINK, AND YOU GOT SOME SHELVES."
297,ep151,"YEAH, CYN, IT LOOKS REAL CLEAN."
298,ep151,WHAT YOU GOT BACK THERE?
299,ep151,"WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE DON'T HAVE A GAS SHUT-OFF VALVE ON THE DRYER."
300,ep151,YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT BACK THERE.
301,ep151,RIGHT. CERTAINLY SOMETHING YOU WANNA TAKE CARE OF.
302,ep151,THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.
303,ep151,"IF YOU CAN GET THAT TAKEN CARE OF, EVERYTHING ELSE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD OUT HERE."
304,ep151,"I CHECKED THIS OUT EARLIER, SO THAT'S IT."
305,ep151,(Suzanne) THEN THE TEAM CHECKS THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE CRAIG AND GARY FIND A LEAK.
306,ep151,"YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE WATER HAS COME DOWN HERE, AND WHERE THEY JOINED IT, THEY SEALED IT WITH A..."
307,ep151,FIBERGLASS TAPE.
308,ep151,"EXACTLY. THAT'S COME LOOSE, SO WE MAY BE GETTING SOME WATER ON THE INSIDE."
309,ep151,"WHEN WE GO INSIDE, WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE DOUBLE-CHECK IN HERE."
310,ep151,"WE'RE ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, AND THERE'S A LITTLE WATER DAMAGE."
311,ep151,IT HAS TO DO WITH A ROOF ON THE REMODEL.
312,ep151,WE'RE GONNA GO INSIDE AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME INSIDE DAMAGE.
313,ep151,LEAK OUTSIDE...
314,ep151,"SO THIS IS WHERE IF WE HAVE A LEAK, WE'D PROBABLY MOST LIKELY SEE IT."
315,ep151,BRAD... WE ARE.
316,ep151,WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LEAK THAT WE HAD OUTSIDE.
317,ep151,"WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF IT TRAVELED INSIDE ANYWHERE, AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS."
318,ep151,NOW DON'T GET HIM PANICKED HERE.
319,ep151,WE DON'T KNOW...
320,ep151,DON'T PANIC.
321,ep151,WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S LEAKING NOW.
322,ep151,"WE JUST KNOW THAT IT HAS LEAKED, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WANNA TAKE A LOOK AT AND MAKE SURE IT'S NOT PRESENTLY LEAKING."
323,ep151,THEY PUT ALL THAT TAR OUT THERE.
324,ep151,"TAR, WE CONSIDER A TEMPORARY PATCH."
325,ep151,RIGHT. THE INSPECTION WRAPS UP IN THE BATHROOM WHERE CRAIG FINDS ANOTHER POTENTIAL PROBLEM.
326,ep151,"WHOA, SEE THAT?"
327,ep151,"(Gary) OH, YEAH."
328,ep151,"WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU FLUSH THAT TOILET, IT'S GOING TO POSSIBLY LEAK UNDERNEATH THERE."
329,ep151,THERE'S A WAX RING THAT SEALS BETWEEN THE SEWER LINE AND THE FLOOR.
330,ep151,"AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME YOU FLUSH IT, IF THAT WAX RING IS NOT SITTING IN THERE PROPERLY, WHICH IT'S NOT SECURED, WE COULD GET SOME WATER GOING ONTO THE SUBFLOOR AND ONTO THE CERAMIC TILE, WHICH COULD CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE DOWN THERE."

275,ep152,LIGHT. IT CERTAINLY NEEDS
276,ep152,"LIGHT. YOU COULD PAINT IT, YOU COULD PAINT IT, OR YOU COULD PUT A DIFFERENT KIND OF SKYLIGHT IN IT, IF YOU WANTED A LITTLE MORE"
277,ep152,LIGHT. IT'S NICE

280,ep152,"NICE. (Suzanne) ONE OF NANCY'S OTHER REQUIREMENTS IS THAT THE HOME HAVE A GOOD KITCHEN FOR COOKING, AND THIS ONE HAS DEFINITE"
281,ep152,"POTENTIAL. (Leigh) THE KITCHEN, TO ME, IS LIKE THE ORIGINAL KITCHENS--IT'S SPREAD OUT A LITTLE BIT-- BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SURFACES IN DIFFERENT AREAS TO WORK WITH, SO IT LENDS ITSELF TO A LITTLE"

301,ep152,THIS. (Suzanne) SEEING THE BUILT-IN HOME OFFICE GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS SELLING NANCY ON THIS
302,ep152,"HOUSE. SO FAR, IT'S GOT EVERY ITEM ON HER"
303,ep152,LIST. (Leigh)
304,ep152,"OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO IN AND LOOK AT THE REST OF"
305,ep152,IT. OKAY. IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT HERE

326,ep152,BIGGER. MAKES THE ROOM SEEM A LITTLE BIT
327,ep152,BIGGER. OKAY. THE ONLY DRAWBACK SO FAR IS THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE OF THE HOME'S

5,ep153,THE CHALLENGE IS FINDING A HOME THAT SUITS THREE VERY DISTINCTIVE TASTES.
6,ep153,CAN THESE THREE GENERATIONS FIND ONE HOUSE THAT'S A PERFECT FIT FOR EACH OF THEM?
7,ep153,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.

17,ep153,"FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS THE COMMUTE WAS FINE, BUT IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS, THE AREA'S GROWN A LOT, AND THE COMMUTE HAS GOTTEN RATHER HECTIC."

20,ep153,"TO ME, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE, TO HAVE A HOME THAT I REALLY CAN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN."
21,ep153,"(Suzanne) THIS FAMILY ACTUALLY LIKES THEIR CURRENT HOME, AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE COMMUTE, THEY'D STAY."
22,ep153,"(Lois) WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE KITCHEN IS THAT IT'S COMPACT, BUT IT'S NOT SO SMALL THAT YOU DON'T HAVE MOVING ROOM."
23,ep153,"IF YOU'RE AT THE STOVE, YOU CAN JUST TURN, AND NOW YOU'RE RIGHT AT THE SINK."
24,ep153,"(Suzanne) THE KITCHEN IS BERTHA'S DOMAIN, SINCE SHE COOKS MOST OF THE FAMILY'S MEALS."
25,ep153,"AND SHE, TOO, LIKES THE WAY THE ROOM IS LAID OUT."
26,ep153,ELISHA HAS HER OWN FAVORITE PARTS OF THIS HOUSE.
27,ep153,I LIKE THE VAULTED CEILINGS IN THE HOUSE.
28,ep153,THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT MY EYE WHEN WE CAME HERE.
29,ep153,"I LIKE THE WAY THAT THE WINDOWS ARE SET UP, THE LITTLE DECORATIVE PARTS ACROSS THE WINDOWS."
30,ep153,"I LIKE THE WAY THE STAIRCASE IS SET UP, AND YOU CAN LOOK DOWN OVER INTO THE LIVING ROOM."
31,ep153,"IT KIND OF GIVES YOU THAT, YOU KNOW, DAME-WITH-A-MANOR TYPE FEELING."
32,ep153,"YOU KNOW, YOU CAN LOOK DOWN ON EVERYBODY, AND I LIKE THAT."
33,ep153,(Suzanne) BUT ELISHA'S MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DISAGREE-- THEY'D RATHER NOT HAVE TO CLIMB STAIRS-- AND ALL THREE LADIES WOULD LIKE BIGGER BEDROOMS.
34,ep153,"ELISHA, IN PARTICULAR, WANTS A ROOM THAT'S SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE HOUSE FOR ADDED PRIVACY."
35,ep153,(Elisha) I HAVE THE MASTER.
36,ep153,I JUST LIKE THE WAY THAT IT'S SET UP.
37,ep153,IT HAS THE SEPARATE TOILET FACILITIES.
38,ep153,THERE'S A DOUBLE SINK.
39,ep153,I LIKE IT...
40,ep153,IT'S A LOT OF SPACE.
41,ep153,I TOOK THE SECOND LARGEST BEDROOM WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE.

43,ep153,"BUT I'M HOPING WHEN WE MOVE, I'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE SPACE, SO THAT I CAN KIND OF ARRANGE MY STUFF, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALL OF MY THINGS ARE JUST KIND OF CRAMPED."

54,ep153,"IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, BECAUSE THEY ARE TRACT HOMES, THEY'RE BUILT CLOSE TOGETHER."
55,ep153,IT'S ALMOST LIKE OUR FRONT DOORS ARE RIGHT UP ON EACH OTHER.
56,ep153,OUR NEIGHBOR'S FRONT DOOR'S RIGHT NEAR OUR BEDROOM WINDOWS.

72,ep153,THIS IS THE FIRST ONE WE LOOKED AT.
73,ep153,"(Suzanne) BUT AS THEY LOOK AT HOMES ON THE MARKET, THEY BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT IT WON'T BE EASY FINDING THE PERFECT HOUSE."
74,ep153,(Elisha) I THINK THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE PROBABLY WOULD BE FINDING SOMETHING THAT MAKES EVERYBODY HAPPY.
75,ep153,"YOU KNOW, WHERE EVERYONE CAN WALK IN AND GO, OKAY, I CAN DEAL WITH THIS."
76,ep153,"OKAY, I CAN DEAL WITH THIS."
77,ep153,YEAH. CAN SEE MYSELF HERE FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS.
78,ep153,I THINK THAT'LL BE THE HARDEST PART.
79,ep153,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, WE'LL GO BACK INTO THE CITY WITH THIS FAMILY AS THEY FIND OUT JUST HOW HARD IT IS TO PLEASE ALL THREE OF THEM."

84,ep153,HELPING THEM FIND THIS ONE PERFECT HOME IS VETERAN REALTOR JEANETTE WILLIAMS.
85,ep153,"(Jeanette) IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE TRYING TO MEET THE PARTICULARS FOR ALL THREE OF THESE LADIES, BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE DIFFERENT GENERATIONS, WHO ARE GONNA BE LIVING IN ONE HOUSEHOLD UNDER ONE ROOF, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THEM A HOME THAT I KNOW ALL THREE OF THEM WILL BE VERY COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY WITH."
86,ep153,AND I CAN DO IT!
87,ep153,"(Suzanne) AND AFTER SEEING MORE THAN A DOZEN HOUSES ALREADY, THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE THIS GROUP WILL NEED, IF THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO FIND AN IDEAL HOUSE."
88,ep153,"THIS IS A FOUR- BEDROOM, TWO-BATH."
89,ep153,"AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBORHOOD."
90,ep153,"(Lois) OH, I SEE THE GARAGE IS NOT ENCLOSED."
91,ep153,"NO, IT ISN'T."
92,ep153,"OH, WE'VE GOT NEW CARPET, AND IT'S BEEN PAINTED INSIDE."

104,ep153,OKAY. HAVE TO HAVE...
105,ep153,"OKAY. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR ELISHA TO DEVELOP AN OPINION ABOUT THIS HOUSE, SO SHE WAITS OUTSIDE WHILE HER MOTHER LOIS AND GRANDMOTHER BERTHA FINISH LOOKING AROUND."
106,ep153,THIS IS ANOTHER BEDROOM HERE.
107,ep153,"OH, OKAY, BUT IT'S A SMALL BEDROOM."
108,ep153,THIS ONE IS EVEN SMALLER THAN THE ONE I HAVE NOW.
109,ep153,(Suzanne) SMALL BEDROOMS AND A KITCHEN WITHOUT A DISHWASHER SOON LEAD LOIS AND BERTHA TO THE SAME CONCLUSION ELISHA HAS REACHED-- THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE FOR THEM.
110,ep153,"(Jeanette) OKAY, WE'LL GO ON NOW TO THE NEXT ONE."
111,ep153,"(Suzanne) THESE THREE LADIES ALL HAVE STRONG OPINIONS, AND THEY'VE AGREED NOT TO BUY A HOME UNTIL THEY FIND ONE THAT THEY ALL LIKE."
112,ep153,(Jeanette) I THOUGHT I'D SHOW THIS ONE TO YOU EVEN THOUGH IT'S A TWO-STORY.
113,ep153,IT'S SUCH A NICE HOUSE.
114,ep153,"(Lois) IT'S A REALLY NICE HOUSE, AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPED, BUT JEANETTE, IT'S A TWO-STORY HOUSE."
115,ep153,WE DON'T EVEN WANNA GO INSIDE AND LOOK.
116,ep153,NO MORE TWO-STORIES.
117,ep153,NO MORE TWO-STORIES.
118,ep153,NO... AGREE.
119,ep153,NO... AGREE.
120,ep153,"LET'S LOOK AT SOME MORE, PREFERABLY SINGLE STORIES."
121,ep153,ALL RIGHT.
122,ep153,(Suzanne) AT LEAST THEY ALL AGREE ON WHAT THEY DON'T WANT-- ANOTHER TWO-STORY HOME WITH HARD-TO-CLIMB STAIRS.
123,ep153,(Jeanette) THIS IS A SINGLE- STORY HOUSE HERE.
124,ep153,I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS ONE.
125,ep153,YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE ONE THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING INSIDE?
126,ep153,"OH, NO, JEANETTE, I DON'T THINK SO."
127,ep153,"I LIKE PEACE AND QUIET, AND THIS SEEMS TO BE AN AREA WHERE THE FAMILIES ARE MUCH YOUNGER."
128,ep153,I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND A BUNCH OF LITTLE KIDS.
129,ep153,I JUST COULDN'T SEE MYSELF LIVING HERE.
130,ep153,OKAY. I GOT PLENTY MORE I CAN SHOW YOU.
131,ep153,OKAY... LOOK.
132,ep153,OKAY... LOOK.
133,ep153,ALL RIGHT.
134,ep153,ALL RIGHT.
135,ep153,"AH, THIS IS THE KITCHEN."
136,ep153,AND THE LIVING ROOM HERE.
137,ep153,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
138,ep153,I DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT'S SET UP.
139,ep153,IT'S NOT MY TASTE.
140,ep153,IT'S NOT MY TASTE.
141,ep153,"AND, UH..."
142,ep153,"AND, UH..."
143,ep153,THIS KITCHEN NEEDS TOO MUCH WORK.
144,ep153,I CAN'T GET WITH THIS.
145,ep153,IT JUST DOES NOTHING FOR ME.
146,ep153,IT'S NOT MY TASTE.
147,ep153,"(Suzanne) AFTER A LONG DAY OF HOUSE HUNTING, THE WOMEN ARE MORE SURE THAN EVER ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT."
148,ep153,SOME OF THE HOMES ON JEANETTE'S LIST CAN BE CROSSED OFF WITHOUT EVEN GOING INSIDE.
149,ep153,(Jeanette) YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE ONE THAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN LOOKING INSIDE?
150,ep153,"OH, NO, JEANETTE, I DON'T THINK SO."
151,ep153,"(Suzanne) ELISHA, BERTHA AND LOIS HAVE SEEN A LOT OF HOMES TODAY, BUT NONE THAT HAS MET ALL THEIR NEEDS, SO THE SEARCH CONTINUES."
152,ep153,"AS FRUSTRATION SETTLES IN, WILL THESE THREE GENERATIONS BE ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING THAT THEY ALL LIKE?"
153,ep153,OR WILL THEY END UP HAVING TO COMPROMISE ON SOME OF THE THINGS THEY WANT?
154,ep153,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
155,ep153,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
156,ep153,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
157,ep153,"BERTHA, LOIS AND ELISHA ARE A THREE-GENERATION FAMILY WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME TO SHARE."
158,ep153,"THESE WOMEN ARE MOVING FROM THE SUBURBS BACK INTO THE CITY TO BE CLOSER TO JOBS, FRIENDS AND FAMILY."
159,ep153,BUT THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR HOUSE HUNTING IS DWINDLING AS THEY LOOK AT HOME AFTER HOME WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS.
160,ep153,"AFTER LOOKING AT NEARLY 50 HOUSES WITHOUT FINDING A SINGLE ONE THAT THEY ALL LIKED, THEIR OPTIONS ARE NARROWING, SO THEY AGREE TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT A HOME THEY'VE ALREADY SEEN."
161,ep153,"(Elisha) HEY, THEY PAINTED."
162,ep153,"(Jeanette) HEY, IT'S DIFFERENT."
163,ep153,REPLACED THE CARPETING.
164,ep153,REPLACED THE CARPETING.
165,ep153,"(Lois) OH, MY GOODNESS!"
166,ep153,"(Lois) OH, MY GOODNESS!"
167,ep153,LOOK AT THIS!
168,ep153,"OH, THIS REALLY LOOKS NICE NOW."
169,ep153,"(Suzanne) THE CURRENT OWNERS HAVE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE HOUSE SINCE THE FAMILY'S FIRST VISIT, AND THE RESULTS HAVE MADE THE HOUSE MUCH MORE APPEALING."
170,ep153,(Jeanette) LOOK AT THE KITCHEN.
171,ep153,(Jeanette) LOOK AT THE KITCHEN.
172,ep153,"OH, AND I LOVE THE PICTURE WINDOW!"
173,ep153,"OH, AND I LOVE THE PICTURE WINDOW!"
174,ep153,I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A HOUSE WITH A PICTURE WINDOW.
175,ep153,I LOVE THIS.
176,ep153,"(Suzanne) THE NEW PAINT, NEW CARPET AND OTHER COSMETIC CHANGES ADDED SINCE THE FAMILY TOURED THE HOME EIGHT WEEKS AGO HAVE CHANGED THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT THE HOME ENTIRELY."
177,ep153,"HERE IS YOUR DOUBLE OVEN, MOM."
178,ep153,"(Lois) OH, YEAH, THAT'S NICE."
179,ep153,I LIKE THAT.
180,ep153,AND THE COUNTERTOP BURNERS.
181,ep153,AND THE COUNTERTOP BURNERS.
182,ep153,"OH, THAT'S REALLY NICE."
183,ep153,"OH, THAT'S REALLY NICE."
184,ep153,I LIKE THAT AS WELL.
185,ep153,NEW DISHWASHER.
186,ep153,"OH, A SMALL KITCHEN, BUT IT HAS A LOT OF CABINET SPACE."
187,ep153,BUT IT HAS A LOT OF CABINET SPACE.
188,ep153,IT DOES.
189,ep153,IT DOES.
190,ep153,AND I LIKE THAT.
191,ep153,AND LOOK...
192,ep153,YOU HAVE INSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM.
193,ep153,(Bertha) THAT'LL BE CONVENIENT.
194,ep153,"(Suzanne) THE LAST TIME AROUND, THE FAMILY DIDN'T GET PAST THE KITCHEN BEFORE DECIDING THAT THE HOME NEEDED TOO MUCH WORK."
195,ep153,"NOW THAT THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE, THEY CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE."
196,ep153,"OOH, I THINK I JUST FOUND MY ROOM!"
197,ep153,"HEY, LET ME SEE!"
198,ep153,"OH, YEAH..."
199,ep153,THIS IS REALLY NICE.
200,ep153,"(Jeanette) AND LOOK, IT HAS RECESSED LIGHTING."
201,ep153,"OH, THAT'S NICE."
202,ep153,"OH, THAT'S NICE."
203,ep153,"OH, YEAH."
204,ep153,"OH, YEAH."
205,ep153,AND A BATHROOM WITH A SHOWER.
206,ep153,THIS IS MINE.
207,ep153,THIS IS MINE.
208,ep153,OKAY. CAN LIVE WITH THAT.
209,ep153,AND YOUR PATIO ENTRANCE LEADS RIGHT OUT INTO THE COURTYARD.
210,ep153,THAT'S NICE.
211,ep153,THAT'S NICE.
212,ep153,I LIKE THIS.
213,ep153,I LIKE THIS.
214,ep153,"HEY, LET'S GO AND CHECK OUT THE OTHER BEDROOMS AND SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE."
215,ep153,AND SEE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.
216,ep153,ALL RIGHT.
217,ep153,ALL RIGHT.
218,ep153,"(Suzanne) EVEN ELISHA, WHO HAS SO FAR BEEN THE HARDEST TO IMPRESS, IS EXCITED, BUT HERS IS ONLY ONE VOTE OUT OF THREE."
219,ep153,"(Elisha) OH, THIS IS A NICE SIZE ROOM."
220,ep153,"(Lois) YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
221,ep153,THIS IS A NICE ROOM.
222,ep153,"OH, I THINK THIS WOULD MAKE A GOOD ROOM FOR DEAR."
223,ep153,"OH, I THINK THIS WOULD MAKE A GOOD ROOM FOR DEAR."
224,ep153,"YEAH. BERTHA, WHO HER DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER AFFECTIONATELY CALL DEAR, ALSO FINDS A BEDROOM TO SUIT HER."
225,ep153,(Lois) LET'S SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
226,ep153,"OH, AND THIS IS THE SECOND BATHROOM."
227,ep153,IT'S A NICE SIZE BATHROOM.
228,ep153,IT'S A NICE SIZE BATHROOM.
229,ep153,IT IS.
230,ep153,IT IS.
231,ep153,WHAT DO YOU THINK...
232,ep153,NICE? DO YOU THINK...
233,ep153,NICE? LOIS IS HAPPY THAT HER MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER ARE BOTH PLEASED WITH THIS HOUSE SO FAR.
234,ep153,BUT WILL THE THIRD BEDROOM FIT HER NEEDS?
235,ep153,THIS IS A NICE...
236,ep153,"LOTS OF CLOSET SPACE, SHELVES."
237,ep153,"(Elisha) IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR BED, ALSO."
238,ep153,"OH, YEAH."
239,ep153,THAT WAY WE CAN ALL HAVE A NICE SIZE BEDROOM.
240,ep153,THAT WAY WE CAN ALL HAVE A NICE SIZE BEDROOM.
241,ep153,THAT'S TRUE.
242,ep153,THAT'S TRUE.
243,ep153,"(Suzanne) FINALLY, A HOUSE THAT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE-- A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD FOR LOIS, A PRIVATE MASTER SUITE FOR ELISHA, AND FOR BERTHA, A BACKYARD PERFECT FOR A VEGETABLE GARDEN."
244,ep153,"(Jeanette) THIS IS LIKE THE COURTYARD AREA, AND THE NICE PART ABOUT IT IS YOU CAN GET TO IT FROM YOUR LIVING ROOM, YOUR MASTER BEDROOM, AND THIS BEDROOM AS WELL."
245,ep153,(Elisha) LOOKS LIKE THERE MIGHT JUST BE SPACE FOR A GARDEN BACK HERE.
246,ep153,"(Bertha) OH, YEAH."
247,ep153,"(Bertha) OH, YEAH."
248,ep153,(Lois) AND IT'S FENCED OFF.
249,ep153,(Lois) AND IT'S FENCED OFF.
250,ep153,"AND THEN IT'S GOOD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE GATE, SO WE CAN HAVE THE DOG BACK HERE AND THE GARDEN ON THE OTHER SIDE."
251,ep153,AND THE GARDEN ON THE OTHER SIDE.
252,ep153,"YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT."
253,ep153,"YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT."
254,ep153,"(Jeanette) AND SEE, YOU HAVE A BLOCK WALL FENCE THERE THAT'S ALL AROUND THE HOUSE THAT'S ALREADY IN."
255,ep153,(Lois) THAT'S NICE...
256,ep153,THAT'S NICE.
257,ep153,OKAY. RIGHT.
258,ep153,ALL RIGHT.
259,ep153,COME ON...
260,ep153,LET ME TAKE YOU BACK INSIDE NOW.
261,ep153,YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR FULL COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR...
262,ep153,"OKAY? RIGHT, I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU ALL NOW TO DO YOUR FINAL OBSERVATIONS AND LAST LOOK AROUND."
263,ep153,"AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, DON'T HESITATE TO ASK ME ANYTHING."
264,ep153,"IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY, I WILL."
265,ep153,OKAY? RIGHT...
266,ep153,THANKS. RIGHT...
267,ep153,THANKS. RIGHT...
268,ep153,THANKS. I THINK I COULD ACTUALLY LIKE THIS ROOM.
269,ep153,"AFTER ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN, I THINK THAT THIS COULD BE THE ONE."
270,ep153,"SO HOPEFULLY, MY MOM WILL AGREE, AND WE CAN MAKE AN OFFER, BECAUSE I REALLY DO LIKE THE HOUSE, AND I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO OFFER EVERYONE."
271,ep153,"AFTER LOOKING AT SO MANY HOUSES, I REALLY THINK MAYBE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE ONE FOR US."
272,ep153,I'M HOPING SO.
273,ep153,"I'M GOING TO TALK TO THEM AND DISCUSS IT WITH THEM, AND THEN WE'LL MAKE A FINAL DECISION."
274,ep153,BUT I'M KIND OF THINKING MAYBE THIS IS GOING TO BE IT.
275,ep153,"(Suzanne) EVEN BERTHA FEELS POSITIVE ABOUT THE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY THE KITCHEN AND THE GARDEN AREA."
276,ep153,"AS THE GROUP LEAVES, IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY ALL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE HOUSE."
277,ep153,BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A DECISION TOO HASTILY.
278,ep153,THE FAMILY NEEDS SOME TIME TO THINK IT OVER.
279,ep153,(Jeanette) OKAY.
280,ep153,"LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, AND WHEN CAN I EXPECT TO HEAR BACK FROM YOU?"
281,ep153,"OH, I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL TOMORROW."
282,ep153,"WE'RE GONNA GO HOME AND DISCUSS IT, AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW SOMETHING DEFINITE TOMORROW, BECAUSE WE REALLY THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE HOUSE."
283,ep153,OKAY. I KNOW FOR SURE I LIKE IT.
284,ep153,"WELL, I KNOW FOR SURE I LIKE IT."
285,ep153,"OH, THAT'S GOOD..."
286,ep153,I LIKE HEARING THAT.
287,ep153,"OKAY, SO WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL TOMORROW."
288,ep153,"OKAY, SO WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL TOMORROW."
289,ep153,OKAY. RIGHT.

305,ep153,"WELL, I MEAN, FOR ME..."
306,ep153,"I THINK IT'S PERFECT, YOU KNOW?"
307,ep153,IT KIND OF HAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN LOOKING FOR.
308,ep153,"BUT YOU KNOW, THE FINAL DECISION IS YOURS."
309,ep153,THE FINAL DECISION IS OURS.
310,ep153,THE FINAL DECISION IS OURS.
311,ep153,"WELL, BUT STILL, WELL, BUT STILL, IF YOU'RE HAPPY, YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY, SO..."
312,ep153,OKAY... WE CAN ALWAYS DISCUSS IT AT LENGTH ONCE WE GET HOME.
313,ep153,ONCE WE GET HOME.
314,ep153,OKAY. MAKE A FINAL DECISION FROM THERE.
315,ep153,AND MAKE A FINAL DECISION FROM THERE.
316,ep153,BUT I REALLY THINK THIS MIGHT BE IT.
317,ep153,BUT I REALLY THINK THIS MIGHT BE IT.
318,ep153,"(Suzanne) AND THEY'VE GOT A LONG DRIVE HOME TO DECIDE IF THEY FINALLY FOUND THE IMPOSSIBLE, A HOME THAT WINS ALL THEIR APPROVAL."
319,ep153,"AFTER LOOKING AT DOZENS OF HOUSES, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COMES CLOSE TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF THESE THREE DISCERNING WOMEN."
320,ep153,BUT IS IT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM TO MAKE AN OFFER?
321,ep153,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
322,ep153,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
323,ep153,"GRANDMOTHER BERTHA, MOTHER LOIS AND DAUGHTER ELISHA ARE MOVING FROM THE SUBURBS BACK INTO THE CITY TO SHORTEN THEIR COMMUTE."
324,ep153,THESE THREE GENERATIONS HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE ONE HOUSE THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THEIR NEEDS.
325,ep153,"AFTER SEEING THE HOUSE, EACH OF THE WOMEN HAVE FORMED AN OPINION."
326,ep153,NOW IT'S TIME TO DISCUSS THEM.
327,ep153,"NOW THAT WE CHECKED OUT THIS HOUSE, IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING, A LITTLE BIT, FOR EVERYBODY."
328,ep153,I LIKE THAT ROOM TO MYSELF.
329,ep153,I THINK IT'S ONE THAT WE CAN ALL BE HAPPY WITH.
330,ep153,"THE BEDROOMS, OUR BEDROOMS, WILL BE SEPARATE FROM YOURS."
331,ep153,IT HAS THE OTHER THREE BEDROOMS THAT'S ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.
332,ep153,WE CAN TAKE ONE OF THOSE BEDROOMS AND TURN IT INTO A FAMILY ROOM.
333,ep153,"AND THE BACKYARD IS JUST ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE DOG TO RUN, AND THEN WE CAN GATE THE SIDES OFF."
334,ep153,"DO A GARDEN FOR DEAR ON THE SIDE, IF SHE WANTS."
335,ep153,IF SHE WANTS.
336,ep153,"(Bertha) YES, MA'AM."
337,ep153,"(Bertha) YES, MA'AM."
338,ep153,IT'S ABOUT TIME I HAD ME A GARDEN.

345,ep153,"WHAT DO YOU THINK, MOM."
346,ep153,FINE WITH ME.
347,ep153,FINE WITH ME.
348,ep153,OKAY... WHAT DO YOU SAY?
349,ep153,HEY! DO THIS.
350,ep153,LET'S DO THIS.
351,ep153,"OKAY, BACK TO THE CITY!"
352,ep153,SHORTER DRIVE.
353,ep153,SHORTER DRIVE.
354,ep153,THAT'S FOR SURE.
355,ep153,THAT'S FOR SURE.
356,ep153,"BACK TO THE CITY, BABE."
357,ep153,NOT TOO SOON FOR ME.
358,ep153,"(Suzanne) ONCE THE OFFER IS MADE, THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS WAIT FOR THE PHONE TO RING."
359,ep153,"(phone ringing) FORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG."
360,ep153,(Lois) HELLO?
361,ep153,"OH, GREAT!"
362,ep153,WONDERFUL... YOU!
363,ep153,"OH, YES, I WILL!"
364,ep153,"DEAR, WE GOT THE HOUSE!"
365,ep153,"(Suzanne) AFTER SPENDING SIX MONTHS LOOKING AT OVER 50 HOMES, THESE THREE WOMEN HAVE FOUND THEIR ONE PERFECT HOUSE."
366,ep153,"(Lois) ALL RIGHT, THEN, BYE-BYE."
367,ep153,"(Suzanne) AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT TOOK THEM TO FIND THE HOUSE, BERTHA, LOIS AND ELISHA HAVE MOVED BACK INTO THE CITY, HAPPY TO HAVE LEFT THEIR COMMUTE BEHIND."
368,ep153,"I DEFINITELY DON'T MISS THE DRIVE, BECAUSE I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS USUALLY CAUGHT UP IN THE HEAVY TRAFFIC, AND NOW IT'S LIKE WHEN I LEAVE WORK, I RARELY DEAL WITH ANY TRAFFIC."
369,ep153,SO I'M LOVING THAT.
370,ep153,(Suzanne) LOIS ALSO LOVES BEING CLOSER TO HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOW THAT SHE'S GONE FROM LONG DISTANCE TO LOCAL.
371,ep153,"ELISHA, TOO, IS HAPPY WITH THE HOUSE."
372,ep153,(Elisha) I FINALLY HAVE MY OWN SPACE.
373,ep153,"MY ROOM IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE--I LIKE THAT-- WITH MY OWN BATHROOM, SO I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST RELAX IN MY ROOM, ENJOY MY MUSIC OR TV."
374,ep153,"OR IF MY FRIENDS COME OVER, YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY OWN AREA AWAY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE AND JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX."
375,ep153,IT'S REALLY NICE.
376,ep153,"SO I FEEL LIKE I LIVE BY MYSELF, BUT I LIVE WITH MY FAMILY, SO IT'S COOL."
377,ep153,(Suzanne) BERTHA IS DELIGHTED WITH HER NEW KITCHEN AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE SPRING PLANTING SEASON WHEN SHE CAN START HER BACKYARD GARDEN.
378,ep153,"(Elisha) YEAH, I'M HAPPY WITH THE HOME PURCHASE."
379,ep153,I THINK WE MADE A GOOD CHOICE OF WHAT WE SAW AND WHAT WAS OUT THERE.
380,ep153,I THINK WE MADE THE BEST CHOICE FOR US.
381,ep153,I THINK IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE.
382,ep153,WE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
383,ep153,"FOR THESE WOMEN, HOUSE HUNTING WAS AN INVESTMENT OF TIME AS WELL AS MONEY."
384,ep153,"AND LIKE ALL GOOD INVESTMENTS, THIS ONE HAS PAID OFF HANDSOMELY, IN A HOME THAT MOTHER, DAUGHTER AND GRANDMOTHER CAN ALL ENJOY FOR YEARS TO COME."
385,ep153,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.

1,ep154,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep154,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep154,MEG AND BRIAN PUCCINELLI ARE LOOKING FOR A HOME IN WHICH TO RAISE THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN.
4,ep154,"THOUGH BRIAN AND MEG LOVE THEIR CURRENT NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT SCHOOLS AND GIVING THEIR KIDS THE KIND OF HOME THEY HAD, GROWING UP."
5,ep154,"THEIR HOUSE IS ALREADY SOLD, SO THE PRESSURE IS ON TO FIND A NEW HOME QUICKLY."
6,ep154,CAN THEY DO IT?
7,ep154,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep154,♪♪ BRIAN AND MEG PUCCINELLI WANT TO FIND A HOUSE WITH MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE AND A BIGGER LOT.
9,ep154,"AFTER THREE YEARS IN THEIR CURRENT HOUSE, THE COUPLE IS EAGER TO FIND A MORE LONG-TERM HOME FOR THEIR FAMILY."
10,ep154,"I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR, IN THIS NEW HOME, SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GROW WITH AND SOMEWHERE THAT BRIAN AND I CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE RAISING OUR TWO CHILDREN INTO HIGH SCHOOL AGE AND INTO COLLEGE."
11,ep154,"(Suzanne) SINCE MEG AND BRIAN HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD FOR SEVERAL YEARS, THEY'VE GROWN ATTACHED TO THE AREA AND THEIR NEIGHBORS."
12,ep154,"(Meg) SO IT'S KIND OF NICE TO SEE FAMILIAR FACES WHEREVER YOU GO, AND WE WALK A LOT AND BIKE RIDE."
13,ep154,"AND JUST KNOWING THE AREA, IT'S A SAFE AREA."
14,ep154,I THINK THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE.
15,ep154,(Suzanne) BUT THERE IS ONE THING THE PUCCINELLIS ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH-- THE TRAFFIC.
16,ep154,"(Brian) I THINK SINCE WE'VE HAD CHILDREN, OUR ONLY CONCERN HAS BEEN THAT IT IS A LITTLE BUSY IN THE MORNING TIME OR THE EVENINGS."
17,ep154,"TILL WE HAD TWO LITTLE KIDS, IT WASN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL, BECAUSE YOU GET USED TO IT--IT'S NOT THAT BAD."
18,ep154,"BUT NOW, WITH KIDS, YOU WORRY ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING."
19,ep154,"(Meg) IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A FREEWAY OUT THERE, BUT IT'S A LITTLE BUSY."
20,ep154,(Suzanne) ONE OF THE FEATURES THE PUCCINELLIS ENJOY IS THE FLOOR PLAN OF THEIR HOUSE.
21,ep154,"(Meg) THIS HOUSE, WE REALLY LIKE, I THINK, BECAUSE OF THE LAYOUT."
22,ep154,IT'S A REALLY NICE LAYOUT.
23,ep154,ALL THE BEDROOMS ARE UPSTAIRS.
24,ep154,"IT HAS A FAMILY ROOM OFF OF THE KITCHEN, OFF OF THE KITCHENETTE, WHERE YOU CAN EAT BREAKFAST OR DINNER AND THEN, YOU KNOW, BE HERE IN THE FAMILY ROOM, AND THEN THE YARD'S RIGHT OFF OF THE FAMILY ROOM."
25,ep154,THE KIDS LOVE THE PATIO.
26,ep154,THEY SPEND HOURS OUTSIDE ON THIS LITTLE PATIO BACK HERE.
27,ep154,"(Suzanne) THE PATIO IS A HIT WITH HANNAH AND HAYLEY, BUT BRIAN AND MEG WANT MORE FOR THEIR GIRLS."
28,ep154,I WAS RAISED WITH A HUGE YARD...
29,ep154,MY WIFE WAS RAISED WITH A HUGE YARD...
30,ep154,"AND I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT AS A KID, SO WE'D KIND OF LIKE TO OFFER THAT TO OUR KIDS."
31,ep154,YOU GUYS WANT...
32,ep154,"HANNAH, YOU WANT SANDWICHES?"
33,ep154,"YOUR FAVORITE, TURKEY?"
34,ep154,"THAT SOUNDS GREAT, HONEY."
35,ep154,ALL RIGHT.
36,ep154,(Suzanne) MORE ROOM IN THE KITCHEN WOULD ALSO HELP THIS FAMILY.
37,ep154,"BIG KITCHEN, BIG YARD, POOL, RANCH-STYLE..."
38,ep154,WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR TOO MUCH...
39,ep154,ARE WE?
40,ep154,THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
41,ep154,"(Suzanne) A MAJORITY OF THE PUCCINELLIS' TIME IS SPENT IN THEIR FAMILY ROOM, KITCHEN AND PATIO WHILE THE LIVING ROOM AND DINING ROOM ARE RARELY USED."

43,ep154,"WE'D KIND OF LIKE TO RELIVE OUR CHILDHOOD, I GUESS, FOR OUR KIDS, IS WHAT WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING FOR."
44,ep154,(Suzanne) BRIAN AND MEG ARE ALSO LOOKING TO IMPROVE UPON THEIR WORKSPACE AT HOME.
45,ep154,"RIGHT NOW BRIAN'S DESK IS IN THE GUEST ROOM, AND MEG WORKS OUT OF THE MASTER BEDROOM."
46,ep154,"(Meg) SO IT WILL BE NICE HAVING A SEPARATE ROOM THAT WE CAN PUT BOTH OF OUR COMPUTERS IN, JUST IF WE DID NEED TO CRANK AND DO A BUNCH OF WORK, THAT WE COULD GO AND ISOLATE OURSELVES THERE."
47,ep154,(Suzanne) THE LAST THING ON MEG AND BRIAN'S LIST IS FINDING A MOVE-IN READY HOME.
48,ep154,"BUT WITH LOTS OF OLDER HOMES ON THE MARKET, FINDING ONE IN GOOD CONDITION MAY BE A CHALLENGE."
49,ep154,"HELPING THE PUCCINELLIS FIND THE IDEAL HOME ARE THEIR GOOD FRIENDS AND SEASONED REALTORS, ROXANNE AND BRUCE ELLISON."
50,ep154,ALREADY THE ELLISONS KNOW THE PUCCINELLIS' SEARCH FOR A MOVE-IN READY HOME WILL BE A TOUGH ONE.
51,ep154,THE HOUSES IN THE AREA THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SHOWING THEM ARE PRIMARILY 30- TO 40-YEAR-OLD HOMES.
52,ep154,"A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN UPGRADED, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA SHOW THEM, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE HOMES HAVE NOT BEEN UPGRADED YET."
53,ep154,"MEG AND BRIAN HAVE EXCEPTIONAL, NATURAL STYLE, AND I THINK THE HARDEST THING FOR THEM IS GOING TO BE LOOKING THROUGH HOMES THAT ARE DATED."
54,ep154,"AND EVEN LOOKING THROUGH HOMES THAT ARE FIXED UP, I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE THEIR ESSENCE OF STYLE QUITE TO THEIR DEGREE THAT THEY'RE USED TO."
55,ep154,SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A HOUSE THAT'S ALREADY DONE.
56,ep154,THAT'S OUR GOAL.
57,ep154,"BUT WE KNOW ON THE FLIP SIDE, WE MAY HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO IT."
58,ep154,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, THE PUCCINELLIS FIND SOMETHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT..."
59,ep154,"OH, MY GOSH, HOW CUTE!"
60,ep154,ISN'T IT CUTE?
61,ep154,(Suzanne) STAY TUNED.
62,ep154,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
63,ep154,MEG AND BRIAN PUCCINELLI ARE ANXIOUS TO FIND THE HOME OF THEIR DREAMS WHERE THEY CAN RAISE THEIR CHILDREN AND LIVE COMFORTABLY FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.
64,ep154,"FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, THE FAMILY HAS BEEN QUITE HAPPY IN THEIR TWO-STORY, FOUR-BEDROOM HOME."
65,ep154,"BUT AS THE CHILDREN GET OLDER, THE SPACE IS GETTING SMALLER, AND THE SEARCH FOR A LARGER HOME BEGINS."
66,ep154,"KNOWING THAT THE PUCCINELLIS WANT A HOME THAT'S IN MOVE-IN CONDITION, REALTORS BRUCE AND ROXANNE ELLISON HEAD OUT WITH THE COUPLE TO SHOW THEM WHAT'S ON THE MARKET THAT FITS THE BILL."
67,ep154,HELLO! VERY PRETTY.
68,ep154,WELL? YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LOVE THIS HOUSE.
69,ep154,IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
70,ep154,EVERYTHING'S BEEN REDONE.
71,ep154,(Roxanne) ISN'T IT GREAT?
72,ep154,"(Brian) YEAH, IT'S GREAT."
73,ep154,IT'S DONE DOWN TO THE BASEBOARDS.
74,ep154,THERE ISN'T A THING YOU HAVE TO DO TO THIS HOME.
75,ep154,(Meg) WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO A THING TO IT...
76,ep154,THAT'S NICE.
77,ep154,NOPE... IN...
78,ep154,PUT YOUR FEET UP.
79,ep154,DEFINITE BONUS.
80,ep154,"ISN'T THIS A GREAT KITCHEN, MEG?"
81,ep154,"OH, IT'S SO PRETTY!"
82,ep154,VERY OPEN.
83,ep154,ISN'T IT?
84,ep154,YEAH. THESE GRANITE COUNTERS ARE REALLY NICE.
85,ep154,IT'S A NICE FEEL...
86,ep154,ISN'T IT?
87,ep154,YEAH. A BEAUTIFUL FOCAL POINT.
88,ep154,"I LIKE THIS BUILT- IN BENCH, TOO."
89,ep154,"IT'D BE GREAT FOR THE GIRLS, BRIAN."
90,ep154,IT'D BE GREAT.
91,ep154,"WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE PARTIES, EVERYBODY'S IN YOUR KITCHEN ANYWAY, RIGHT."
92,ep154,YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE ALL THIS SEATING IN HERE WITH THIS AND THE EXTRA BAR SEATING THERE.
93,ep154,AMAZING STOVE...
94,ep154,THAT'S A GOURMET STOVE THERE.
95,ep154,I DEFINITELY CAN USE THAT.
96,ep154,THAT WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE CARE OF THAT.
97,ep154,THIS IS NICE...
98,ep154,"YEAH, VERY NICE."
99,ep154,THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.
100,ep154,AND OVER HERE WE'VE GOT THE TWO KIDS' ROOMS.
101,ep154,GREAT... NEED THOSE.
102,ep154,"OH, MY GOSH, HOW CUTE!"
103,ep154,ISN'T THAT CUTE?
104,ep154,VERY CUTE.
105,ep154,NOW LET ME SHOW YOU THIS MASTER.
106,ep154,WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS ROOM.
107,ep154,"I LOVE THAT ROOM, THOUGH."
108,ep154,IT'S SO CUTE FOR THE GIRLS.
109,ep154,"LET'S CHECK OUT THIS MASTER, GUYS."
110,ep154,IT'S GOT IT'S OWN BUILT-IN OFFICE.
111,ep154,"OH, I LIKE IT."
112,ep154,THAT'S NICE.
113,ep154,LOT OF STORAGE SPACE.
114,ep154,YEAH. COULD WORK RIGHT THERE.
115,ep154,PAY THE BILLS RIGHT THERE.
116,ep154,"YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, PAY BILLS."
117,ep154,AND A GREAT MASTER.
118,ep154,"OH, MY GOSH, IT'S HUGE!"
119,ep154,"OH, I REALLY LIKE THIS ROOM."
120,ep154,I LIKE THE HIGH CEILINGS.
121,ep154,AND THE AREA FOR THE LARGE SCREEN TV.
122,ep154,THAT'S NICE.
123,ep154,"YEAH, 'CAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE SCREEN TV."
124,ep154,THAT'D BE PERFECT.
125,ep154,AND THE MIRRORED CLOSETS.
126,ep154,THEN WE GOT A MASTER BATH OVER HERE THAT'S REALLY BEEN NICELY REDONE.
127,ep154,OKAY. IT IS PRETTY...
128,ep154,I REALLY LIKE IT.
129,ep154,"(Roxanne) ISN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL MASTER BATH, MEG?"
130,ep154,"OH, IT IS."
131,ep154,IT HAS THE WINDOW GOING OUT TO THE GARDEN AND THEN THE HIGH CEILINGS.
132,ep154,(Bruce) THEY DID A GREAT JOB ON THAT.
133,ep154,I REALLY LIKE IT.
134,ep154,LET'S GO LOOK AT THE YARD.
135,ep154,OKAY. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE YARD.
136,ep154,"(Suzanne) THIS HOME LACKS A FOURTH BEDROOM THAT COULD BE USED AS MEG AND BRIAN'S HOME OFFICE, BUT IF THE BACKYARD IS SOMETHING SPECIAL, THEY MAY OVERLOOK THAT FLAW."
137,ep154,"OH, WHAT A GREAT YARD."
138,ep154,THE LANDSCAPE IS WONDERFUL.
139,ep154,ISN'T IT...
140,ep154,GREAT TREES.
141,ep154,"OH, YEAH."
142,ep154,THE CLIMBING ROSES...
143,ep154,IT'S VERY PRETTY.
144,ep154,"(Brian) AND THE LAWN'S NICE FOR KIDS, BUT I'D DEFINITELY LIKE TO GET A POOL."
145,ep154,IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE WANNA GET.
146,ep154,"(Suzanne) THIS PLACE IS MOVE-IN READY, BIT WITHOUT A POOL AND THE NEEDED EXTRA BEDROOM FOR AN OFFICE, THE GROUP DECIDES TO MOVE ON."
147,ep154,THE EIGHTH HOUSE ON THEIR LIST HAS ALSO BEEN UPDATED AND BEAUTIFULLY REMODELED.
148,ep154,"IT HAS A SOUTHWESTERN FEEL BOTH INSIDE AND OUT, WHICH ROXANNE THINKS WILL APPEAL TO MEG AND BRIAN."
149,ep154,"OH, WHAT A WONDERFUL ENTRANCE."
150,ep154,"LOOK AT THIS GRANITE, BRIAN."
151,ep154,(Bruce) ISN'T IT PRETTY?
152,ep154,(Brian) IT IS.
153,ep154,YEAH... AGAINST THE WOOD.
154,ep154,THE WOOD FLOORS LOOK GREAT.
155,ep154,(Roxanne) AND THE WOOD TRIM GOES THROUGH THE WHOLE HOUSE.
156,ep154,ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE?
157,ep154,THIS HAS A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM WITH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ENTERTAINMENT AREAS RIGHT IN THE SAME ROOM.
158,ep154,I LIKE IT.
159,ep154,IT'S VERY OPEN.
160,ep154,"(Brian) YEAH, IT'S BIG."
161,ep154,VERY LIGHT...
162,ep154,VERY NICE.
163,ep154,AND OUR FURNITURE WOULD LOOK GOOD IN HERE.
164,ep154,(Bruce) LET ME SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN.
165,ep154,GREAT. THINK YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE THIS.
166,ep154,"WELL, ANOTHER GREAT KITCHEN FOR BRIAN TO COOK IN."
167,ep154,ABSOLUTELY. ALL LIKE THIS.
168,ep154,"THIS IS REAL FUNCTIONAL, BRIAN, WITH THE ISLAND LIKE THIS."
169,ep154,"OH, YEAH..."
170,ep154,THAT'S NICE.
171,ep154,WE HAVE THE VEGETABLE SINK HERE.
172,ep154,THERE'S EVEN A GARBAGE DISPOSAL IN THE VEGETABLE SINK.
173,ep154,AND THE ISLAND'S REAL FUNCTIONAL.
174,ep154,"BY HAVING THE ISLAND OUT HERE, YOU CAN DO PREP WORK AND YOUR CHOPPING OVER HERE AND CLEANUP OVER THERE AT THE SAME TIME."
175,ep154,"WOW, THAT'S NICE."
176,ep154,WE HAVE ALWAYS WANTED AN ISLAND.
177,ep154,"YOU KNOW, I NOTICED, THOUGH, IT HAS THE DINING ROOM OFF OF THE KITCHEN VERSUS A FAMILY ROOM, AND WE USE THE FAMILY ROOM..."
178,ep154,YEAH. FAMILY ROOM'S REAL IMPORTANT.
179,ep154,JUST 'CAUSE WITH THE TWO GIRLS AND JUST KIND OF HAVING THAT COMMAND CENTRAL.
180,ep154,WE BASICALLY LIVE THERE.
181,ep154,REALLY? YOU NEED A FAMILY ROOM.
182,ep154,THAT'S IMPORTANT.
183,ep154,YEAH. BE KIND OF NICE IF THE TWO WENT TOGETHER SOMEHOW.
184,ep154,ALL RIGHT...
185,ep154,"WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU THE CHILDREN'S WING..."
186,ep154,OKAY. IT IS SEPARATED.
187,ep154,ALL RIGHT.
188,ep154,OKAY. HAVE A FULL BATH HERE FOR THE GIRLS WITH A BATHTUB.
189,ep154,"OH, AND ANOTHER LITTLE ROOM OVER HERE."
190,ep154,"AND ANOTHER BEDROOM, AND IT'S GOOD SIZED, SO I THOUGH MAYBE WE WOULD CONSIDER SHARING A BEDROOM WITH THE GIRLS AND KEEPING THE OFFICE FOR BRIAN."
191,ep154,"OH, I DON'T THINK THAT'LL WORK WITH OUR KIDS."
192,ep154,NO? THEY'RE ON DIFFERENT SCHEDULES.
193,ep154,OKAY. DEFINITELY...
194,ep154,WE'D NEED ANOTHER BEDROOM.
195,ep154,ALL RIGHT.
196,ep154,"SO THAT MEANS WE'RE SHY A BEDROOM, AGAIN."
197,ep154,"YEAH, BUT WE HAVE A POOL."
198,ep154,OKAY. AT LEAST SEE THE POOL.
199,ep154,SO LET'S LOOK AT THAT.
200,ep154,OKAY. PATIO LIVING HERE.
201,ep154,"WOW, THAT'S NICE..."
202,ep154,THAT'S A NICE POOL.
203,ep154,"(Meg) OH, HOW GREAT WOULD THIS BE FOR THE GIRLS?"
204,ep154,ISN'T IT?
205,ep154,"OH, THIS IS WONDERFUL!"
206,ep154,IT'S STILL A NICE LAWN AREA.
207,ep154,YEAH. YEAH!
208,ep154,"(Suzanne) BUT WITHOUT A FOURTH BEDROOM OR A FAMILY ROOM OFF THE KITCHEN, THE POOL DOES LITTLE FOR THEM."
209,ep154,"I STILL THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT FOURTH BEDROOM, JUST BECAUSE WE WORK OUT OF THE HOUSE, AND I THINK..."
210,ep154,"WELL, THAT'S TRUE."
211,ep154,"I MEAN, WE..."
212,ep154,YEAH. USE IT AS AN OFFICE.
213,ep154,YEAH. WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT FINDING A BIGGER HOUSE THEN.
214,ep154,"I MEAN, WE COULD FIND A HOUSE LIKE THIS WITH THE EXTRA BEDROOM, WOULD BE NICE."
215,ep154,IT WOULD...
216,ep154,YEAH. RIGHT.
217,ep154,LET'S KEEP LOOKING.
218,ep154,LET'S KEEP LOOKING.
219,ep154,"(Suzanne) AS THEIR WANTS AND NEEDS GROW, THE NUMBER OF MOVE-IN READY HOUSES ON THE MARKET SHRINKS."
220,ep154,"TO FIND A HOME THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH, MEG AND BRIAN WILL HAVE TO START LOOKING AT HOUSES THAT NEED WORK."
221,ep154,WILL IT WORK OUT?
222,ep154,"OH, GOSH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT!"
223,ep154,(Suzanne) FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
224,ep154,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
225,ep154,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
226,ep154,BRIAN AND MEG PUCCINELLI HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HOMES FOR OVER A MONTH.
227,ep154,"SINCE THEIR CURRENT HOUSE HAS SOLD, THEY'RE EAGER TO FIND THE PERFECT FOUR-BEDROOM HOME FOR THEIR FAMILY."
228,ep154,BUT THEY'VE EXHAUSTED THE LISTINGS OF HOMES THAT ARE MOVE-IN READY WITHOUT FINDING ONE THAT MEETS ALL THEIR CRITERIA.
229,ep154,SO THE COUPLE HAS BROADENED THEIR QUEST TO INCLUDE FIXERS.
230,ep154,MEG GOES OUT WITH REALTOR BRUCE ELLISON TO SCOUT THE LATEST FIND WHILE BRIAN WATCHES THE COUPLE'S TWO GIRLS.
231,ep154,NOW THIS HOUSE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONES THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT.
232,ep154,THIS ONE'S NOT FIXED UP.
233,ep154,"THIS ONE IS A FIXER, AND I THINK IT'S GOT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS WERE LOOKING FOR."
234,ep154,OKAY. THE YARD'S VERY PRETTY...
235,ep154,NEW ROOF.
236,ep154,"IT'S GOT A LOT OF NICE THINGS TO IT, INCLUDING A GOOD FLOOR PLAN."
237,ep154,I'M SURE THAT THIS'LL BE PERFECT FOR YOU AND BRIAN TO DO THE CUSTOMIZING THINGS THAT YOU REALLY WANNA DO.
238,ep154,HELLO... HERE.
239,ep154,COME ON IN.
240,ep154,WOW! MY!
241,ep154,THIS IS GREAT.
242,ep154,"THIS IS A FLOOR PLAN LIKE YOU GUYS WERE ASKING ABOUT, TOO, WITH THE MASTER SUITE OVER HERE, THE KIDS' BEDROOMS DOWN HERE, THEN THIS BIG OPEN LIVING AREA."
243,ep154,I REALLY LIKE IT.
244,ep154,IT'S A GREAT FIREPLACE.
245,ep154,"OH, THIS IS VERY NICE."
246,ep154,IT'S GOT A GREAT BACKYARD WITH A SUPER POOL.
247,ep154,"OH, WOW!"
248,ep154,"OH, THIS IS FABULOUS!"
249,ep154,THIS IS GONNA BE WONDERFUL FOR ENTERTAINING.
250,ep154,IT'S SO PRETTY.
251,ep154,"OH, GOSH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT!"
252,ep154,THAT'S SO...
253,ep154,"WELL, THE PANELING DOES DATE IT."
254,ep154,IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.
255,ep154,YEAH. ON...
256,ep154,LET'S LOOK AT THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
257,ep154,"OKAY. AS BRUCE TAKES MEG THROUGH THE HOUSE, HE HELPS HER VISUALIZE WHAT IT COULD BE."
258,ep154,OKAY... THIS NEEDS SOME WORK.
259,ep154,WOULDN'T YOU SAY?
260,ep154,"YEAH. YOU GUYS DECIDE ON THIS HOUSE, WE COULD COME IN HERE..."
261,ep154,WE COULD TAKE OUT THE TILE.
262,ep154,"IN FACT, I LIKE THE BASIC LAYOUT."
263,ep154,I LOVE THE TWO SINKS.
264,ep154,I THINK THAT'S PERFECT FOR THE KIDS.
265,ep154,"OH, ABSOLUTELY."
266,ep154,"FOR BOTH HANNAH AND HAYLEY, THAT WOULD BE GREAT."
267,ep154,YEP. GO LOOK AT ONE OF THE BEDROOMS.
268,ep154,NOW THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD EXTRA BEDROOM FOR THE KIDS.
269,ep154,"OKAY, I CAN PICTURE THIS."
270,ep154,BED OVER THERE...
271,ep154,DESK OVER HERE...
272,ep154,"THIS WOULD BE A NICE LITTLE ROOM, NICE LITTLE ROOM FOR ONE OF THE GIRLS."
273,ep154,I COULD SEE THIS WORKING.
274,ep154,I THINK THIS IS REAL WORKABLE.
275,ep154,"OKAY. SO WORKABLE, IN FACT, THAT MEG DECIDES BRIAN SHOULD SEE THIS HOUSE RIGHT AWAY."
276,ep154,"ROXANNE ELLISON, THE OTHER HALF OF THEIR REALTOR TEAM, AGREES TO WATCH THE GIRLS WHILE MEG, BRIAN AND BRUCE RETURN TO THE HOUSE."
277,ep154,"OKAY, BRIAN, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS."
278,ep154,"IT REALLY IS PRETTY ON THE OUTSIDE, AND IT'S THE INSIDE THAT YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO USE YOUR IMAGINATION AND CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST DREAM OF HOW IT COULD BE."
279,ep154,(Bruce) WE CAN CUSTOMIZE THIS AND MAKE THIS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING FOR.
280,ep154,BUT THE OUTSIDE LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.
281,ep154,THE OUTSIDE IS PRETTY NICE.
282,ep154,THE ROOF LOOKS LIKE IT'S PRETTY NEW.
283,ep154,HELLO... IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONE.
284,ep154,COME ON IN.
285,ep154,"BRIAN, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE THIS HOUSE."
286,ep154,I THINK IT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.
287,ep154,"THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR, THAT OPEN AREA RANCH HOUSE."
288,ep154,"WOW, IT'S NICE AND OPEN, AND THE FIREPLACE IS SPECTACULAR."
289,ep154,IT'S REALLY NICE.
290,ep154,"THE FLOOR PLAN, I THINK, IS SOMETHING WE CAN REALLY WORK WITH."
291,ep154,COME ON...
292,ep154,LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.
293,ep154,"THERE'S SOME THINGS WITH EACH ROOM THAT NEED UPGRADING TO, BUT I THINK THAT OVERALL, IT'S A GOOD FEEL."
294,ep154,YEAH. THINK THE FLOOR PLAN IS REALLY GONNA BE USABLE.
295,ep154,"AND BRIAN, THIS IS YOUR ROOM."
296,ep154,I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO HERE...
297,ep154,I REALLY DO.
298,ep154,"I THINK IF WE LOSE THIS CUPBOARD AND KNOCK OUT THIS WALL, ADD SOME GRANITE, SOME NEW APPLIANCES, IT'S GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL ROOM FOR YOU TO COOK AND REALLY ENJOY AND..."
299,ep154,"GOSH, COMMAND CENTRAL..."
300,ep154,"IT'S RIGHT OUT THERE, I MEAN, PERFECT FOR ENTERTAINING WITH THE POOL THERE."
301,ep154,"YEAH, SHE SAYS YOU'RE QUITE THE GOURMET COOK."
302,ep154,"YEAH, I LOVE TO COOK."
303,ep154,"IT'S THERAPY FOR ME, AND THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'D BE THE PERFECT PLACE."
304,ep154,"(Suzanne) QUICKLY, BRIAN IS STARTING TO SEE THE POTENTIAL OF EACH ROOM."
305,ep154,"WELL, LET'S SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE."
306,ep154,ALL RIGHT...
307,ep154,COME ON.
308,ep154,"BRUCE, I REALLY LIKE THE FLOW SO FAR OF THE HOUSE."
309,ep154,"YEAH, IT'S REALLY NICE HAVING THE MASTER BEDROOM OVER ON THIS WING AWAY FROM THE CHILDREN'S WING, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER."
310,ep154,IT LOOKS NICE OVERLOOKING THE POOL AS WELL.
311,ep154,DIDN'T I TELL YOU YOU'D LIKE IT?
312,ep154,"YEAH, I DO, EXCEPT IT SEEMS A LITTLE DARK IN HERE."
313,ep154,"WELL, THAT'S THAT WOOD THING, AGAIN."
314,ep154,OKAY. DO NEED TO GET RID OF THE WOOD...
315,ep154,LOOK OVER HERE.
316,ep154,"WE'VE GOT A NICE BIG OFFICE OFF THE MASTER, TOO."
317,ep154,"OKAY, AND WE CAN OPEN THAT UP AS WELL, POSSIBLY, WITH EITHER PAINTING IT OR REMOVING THE WOOD."
318,ep154,"YEAH, THE CHANGES IN THIS OFFICE WOULD REALLY BE PRETTY EASY."
319,ep154,NOW THIS IS THE MASTER BATH OVER HERE.
320,ep154,IT'S A GOOD SIZE.
321,ep154,IT'S A VERY NICE SIZE.
322,ep154,"JUST NEEDS WORK, AGAIN."
323,ep154,LOTS OF OPTIONS.
324,ep154,LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN DO.
325,ep154,"A LITTLE GRANITE, SOME NEW FIXTURES, AND IT'LL BECOME YOUR TYPE OF BATHROOM, I'M SURE."
326,ep154,MORE OUR STYLE.
327,ep154,ABSOLUTELY. COME ON...
328,ep154,I WANNA SHOW YOU GUYS THE POOL.
329,ep154,YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THE POOL.
330,ep154,"CHECK THIS OUT, BRIAN."
331,ep154,WOW! POOL IS HUGE!
332,ep154,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
333,ep154,DO YOU LOVE IT?
334,ep154,IT'S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
335,ep154,I COULD SEE THE KIDS PLAYING IN THE POOL 24 HOURS A DAY.
336,ep154,WE'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE OUR HOUSE.
337,ep154,THAT'S VERY NICE.
338,ep154,AND ALL THE ROOMS ARE ACCESSIBLE.
339,ep154,AND IT'S NICE ON THE BEDROOM.
340,ep154,I LIKE IT COMING OFF THE BEDROOM.
341,ep154,I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF WANTED THAT.
342,ep154,COME ON OVER...
343,ep154,LET ME SHOW YOU THE ORCHARD.
344,ep154,"(Suzanne) COMPLETE WITH FRUIT TREES, THIS HOUSE SEEMS TO BE A PERFECT MATCH FOR BRIAN AND MEG."
345,ep154,BRUCE LEAVES THEM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO INVEST THE EXTRA TIME AND MONEY IT'LL REQUIRE TO UPDATE IT TO THEIR STANDARDS.
346,ep154,"WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD GO THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, AND SEE IF THIS HOUSE HAS IT."
347,ep154,"I MEAN, IT'S GOT THE FOUR BEDROOMS."
348,ep154,IT'S GOT THE BIG KITCHEN.
349,ep154,"BIG KITCHEN, WHICH IS A MUST..."
350,ep154,IT'S A MUST.
351,ep154,"FOR YOU, ESPECIALLY."
352,ep154,"IT'S GOT THE ONE LEVEL, THE RANCH-STYLE."
353,ep154,I JUST THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND JUST...
354,ep154,"AND THE POOL, WHICH I REALLY WANTED, IS NICE."
355,ep154,"I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE SHOULD GO FOR IT AND..."
356,ep154,WANNA MAKE AN OFFER?
357,ep154,"MAKE AN OFFER, 'CAUSE I THINK IT'S GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED AND WANT."
358,ep154,"(Suzanne) READY TO GO FOR IT, BRIAN AND MEG RETURN WITH BRUCE TO HIS HOME OFFICE TO WRITE UP AN OFFER."
359,ep154,GUESS WHAT?
360,ep154,LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING AN OFFER ON A NEW HOUSE.
361,ep154,WOO-HOO! RIGHT!
362,ep154,"(Suzanne) MEG AND BRIAN HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A GREAT HOUSE, BUT WILL THEIR OFFER BE ACCEPTED?"
363,ep154,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
364,ep154,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
365,ep154,"AFTER LOOKING AT 16 HOMES, THE PUCCINELLIS HAVE FINALLY FOUND A HOUSE THAT HAS EVERYTHING THEY WANT."
366,ep154,"ALTHOUGH THE HOME NEEDS UPDATING, THEY DECIDED TO MAKE AN OFFER WITH PLANS OF REMODELING IF THEY GOT THE HOUSE."
367,ep154,"HELLO, THIS IS BRUCE."
368,ep154,"(Suzanne) A DAY AFTER THE OFFER IS MADE, REALTORS BRUCE AND ROXANNE ELLISON ARE RELAXING AT HOME WHEN THE SELLER'S AGENT CALLS."
369,ep154,THAT'LL BE FINE.
370,ep154,"(Suzanne) BRUCE CALLS BRIAN TO RELAY THE NEWS, AND BRIAN SHARES IT WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY."
371,ep154,"HI, GIRLS."
372,ep154,"HEY, HOW'D IT GO?"
373,ep154,"OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT."
374,ep154,JUST ALL RIGHT?
375,ep154,YOU DON'T LOOK VERY HAPPY.
376,ep154,"WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST TALKED TO BRUCE."
377,ep154,I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH HIM...
378,ep154,HE JUST CALLED.
379,ep154,NOT GOOD NEWS?
380,ep154,ITS GREAT NEWS.
381,ep154,GREAT NEWS?
382,ep154,"WE GOT A NEW HOUSE, YOU GUYS!"

386,ep154,"WE LIKE THE FLOW OF THE HOUSE, BUT ALL THE WOOD REALLY TOOK AWAY FROM IT."

415,ep154,"JUST THE STYLE, THE COLORS, THE DOORS..."
416,ep154,"(Meg) ACTUALLY, BETTER IN SOME ASPECTS."
417,ep154,"AND WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE AN OLDER HOUSE THAT WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT, TOTALLY NOT US, AND TRANSFORM IT INTO A PIECE OF US."
418,ep154,THAT WE'RE REALLY COMFORTABLE IN.
419,ep154,"YEAH, SO WE'RE PLEASED."
420,ep154,"WHEN THE PUCCINELLIS STARTED HOUSE HUNTING, THEY NEVER EXPECTED TO BUY A FIXER-UPPER, BUT THEY COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED THAT THEY DID."
421,ep154,NOW THEY'LL HAVE THIS HOUSE THAT REFLECTS THEIR STYLE PERFECTLY FOR YEARS TO COME.

3,ep156,NOLAND CHHUN IS LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME.
4,ep156,THE HOME MUST BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE SINGLE DAD AS WELL AS TWO SMALL CHILDREN WHO WILL VISIT OFTEN.
5,ep156,WILL NOLAND FIND EVERYTHING HE'S LOOKING FOR?
6,ep156,LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK.
7,ep156,WE'LL FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep156,♪♪ NOLAND CHHUN IS A MAN ON A HOUSE-HUNTING MISSION.
9,ep156,THIS BUSY COMPUTER EXECUTIVE SHARES CUSTODY OF HIS TWO CHILDREN WITH HIS EX-WIFE.
10,ep156,"BUT FOR THE LAST YEAR, HE HAS BEEN LIVING 60 MILES AWAY FROM THEM TO BE CLOSER TO HIS JOB."
11,ep156,"THE DISTANCE HAS BEEN TOUGH ON THE KIDS AND NOLAND, SO HE'S READY FOR A CHANGE."
12,ep156,MY KIDS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME.
13,ep156,"I WANT TO GIVE THEM THE SENSE OF SECURITY, THAT WHEN THEY GROW UP, THAT THEY HAVE TWO PARENTS THAT LOVE THEM LIKE A NORMAL FAMILY."
14,ep156,"AND THAT'S WHAT MY GOAL IS-- TO GIVE MY TWO KIDS THE SECURITY, THE NORM OF GROWING UP."
15,ep156,"AND IF THEY NEED DADDY, I'M NOT THREE HOURS AWAY FROM THEM."
16,ep156,YOU'RE CRAZY!
17,ep156,"I HAVE MY KIDS ONCE EVERY OTHER WEEKEND, SO USUALLY I PICK THEM UP FROM SCHOOL ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON, THEN DRIVE THEM HOME, AND THE TRAFFIC ON FRIDAY IS JUST..."
18,ep156,IT USUALLY TAKES ME ABOUT AROUND THREE HOURS.
19,ep156,"THEN WE SPEND THE WEEKEND TOGETHER, AND THEN ON MONDAY, WE HAVE TO GET UP EARLY AND THEN GO BACK AGAINST THE TRAFFIC, DROP 'EM OFF BACK AT SCHOOL ON MONDAY."
20,ep156,(Noland) WHAT'D YOU DO AT SCHOOL TODAY?
21,ep156,(Son) I LISTENED TO MY TEACHER.
22,ep156,(Son) I LISTENED TO MY TEACHER.
23,ep156,"WELL, THAT'S GOOD."
24,ep156,"WELL, THAT'S GOOD."
25,ep156,"WHAT REALLY HIT ME, ONE FRIDAY EVENING, FIGHTING THE TRAFFIC BACK BUMPER TO BUMPER, I LOOKED THROUGH THE REAR MIRROR."
26,ep156,"I SAW BOTH KIDS TIRED FROM SCHOOL, HUNGRY, AND THEY FELL ASLEEP."
27,ep156,"WHEN I SAW THEM FALL ASLEEP, TIRED, HAD NO DINNER YET, IT JUST HIT HOME HARD."
28,ep156,I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT OVER A YEAR.
29,ep156,IT'S JUST TOO HARD FOR THE KIDS.
30,ep156,AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT I'M LOOKING TO MOVE CLOSER TO THEM.
31,ep156,"(Suzanne) BUT HE ALSO NEEDS TO BE CLOSE TO WORK, SO NOLAND HAS TEMPORARILY RENTED AN APARTMENT THAT IS HALFWAY BETWEEN HIS WORK AND HIS KIDS."
32,ep156,HE'LL USE THIS TIME TO GET TO KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE HE WILL BE BUYING HIS HOME.
33,ep156,"HE'D LIKE TO MAKE THE MOVE QUICKLY, BECAUSE APARTMENT LIVING HAS BEEN A BIG CHANGE FOR NOLAND."
34,ep156,"(Noland) THE APARTMENT'S FLOOR SPACE IS A LITTLE BIT OVER 900 SQUARE FOOT, TWO BEDROOMS, TWO BATHS, AND IT HAS A LIVING ROOM-DINING AREA."
35,ep156,"BASICALLY, IT'S SMALL."
36,ep156,(Suzanne) NOLAND'S PRIMARY GOALS FOR HIS NEW HOME ARE CENTERED AROUND HIS CHILDREN.
37,ep156,(Noland) THE HOUSE SHOULD HAVE A MINIMUM FOUR BEDROOMS.
38,ep156,"EACH COULD HAVE THEIR OWN BEDROOM, MASTER BEDROOM AND ONE ROOM I'M GOING TO CONVERT INTO AN OFFICE."
39,ep156,"AN OFFICE IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AS WELL, BECAUSE ABOUT THREE DAYS OUT OF THE WEEK, I WORK OUT OF THE HOUSE."
40,ep156,"(Suzanne) NOLAND ALSO WANTS A BACKYARD AND A POOL WHERE HIS KIDS CAN PLAY, SOMETHING THIS SHORT-TERM APARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE."
41,ep156,(Noland) MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR NOW IS A SINGLE-STORY TYPE OF A HOUSE WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE KIDS JUMPING UP OFF THE STAIRS AND SO FORTH AND HAVE TO BLOCK THE STAIRWAY AT NIGHT.
42,ep156,"(Suzanne) NOLAND WANTS TO FIND A NEW HOME QUICKLY, SO HE CAN REPLACE HIS TEMPORARY APARTMENT WITH A STABLE HOME FOR HIS CHILDREN."
43,ep156,"(Noland) I CERTAINLY DON'T WANNA STAY IN THIS APARTMENT FOR SIX, SEVEN MONTHS FROM NOW AND STILL LOOKING FOR A HOUSE."
44,ep156,"I WILL HAVE TO COMPROMISE, IF I DON'T FIND THE EXACT HOUSE THAT I'M LOOKING FOR."

108,ep156,"OKAY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE BACKYARD IS VIRTUALLY ALL POOL AND HAS NO CHILDPROOF FENCE AROUND IT, WHICH WORRIES NOLAND."
109,ep156,THAT PLUS THE SMALL FAMILY ROOM AND LACK OF A FOURTH BEDROOM LEADS NOLAND TO CROSS THIS HOUSE OFF THE LIST.

513,ep156,NOLAND'S WAS ONE OF THREE OFFERS MADE ON THE HOUSE.
514,ep156,"SO TO GIVE HIS OFFER A PERSONAL TOUCH, NOLAND SENT ALONG A LETTER AND A PICTURE OF HIS KIDS."
515,ep156,TWO DAYS PASSED BEFORE THE SELLER'S AGENT CONTACTED NOLAND'S REALTOR CHRIS RUSSELL WITH THE NEWS OF WHETHER OR NOT HIS OFFER PREVAILED.
516,ep156,"HI... CHHUN, PLEASE."

528,ep156,(Suzanne) NO KIDDING.
529,ep156,"AFTER SEEING MORE THAN TWO DOZEN HOMES THAT HAD AN IMPERFECT LAYOUT OR WEREN'T CHILD FRIENDLY ENOUGH, NOLAND FINALLY STUMBLED ONTO A HOUSE THAT MET ALL OF HIS NEEDS AND CAPTURED HIS HEART AS WELL, JUST AS NOLAND'S LETTER WARMED THE HEART OF THE SELLER WHO HAPPILY ACCEPTED HIS OFFER."
530,ep156,"JUST FOUR WEEKS LATER, NOLAND'S ALL SETTLED IN."
531,ep156,"I'M VERY, VERY HAPPY..."
532,ep156,COULDN'T BE BETTER.
533,ep156,"IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME WAITING FOR THIS HOUSE, AND MY KIDS, OF COURSE, THEY LOVE IT."

535,ep156,"AND HANNAH, THE SAME WAY."
536,ep156,(Suzanne) AND WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?
537,ep156,THE KIDS' BEDROOMS ARE EVEN THE VERY SAME SIZE.
538,ep156,NO SIBLING RIVALRY IN THIS HOUSE!
539,ep156,BUT EVEN BETTER THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF IS ITS LOCATION-- FORTY-FIVE MILES CLOSER TO HIS CHILDREN.
540,ep156,"(Noland) WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP MY KIDS, IT TOOK ME ONLY 25 MINUTES, SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY..."
541,ep156,I'M TICKLED TO DEATH.
542,ep156,I FEEL LIKE I'M SO CLOSE TO THEM NOW.
543,ep156,IT'S WONDERFUL-- TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES VERSUS TWO HOURS.
544,ep156,"(Suzanne) WHEN YOU'RE AS DELIGHTED WITH A HOUSE AS NOLAND IS, IT'S HARD TO PICK A FAVORITE SPOT."
545,ep156,"NOLAND'S TWO KIDS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAD NO TROUBLE AT ALL."
546,ep156,"(Noland) WE FIND OURSELF, MOST OF THE WEEKEND THAT I HAVE THE KIDS, WE PLAY IN THE BACKYARD, AND THEN WE DON'T GO ANYPLACE ELSE."
547,ep156,"IT'S BIG, AND THEY HAVE THE POOL AND AN AREA FOR THEM TO PLAY AND SO FORTH, SO IT JUST..."
548,ep156,THIS HOUSE IS PHENOMENAL.
549,ep156,"I MEAN, EVERYTHING FROM THE INSIDE TO THE OUTSIDE IS JUST GREAT."
550,ep156,"THE KIDS, OF COURSE, LOVE THE POOL."
551,ep156,GOOD JOB!
552,ep156,"(Suzanne) SEEING NOLAND AND THE KIDS ENJOYING THEIR NEW HOME, IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT NOLAND'S HOUSE HUNT MIGHT HAVE ENDED DIFFERENTLY."
553,ep156,"BEFORE FINDING THIS HOUSE, HE'D PUT IN AN OFFER ON ANOTHER HOME."
554,ep156,SO DID THINGS WORK OUT FOR THE BEST?
555,ep156,"NOW, LOOKING BACK, THERE'S NO REGRET, ABSOLUTELY."
556,ep156,"I MEAN, ABSOLUTELY NO REGRET."
557,ep156,I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT HOUSE FOR ME.
558,ep156,I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION...
559,ep156,I JUST LOVE THIS HOUSE.

1,ep158,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep158,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep158,"SINCE GETTING MARRIED 11 YEARS AGO, MARK AND WENDY COHEN HAVE BEEN BUSY FULFILLING CHERISHED DREAMS LIKE RAISING A FAMILY."
4,ep158,"FOR MUCH OF THAT TIME THEY NEEDED THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY OF RENTING, BUT THEIR TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS ARE GROWING OLDER, AND THE FAMILY IS LOOKING TO PUT DOWN MORE PERMANENT ROOTS BY BUYING A HOUSE OF THEIR VERY OWN."
5,ep158,JOIN US AS WE FOLLOW WENDY AND MARK ON THEIR HUNT FOR THAT LONG-AWAITED HOUSE.
6,ep158,"♪♪ WHEN MARK AND WENDY COHEN MOVED INTO THIS THREE BEDROOM RENTAL HOUSE, IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE FOR LONG."
7,ep158,"(Mark) WE'VE BEEN RENTING HERE, LOOKING FOR A HOUSE, NEVER PLANNING ON STAYING HERE."
8,ep158,"OUR INTENTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO FIND A HOUSE TO MOVE INTO, TO RAISE A FAMILY IN."
9,ep158,"(Suzanne) THE FAMILY MOVED INTO THEIR RENTAL WHEN HANNAH, NOW SEVEN, WAS ONLY THREE, AND SADIE WASN'T EVEN BORN."
10,ep158,PART OF WHAT MAKES RENTING DIFFICULT FOR WENDY IS NOT HAVING THE FREEDOM TO DECORATE HER HOME THE WAY SHE'D LIKE.
11,ep158,"(Wendy) YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR OWN PERSONALITY INTO A HOME, AND PART OF RENTING IS NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT."
12,ep158,"SO MY BIGGEST MOTIVATION BEHIND FINDING A HOUSE IS EMOTIONAL, AND I TOTALLY WANTED SOMETHING THAT I COULD PUT DOWN ROOTS FOR MY CHILDREN, AND MEMORIES, AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT WERE OURS-- PERSONAL EXPRESSIONS OF OUR FAMILY."
13,ep158,"(Suzanne) THANKS TO A GENEROUS NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR, THE COHENS HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED ANOTHER THING THEY WANT."
14,ep158,WANNA GO SWIMMING?
15,ep158,WANNA GO SWIMMING?
16,ep158,YEAH! ONE OF OUR BIGGEST MEANS OF ENTERTAINMENT IS SWIMMING.
17,ep158,WE LOVE A POOL.
18,ep158,MY KIDS LOVE A POOL.
19,ep158,MY TWO-YEAR-OLD JUST LOVES TO LAY IN A POOL AND FLOAT.
20,ep158,SHE THINKS THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING.
21,ep158,"MY SEVEN-YEAR-OLD, SHE LOVES THE HIGH DIVE."
22,ep158,SHE SWIMS LIKE A FISH.
23,ep158,IT'S A FAMILY-ENTERTAINMENT SITUATION FOR US.
24,ep158,"SO TOP ON MY PRIORITY, AFTER ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES, IS THAT POOL..."
25,ep158,GOTTA HAVE A POOL.
26,ep158,(Suzanne) BUT THE COHENS KNOW THEY MUST ALSO BE PRACTICAL.
27,ep158,"(Mark) MY MAIN CRITERION IS THE YARD AND A RANCH-STYLE HOUSE IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU KNOW, KIND OF THE BRADY BUNCH STYLE- NEIGHBORHOOD TYPE THING."
28,ep158,"I GREW UP IN A TWO-STORY, BIG FARMHOUSE, AND WE WERE CONSTANTLY GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN."
29,ep158,"THEN WHEN I GAVE BIRTH TO OUR FIRST CHILD, WE LIVED IN A TWO-STORY HOUSE."
30,ep158,I MADE A VOW THEN...
31,ep158,I MADE A VOW THEN...
32,ep158,"IT WAS A TOWNHOUSE IT WAS A TOWNHOUSE THAT WAS KINDA NARROW, AND IT HAD..."
33,ep158,I MADE A VOW THAT I DID NOT WANT STAIRS IN MY HOUSE.
34,ep158,(Suzanne) THE COHENS DO IN FACT LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THEIR CURRENT HOME.
35,ep158,"THE BEDROOMS ARE GOOD-SIZED, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, ON ONE FLOOR."
36,ep158,"THE KITCHEN, THOUGH SMALL, HAS ENOUGH ROOM FOR AN EATING AREA."
37,ep158,THIS IS ONE THING THAT BOTH MARK AND WENDY WOULD LIKE TO FIND IN A NEW HOUSE.
38,ep158,BUT THEIR MUST-HAVE LISTS ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME.
39,ep158,AND MARK AND WENDY ARE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING THE KIND OF HOUSE THEY WANT FOR THEIR FAMILY.
40,ep158,(Wendy) WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOUR YEARS...
41,ep158,WE DIDN'T PLAN TO BE HERE THAT LONG IN THIS HOUSE.
42,ep158,"DADDY, DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?"
43,ep158,"(Suzanne) ADDING TO THEIR HOUSE HUNTING DILEMMA IS THE FACT THAT MARK'S JOB AS AN AIRLINE PILOT KEEPS HIM OUT OF TOWN FOR MUCH OF THE TIME, LEAVING WENDY TO DO MOST OF THE LOOKING."
44,ep158,I'VE LOOKED AT LOTS OF HOMES.
45,ep158,"AND I'M THINKING OVER THE FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE LOOKED, MAYBE TEN OF THEM I REALLY WANTED TO BE IN..."
46,ep158,OVER FOUR YEARS.
47,ep158,OVER FOUR YEARS.
48,ep158,YEAH. RIDE...
49,ep158,SADIE RIDE.
50,ep158,SADIE WANTS TO RIDE...
51,ep158,OKAY... ON.
52,ep158,"(Suzanne) AND EVEN IF WENDY THOUGHT A HOUSE WOULD WORK FOR HER, SHE STILL HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET MARK TO SEE IT."
53,ep158,"(Wendy) HE WOULD BE IN TOWN, YOU KNOW, THREE DAYS OUT OF A WEEK, AND THEN WE HAD TO DO ALL OF OUR NORMAL FAMILY THINGS PLUS FIND SOME TIME TO LOOK AT SOME HOUSES WHILE HE WAS THERE."
54,ep158,"AND I WOULD GO THROUGH THINKING HE'LL LOVE THIS HOUSE, HE'LL LOVE THIS HOUSE, AND NO..."
55,ep158,HE WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.
56,ep158,(Suzanne) ANOTHER PROBLEM THE COUPLE FACES IS THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN A NEW HOME.
57,ep158,HE ALWAYS ASKS ME...
58,ep158,IS THERE COPPER PLUMBING?
59,ep158,IS THERE COPPER PLUMBING?
60,ep158,"YEAH, YEAH, JUST THE QUALITY OF THE HOUSE, HOW WAS IT BUILT..."
61,ep158,"IT COULD BE OLD, BUT IF IT WAS BUILT WELL, THAT'S FINE."
62,ep158,(Suzanne) MARK UNDERSTANDS THAT HIS BEING AWAY MAKES WENDY'S SEARCH FOR A HOUSE DIFFICULT.
63,ep158,HE'S COUNTING ON A REAL ESTATE AGENT TO GIVE WENDY THE HELP SHE NEEDS.
64,ep158,IT'S A LOT OF WORK...
65,ep158,"WE'VE GOT TWO KIDS, AND WITH ME NOT BEING HOME AS MUCH AS I AM, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR WENDY TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR A HOUSE."
66,ep158,IT'S DIFFICULT FOR WENDY TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR A HOUSE.
67,ep158,THAT'S RIGHT.
68,ep158,THAT'S RIGHT.
69,ep158,"THE KEY IS FINDING A REALTOR THAT WILL DO THAT RESEARCH FOR YOU, PROVIDE YOU WITH WHAT IT IS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."
70,ep158,(Suzanne) IT HAS TAKEN THE COHENS SOME TIME TO FIND THAT REALTOR.
71,ep158,WENDY MET JERI BENSON IN A DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM THREE YEARS INTO THEIR HOUSE HUNT.
72,ep158,JERI HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE COHENS FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW AND KNOWS THE GAME PLAN.
73,ep158,"(Wendy) I WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT, AFTER BEING THROUGH SO MANY REALTORS, THAT SHE WOULD BE DETAILED ENOUGH FOR ME, AND LONG-SUFFERING AND PATIENT, AND..."
74,ep158,SHE'S BEEN EVERYTHING.
75,ep158,"THOSE ARE IMPORTANT QUALITIES IN A REALTOR, I BELIEVE, REALLY IMPORTANT QUALITIES."
76,ep158,WHEN YOU WORK WITH A COUPLE ESPECIALLY.
77,ep158,"MY HUSBAND LOOKS FOR TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS IN A HOUSE THAN I DO, AND A GOOD REALTOR HAS GOTTA REALLY HONE IN ON WHAT YOU BOTH WANT AND THEN BRING THEM TOGETHER."
78,ep158,"MY FIRST PRIORITY IS FINDING A HOUSE THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOVE, AND THEIR HEARTS ARE GONNA SAY OH, MY GOSH, THIS IS WHERE WE WANNA BE, WHERE WE WANNA RAISE OUR FAMILY."
79,ep158,IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES.
80,ep158,I'M GONNA FIND THEM THEIR HOUSE.
81,ep158,IT'S OUT THERE.
82,ep158,"(Suzanne) AFTER SEEING OVER 100 HOUSES, HAS THE TIME COME FOR THE COHENS TO FIND THAT RIGHT ONE?"
83,ep158,OR WILL IT TAKE ANOTHER HUNDRED BEFORE THE PERFECT HOME COMES ALONG?
84,ep158,STAY TUNED.
85,ep158,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
86,ep158,WENDY AND MARK COHEN WERE HOPING TO BUY A NEW HOME SOON AFTER THEY MOVED INTO THEIR CURRENT RENTAL.
87,ep158,"NOW FOUR YEARS LATER THE COHENS ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A NICE HOUSE IN A SUBURBAN, FAMILY-ORIENTED NEIGHBORHOOD."
88,ep158,(Suzanne) WENDY FIGURES SHE'S LOOKED AT OVER A HUNDRED HOMES SO FAR.
89,ep158,"SHE'S DONE MOST OF THAT LOOKING ON HER OWN, BECAUSE MARK'S JOB AS A PILOT KEEPS HIM OUT OF TOWN FOR DAYS AT A TIME."
90,ep158,"NOW THAT THE FAMILY IS WORKING WITH REALTOR JERI BENSON, THEY'RE HOPING THAT THINGS WILL TURN AROUND."
91,ep158,JERI ISN'T SURE THAT SHE CAN FIND A HOUSE THAT WILL PLEASE THE COHENS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING.
92,ep158,BUT SHE AND WENDY WANT TO EXHAUST ALL THEIR OPTIONS BEFORE WIDENING THEIR SEARCH.
93,ep158,"WENDY, THIS IS THE AREA THAT YOU AND MARK REALLY HAVE WANTED, AND HOPEFULLY, REALLY HAVE WANTED, AND HOPEFULLY, DOESN'T LOOK GOOD."
94,ep158,DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
95,ep158,THIS HOUSE WILL FIT THE BILL.
96,ep158,"IT'S SO HARD TO FIND THAT PERFECT HOUSE, I KNOW."
97,ep158,HMM... LONG HAS IT BEEN ON THE MARKET?
98,ep158,"OH, A COUPLE OF MONTHS."
99,ep158,"OH, A COUPLE OF MONTHS."
100,ep158,THE DOOR IS OPEN.
101,ep158,THE DOOR IS OPEN.
102,ep158,FROM THE OPEN HOUSE THEY WERE HOLDING TODAY.
103,ep158,"OH, MY."
104,ep158,THEY HAVE BERBER CARPETING...
105,ep158,NICE FIREPLACE.
106,ep158,OH... WON'T LIKE THIS.
107,ep158,HE WILL NOT GO FOR THIS.
108,ep158,"I'M NOT REAL HAPPY MYSELF, ACTUALLY."
109,ep158,I JUST WANTED YOU TO SEE EVERYTHING IN THE AREA.
110,ep158,THIS WILL NOT WORK...
111,ep158,THIS ISN'T FOR US.
112,ep158,"(Suzanne) DESPITE WENDY'S RESERVATIONS, SHE DECIDES TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHAT THE REST OF THE HOUSE HAS TO OFFER."
113,ep158,"THE FAMILY ROOM IS GOOD- SIZED, BUT LACKS THE STYLE THAT WENDY IS LOOKING FOR."
114,ep158,THE COHENS WOULD LIKE TO FIND A HOME THEY COULD MOVE RIGHT INTO WITHOUT HAVING TO RENOVATE.
115,ep158,"WELL, WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LOOK."
116,ep158,WAY TOO MUCH TO WORK ON.
117,ep158,WANNA TAKE A LOOK IN THE YARD?
118,ep158,YEAH... LOOK AT THE YARD.
119,ep158,HEY... AT THE YARD.
120,ep158,LET'S SEE HOW THIS LOOKS.
121,ep158,THIS IS NOT GONNA BE GOOD FOR MY KIDS.
122,ep158,IS THERE A ROOM FOR A POOL?
123,ep158,IS THERE A ROOM FOR A POOL?
124,ep158,"NO, PRETTY SMALL YARD."
125,ep158,"NO, PRETTY SMALL YARD."
126,ep158,(Suzanne) THE HOME'S YARD ALSO DOES NOT IMPRESS THIS VETERAN HOUSE HUNTER.
127,ep158,"WITH NO ROOM TO INSTALL A POOL, THE HOME FALLS OFF WENDY'S LIST."
128,ep158,LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ONE.
129,ep158,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH THE KITCHEN HAS NEW APPLIANCES WENDY LIKES, IT'S TOO SMALL FOR THE FAMILY'S NEEDS."
130,ep158,THIS IS NOT FOR US.
131,ep158,THIS IS NOT FOR US.
132,ep158,I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.
133,ep158,I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.
134,ep158,"(Suzanne) EVEN WENDY, DIE-HARD HOUSE HUNTER THAT SHE IS, CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL FRUSTRATED AT THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING JUST THE RIGHT HOME."
135,ep158,"WELL, WE TRIED."
136,ep158,YEAH... A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.
137,ep158,"I LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT NO, NOT THIS HOUSE."
138,ep158,"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY IS THAT JUST MEANS 'CAUSE THIS WASN'T THE HOUSE, IT'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER, AND WE'LL FIND IT!"
139,ep158,"IT'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER, AND WE'LL FIND IT!"
140,ep158,OKAY. IS REALLY CUTE.
141,ep158,THIS IS REALLY CUTE.
142,ep158,IT LOOKS NICE FROM THE STREET.
143,ep158,IT LOOKS NICE FROM THE STREET.
144,ep158,I LIKE THE PLANTS.
145,ep158,I LIKE THE PLANTS.
146,ep158,I LIKE THE BRICKS...
147,ep158,THEY'RE SO NICE.
148,ep158,I LIKE THE BRICKS...
149,ep158,THEY'RE SO NICE.
150,ep158,BUT THAT FREEWAY IS WAY TOO NOISY.
151,ep158,"YEAH, I CAN HEAR THAT."
152,ep158,"YEAH, I CAN HEAR THAT."
153,ep158,I LIKE THE TREES.
154,ep158,I LIKE THE TREES.
155,ep158,LET'S GO IN AND JUST LOOK.
156,ep158,LET'S GO IN AND JUST LOOK.
157,ep158,"OKAY. AT HOW LIGHT AND BRIGHT, WENDY."
158,ep158,"LOOK AT HOW LIGHT AND BRIGHT, WENDY."
159,ep158,WOW! LEAST IT'S CLEAN.
160,ep158,NEW CARPETS.
161,ep158,"YEAH, NEW CARPET..."
162,ep158,"NICE WHITE PAINT, NEW PAINT."
163,ep158,CENTRAL AIR AND HEAT.
164,ep158,WINDOW TREATMENTS ARE NICE.
165,ep158,OKAY... LOOK AROUND.
166,ep158,"OKAY, THE KITCHEN..."
167,ep158,"KITCHEN, KITCHEN."
168,ep158,KIND OF A SMALL KITCHEN.
169,ep158,KIND OF A SMALL KITCHEN.
170,ep158,WASN'T MARK SAYING WASN'T MARK SAYING HE WANTED A LARGE EATING AREA?
171,ep158,HE WANTED A LARGE EATING AREA?
172,ep158,"YEAH, MARK WANTS A BIG KITCHEN-- YEAH, MARK WANTS A BIG KITCHEN-- MAYBE A KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM, OR KITCHEN/FAMILY ROOM COMBINED."
173,ep158,THERE'S NO DISHWASHER.
174,ep158,THERE'S NO DISHWASHER.
175,ep158,LOOK AT IT...
176,ep158,LOOK AT IT...
177,ep158,THEY'VE GOT A TRASH COMPACTOR.
178,ep158,LOOK AT THIS...
179,ep158,"LOOK HOW CUTE THIS IS, WENDY."
180,ep158,THAT I LIKE...
181,ep158,BUILT IN...
182,ep158,TOASTER OVEN.
183,ep158,OKAY... LOOK AT THE REST.
184,ep158,WE'VE GOT A BATHROOM HERE.
185,ep158,IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALL.
186,ep158,IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALL.
187,ep158,IT'S GOT NICE LIGHTING.
188,ep158,IT'S GOT NICE LIGHTING.
189,ep158,I WONDER IF THIS IS THE MASTER BATH.
190,ep158,IS THIS THE MASTER BATH?
191,ep158,IS THIS THE MASTER BATH?
192,ep158,IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
193,ep158,IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
194,ep158,THIS LOOKS LIKE THE MASTER BEDROOM.
195,ep158,LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
196,ep158,THIS IS VERY SMALL FOR A MASTER BEDROOM.
197,ep158,BUT LOOK...
198,ep158,IT GOES OUT TO THE POOL!
199,ep158,"AT LEAST THERE'S A POOL, THAT'S A GOOD THING."
200,ep158,YEA... HOUSE WITH A POOL FOR YOU!
201,ep158,"(Suzanne) WENDY HAS NO TROUBLE FINDING HOMES WITH SOME, OR EVEN MOST OF THE ITEMS ON THEIR WISH LIST."
202,ep158,THE PROBLEM IS FINDING A HOUSE THAT HAS EVERYTHING.
203,ep158,THE GIRLS WOULD LOVE THIS POOL.
204,ep158,IT'S CLEAN.
205,ep158,IT'S CLEAN.
206,ep158,"IT'S CLEAN, BUT.."
207,ep158,"IT'S CLEAN, BUT.."
208,ep158,YOU STILL HEAR THAT FREEWAY NOISE.
209,ep158,YOU STILL HEAR THAT FREEWAY NOISE.
210,ep158,YEAH... WOULD BE ANNOYING YEAH...
211,ep158,THAT WOULD BE ANNOYING SITTING OUT HERE.
212,ep158,I'M NOT SURE THIS'LL REALLY WORK.
213,ep158,"GREAT POOL, THOUGH."
214,ep158,"GREAT POOL, THOUGH."
215,ep158,YEAH... PRETTY.
216,ep158,YEAH... PRETTY.
217,ep158,"WELL, ONWARD TO THE NEXT!"
218,ep158,"(Suzanne) POOL OR NO POOL, THIS HOUSE JUST ISN'T THE ONE."
219,ep158,WENDY AND JERI HAVE SPENT QUITE SOME TIME LOOKING WITH LITTLE TO SHOW FOR IT.
220,ep158,"WENDY HAS BEEN ADAMANT ABOUT FINDING A HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT WITH NO ACCEPTABLE FINDS AND THE NUMBER OF HOUSES ON THE MARKET DWINDLING, JERI MUST HELP HER FACE FACTS."
221,ep158,LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
222,ep158,"I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE THIS AREA, AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN REALLY LOOKING HERE, BUT THINGS JUST SEEM NOT TO CONNECT."
223,ep158,WOULD IT BE OKAY IF WE EXPANDED AND WENT TO MAYBE SOME MORE SURROUNDING AREAS?
224,ep158,BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT YOU COULD FIND A LOT MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN DIFFERENT AREAS.
225,ep158,OKAY... WE DO THAT SOON?
226,ep158,OKAY... WE DO THAT SOON?
227,ep158,"ABSOLUTELY. JERI FOUND SOME PROMISING LISTINGS, AND ON THEIR NEXT OUTING, THE WOMEN SNUCK A PEEK AT A HOUSE THAT HAD JUST COME ON THE MARKET."
228,ep158,"(Jeri) WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
229,ep158,"(Jeri) WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
230,ep158,I REALLY LIKE IT.
231,ep158,I REALLY LIKE IT.
232,ep158,I THINK THIS HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL.
233,ep158,"IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD ALL THE AMENITIES THAT YOU AND MARK HAD TALKED ABOUT, AND WE OBVIOUSLY HADN'T SEEN BEFORE."
234,ep158,"(Suzanne) WENDY LOVES THE HOUSE, BUT WHAT ABOUT MARK?"
235,ep158,"HE'S NOT GOING TO BE BACK IN TOWN FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AND EVEN THEN HE DOESN'T ALWAYS LIKE THE SAME THINGS WENDY DOES."
236,ep158,WILL MARK LIKE THE HOUSE THAT WENDY LOVES?
237,ep158,"(Jeri) SO MARK, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
238,ep158,(Suzanne) FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
239,ep158,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
240,ep158,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
241,ep158,"MARK AND WENDY COHEN HAVE THEIR HEART SET ON BUYING A HOME IN A CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LOVE, AND THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING..."
242,ep158,"FOUR YEARS, IN FACT, AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND A SUITABLE HOUSE IN THEIR PRICE RANGE."
243,ep158,"(Suzanne) SO THEIR REALTOR, JERI BENSON, HAS SUGGESTED LOOKING IN OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS."
244,ep158,"SINCE THE COHENS HAVE BROADENED THEIR HORIZONS, THINGS ARE STARTING TO LOOK UP."
245,ep158,"IN FACT, ONE HOUSE SEEMS SO PROMISING THAT WENDY AND JERI HAVE BROUGHT MARK TO GET HIS OPINION."
246,ep158,TWO-YEAR-OLD SADIE HAS ALSO JOINED THE TOUR.
247,ep158,COME ON IN...
248,ep158,"WE'RE SO EXCITED, MARK, FOR YOU TO SEE THE HOUSE."
249,ep158,THIS HAS EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT.
250,ep158,"COME ON IN, LET'S GO IN HERE."
251,ep158,IT'S GOT THE GREAT FIREPLACE THAT YOU HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
252,ep158,"AND WENDY HAD POINTED OUT THAT YOU REALLY WANTED BEAM CEILINGS THAT WALK OUT TO A VERANDA, SO IT'S GREAT."
253,ep158,(Mark) I LIKE THE CEILING...
254,ep158,IT'S NICE.
255,ep158,"'CAUSE IT REALLY IS LIGHT, BRIGHT, AND WITH THE HIGHER CEILINGS, IT LOOKS BIGGER THAN IT IS."
256,ep158,"YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DINING ROOM HERE, AND IT WALKS RIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN."
257,ep158,I KNOW THAT IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE THAT YOU HAD A BUILT-IN AREA FOR THE KIDS FOR BREAKFAST...
258,ep158,AND WATCH TV.
259,ep158,(Wendy) LOTS OF CABINETS.
260,ep158,"MARK, A WONDERFUL FEATURE OF THIS HOUSE IS THAT THEIR CABINETRY HAS PULL-OUTS, IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE POTS AND PANS..."
261,ep158,THE STORAGE...
262,ep158,IT'S WONDERFUL.
263,ep158,THAT IS NICE...
264,ep158,A LOT OF CABINET SPACE.
265,ep158,THAT IS NICE...
266,ep158,A LOT OF CABINET SPACE.
267,ep158,"ABSOLUTELY. A LOT OF BUILT-INS, FROM YOUR MICROWAVE TO YOUR OVEN."
268,ep158,FROM YOUR MICROWAVE TO YOUR OVEN.
269,ep158,I KNOW...
270,ep158,MAGIC CHEF.
271,ep158,I KNOW...

281,ep158,"(Sadie) SADIE'S BATHROOM, MAMA."
282,ep158,THE BATHROOM...

284,ep158,I LIKE THE BATHROOM BETWEEN BOTH BEDROOMS.
285,ep158,"OH, LOOK AT THIS BIG MURAL."
286,ep158,"OH, LOOK AT THIS BIG MURAL."

300,ep158,FOR THE OFFICE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?
301,ep158,"YEAH... COULD BE AN OFFICE, YEAH..."
302,ep158,"THIS COULD BE AN OFFICE, OR A GUEST ROOM."
303,ep158,AND REALLY LIGHT AND BRIGHT.
304,ep158,"YEAH, I LIKE THE TWO WINDOWS."
305,ep158,"YEAH, I LIKE THE TWO WINDOWS."
306,ep158,NICE WINDOW TREATMENT.

310,ep158,"SO MARK, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
311,ep158,I LIKE IT.

313,ep158,THE HOUSE HAS A LOT OF ROOM...
314,ep158,THIS IS A GOOD-SIZE ROOM TOO.
315,ep158,"WHAT'S WONDERFUL IS THE CLOSET SPACE IN THIS MASTER BEDROOM-- TWO-SIDED, OPENS WIDE."
316,ep158,IT'S GOT THE SHELVES.
317,ep158,IT'S GOT THE SHELVES.
318,ep158,THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN THIS ROOM.
319,ep158,THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN THIS ROOM.
320,ep158,IT'S A PRETTY AREA-- GOOD CROSS BREEZE.
321,ep158,YEAH... LIKE IT.
322,ep158,YEAH... LIKE IT.
323,ep158,"ABSOLUTELY. LEADS OUT TO THE VERANDA, WHICH IS A REALLY NICE FEATURE."
324,ep158,OUT THIS WAY.
325,ep158,"(Suzanne) SO FAR SO GOOD, BUT THE COHENS HAVE STRESSED ALL ALONG HOW MUCH THEY WANT A NICE YARD FOR THE GIRLS TO PLAY IN, PREFERABLY ONE WITH A POOL."
326,ep158,"WELL, THIS IS THE BACKYARD I WAS TALKING ABOUT..."
327,ep158,THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE HOUSE.
328,ep158,"OVER ALMOST 18,000 FLAT WITH..."
329,ep158,LOOK AT ALL THE FRUIT TREES!
330,ep158,WITH... AT ALL THE FRUIT TREES!
331,ep158,I LIKE IT.
332,ep158,I LIKE IT.
333,ep158,ORANGES... THE HERB GARDEN.
334,ep158,ROOM FOR THE POOL!
335,ep158,PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A POOL.
336,ep158,I LIKE ALL THE TREES.
337,ep158,"SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HONEY?"
338,ep158,"SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, HONEY?"
339,ep158,IT'S A NICE HOUSE...
340,ep158,I LIKE IT.
341,ep158,IT'S A NICE HOUSE...
342,ep158,I LIKE IT.
343,ep158,I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE AN OFFER ON IT.
344,ep158,"YOU DO...OH,"
345,ep158,HONEY! DID IT!
346,ep158,"THANK YOU, JERI."
347,ep158,"THANK YOU, JERI."
348,ep158,CONGRATULATIONS! GO WRITE THE OFFER!
349,ep158,LET'S GO WRITE THE OFFER!
350,ep158,OKAY... DO IT!
351,ep158,OKAY... DO IT!
352,ep158,AFTER YOU!
353,ep158,"COME ON, SADIE, LET'S GO."
354,ep158,"(Wendy) HONEY, THIS COULD BE OUR NEW HOUSE."
355,ep158,(Suzanne) IS WENDY RIGHT?
356,ep158,"NOW THAT THEY HAVE FINALLY FOUND A HOUSE THAT SUITS THEM, WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GET IT?"
357,ep158,"FIND OUT, WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS."
358,ep158,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
359,ep158,"AFTER FOUR YEARS OF LOOKING, WENDY AND MARK COHEN FINALLY FOUND A HOUSE THEY COULD GET EXCITED ABOUT."
360,ep158,"IT HAS THE WARMTH AND CHARM THAT WENDY'S BEEN LOOKING FOR, AND IT EVEN HAS MARK'S COPPER PLUMBING."
361,ep158,(Suzanne) SO THEY PUT IN AN OFFER ON THIS RANCH-STYLE HOME AND WAITED WITH BAITED BREATH.
362,ep158,"HAPPILY, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR LONG."
363,ep158,(ring) HELLO.
364,ep158,"HELLO, JERI."
365,ep158,SO YOU HAVE TO BUY US A HOUSEWARMING PRESENT?
366,ep158,THAT MUST MEAN WE GOT THE HOUSE.
367,ep158,WE HAVE A HOUSE!
368,ep158,WE HAVE A HOUSE!
369,ep158,"GREAT! HAVE THE HOUSE, GIRLS!"
370,ep158,"YES! SO AFTER YEARS OF LOOKING, THINGS NOW BEGIN TO MOVE AT WHAT SEEMS LIKE WARP SPEED FOR THE COHENS."
371,ep158,"IN FACT, THEY WERE IN THEIR NEW HOME LESS THAN SIX WEEKS LATER."
372,ep158,(Wendy) I LOVE OUR HOUSE.
373,ep158,"ACTUALLY, IT'S HOME HOME TO ME NOW."
374,ep158,IT'S MY FIRST REAL HOME FOR MY CHILDREN.
375,ep158,I CAN LIVE HERE AND RETIRE HERE AND RAISE MY CHILDREN HERE.
376,ep158,SO I'M VERY HAPPY AND CONTENT IN THAT VAIN.
377,ep158,"ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FOUR YEARS IT TOOK TO GET HERE, I WAS NEARLY AT THE END OF MY ROPE."
378,ep158,I WAS NEARLY AT THE END OF MY ROPE.
379,ep158,"YEAH. AS DIFFICULT AND FRUSTRATING AS THEIR SEARCH WAS, THE HOUSE THEY FINALLY FOUND HAS MANY OF THE FEATURES BOTH WENDY AND MARK WANTED FROM THE BEGINNING."
380,ep158,(Mark) IT'S A RANCH...
381,ep158,"WE WANTED A RANCH-STYLE HOUSE, SO THERE'S NO STAIRS TO CLIMB."
382,ep158,(Wendy) WE HAVE AN UPGRADED KITCHEN.
383,ep158,WE WERE LOOKING AT HOUSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE WANTED TO BE IN WHERE THE KITCHENS WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE COMPLETELY REMODELED.
384,ep158,(Suzanne) THE WHOLE FAMILY IS SETTLING IN NICELY.
385,ep158,"WITH SO MUCH ADDITIONAL ROOM, EVERYONE HAS A SPACE OF THEIR OWN."
386,ep158,(Wendy) MY FAVORITE ROOM IS WHAT WAS CALLED THE VERANDA.
387,ep158,THE KIDS SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME THERE WHEN THEY'RE HOME.
388,ep158,I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME THERE WHEN I'M WORKING.
389,ep158,(Mark) WE ENDED UP WITH A GUEST ROOM-- A REAL NICE GUEST ROOM.
390,ep158,WE WERE ABLE TO PUT ONE OF OUR EXTRA KING-SIZE BEDS IN IT.
391,ep158,"(Wendy) SO ACTUALLY, TO HAVE THIS FOURTH BEDROOM FOR US IS A VERY NICE THING."
392,ep158,"WHEN WE DON'T HAVE GUESTS, IT'S HIS OFFICE."
393,ep158,"(Suzanne) BUT AS MARK POINTED OUT WHEN HE FIRST SAW THE HOUSE, THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS THE BACKYARD."
394,ep158,"HANNAH, YOU WANT TO PLAY SOME FRISBEE?"
395,ep158,"(Suzanne) EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A POOL YET, THE COHENS HAVE FOUND PLENTY OF WAYS TO ENJOY THEIR CONSIDERABLE LAWN AND GENEROUS PATIO."
396,ep158,WANNA BUY SOME ORANGES?
397,ep158,YEAH...I BUY ORANGES.
398,ep158,(Mark) GOOD CATCH...
399,ep158,ALL RIGHT!
400,ep158,GOOD THROW...
401,ep158,YOU'RE GETTIN' BETTER!
402,ep158,THERE YA GO.
403,ep158,SO WHERE DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD PUT THE POOL OUT HERE?
404,ep158,I THINK JUST RIGHT AROUND HERE.
405,ep158,YOU LIKE IT HERE...
406,ep158,YOU LIKE IT HERE...
407,ep158,YEAH. OVER THERE?
408,ep158,YEAH. OVER THERE?
409,ep158,NOT OVER THERE?
410,ep158,NOT OVER THERE...
411,ep158,IT'S WAY TOO MUCH GOOD GRASS.
412,ep158,NOT OVER THERE...
413,ep158,IT'S WAY TOO MUCH GOOD GRASS.
414,ep158,"OH. LIKE THIS SPOT, BECAUSE IF WE CUT THESE TREES BACK, ALL THE LEAVES WON'T FALL IN THE POOL."
415,ep158,"YEAH, AND IF YOU MAKE A TREE HOUSE OVER THERE, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUMP IN THE POOL FROM THE TREE HOUSE."
416,ep158,JUMP IN THE POOL FROM THE TREE HOUSE?
417,ep158,JUMP IN THE POOL FROM THE TREE HOUSE?
418,ep158,MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
419,ep158,"(Suzanne) BUT MARK, WENDY, AND THE GIRLS DO KNOW THAT EVEN WITHOUT A POOL OR A TREE HOUSE, THEY'RE HOME AND THEIR FAMILY COULD NOT BE A BETTER MATCH."
420,ep158,WE'VE GOT JUST WHAT WE WANTED...
421,ep158,I THINK WE GOT AN EXCELLENT DEAL.
422,ep158,"I MEAN, THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO US, BUT LIKE I SAID, I MEAN, THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO US, BUT LIKE I SAID, HE GOT THE DEAL."
423,ep158,HE GOT THE DEAL.
424,ep158,"THE SEARCH WAS SO LONG, AND WE WERE LOOKIN' FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF THING."
425,ep158,"WE DIDN'T FIND IT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE WERE LOOKIN' FOR, BUT WE FOUND IT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT SURPRISED US TO BE THE SAME TYPE OF THING WE WERE LOOKIN' FOR, TO BE THE SAME TYPE OF THING WE WERE LOOKIN' FOR, RIGHT."
426,ep158,RIGHT. WE ENDED UP GETTING A GREAT DEAL ON TOP OF IT.
427,ep158,IT WORKED OUT THAT WAY.
428,ep158,THINGS KIND OF FELL IN PLACE.
429,ep158,"FOUR YEARS AFTER THEY STARTED HOUSE HUNTING, MARK, WENDY, HANNAH, AND LITTLE SADIE HAVE, OR WILL SOON HAVE, ALL THEY EVER WANTED IN A NEW HOME."
430,ep158,I'M SUZANNE WHANG...
431,ep158,THANKS FOR WATCHING.
432,ep158,"Captioning provided by Scripps Networks, Inc."
433,ep158,"Captioned by Closed Captioning Services Inc, Grand Rapids, MI."
434,ep158,♪♪
1,ep159,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep159,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep159,HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS SCOTT MAXSON AND MARY CALLUZA ARE ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED.
4,ep159,"THEY EACH CURRENTLY OWN THEIR OWN HOME, BUT WITH THEIR WEDDING DAY JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY, THEIR LIFESTYLES ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE."
5,ep159,"IN FACT, THEIR FIRST MOVE TOGETHER AS HUSBAND AND WIFE WILL BE TO BUY A NEW HOUSE..."
6,ep159,WOW! TUNED AND WATCH THESE TEACHERS LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF HOME BUYING.
7,ep159,"♪♪ SCOTT MAXSON, HIS FIANCéE MARY CALLUZA AND HER DAUGHTER KORIN ARE ABOUT TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES."
8,ep159,"NOT ONLY ARE SCOTT AND MARY ABOUT TO WALK DOWN THE AISLE TOGETHER, BUT THEY WILL ALSO BE TAKING THEIR FIRST BIG STEP AS A MARRIED COUPLE-- BUYING A HOUSE."
9,ep159,"WE WANNA SELL BOTH OF OUR PLACES AND BUY A BIGGER HOUSE THAT'LL BE NICER, BIGGER, A PLACE WHERE KORIN CAN HAVE A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE, AND WE CAN ENJOY THAT BIGGER, NICER SPACE."
10,ep159,"WHERE I'VE BEEN LIVING IS A ONE-BEDROOM HOUSE, WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT RARE, BUT I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD IT."
11,ep159,THE HOUSE HAS SOME PROBLEMS...
12,ep159,IT'S AN OLD HOUSE.
13,ep159,A LOT OF THE OLDER HOUSES...
14,ep159,OLD- FASHIONED DOORWAYS.
15,ep159,"I'M SIX, FIVE..."
16,ep159,"WITH MY SHOES ON, I'M SIX, SIX."
17,ep159,"THE DOORWAYS ARE SOMETIMES ONLY ABOUT SIX, THREE OR FOUR."
18,ep159,THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS...
19,ep159,I'M ON THE EDGE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE IT'S NOT AS SAFE.
20,ep159,THE AIR DOESN'T FEEL GREAT FOR A FAMILY.
21,ep159,(Suzanne) THE FEATURE THAT SCOTT ENJOYS MOST ABOUT HIS HOUSE IS THE LARGE GARAGE THAT IS ATTACHED TO HIS LIVING ROOM.
22,ep159,"SCOTT, WHO IS A MUSIC TEACHER, CONVERTED THE ENTIRE SPACE INTO A COMPLETE MUSIC STUDIO WHERE HE SPENDS MUCH OF HIS TIME REHEARSING AND RECORDING ORIGINAL SONGS."
23,ep159,♪♪ AN ADDED BONUS IS THAT SCOTT DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DISTURBING ANY NEIGHBORS.
24,ep159,WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE CURRENT HOUSE I'M IN IS THAT THERE'S NOT TOO MANY NEIGHBORS AROUND IT OR NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE LIVING CLOSE TO THE MUSIC STUDIO PART OF THE HOUSE.
25,ep159,"ONE THING I HATE ARE HIGH-DENSITY NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE MANY NEIGHBORS CAN HEAR THE MUSIC I PLAY, THE DRUMS, THE MARIMBA, THE VIBES AND THE ELECTRONIC MUSIC KEYBOARDS."
26,ep159,"I'VE BEEN USED TO HAVING A GARAGE I CONVERTED TO A MUSIC KIND OF RECORDING, REHEARSAL TYPE ROOM."
27,ep159,AND WE HOPE TO FIND A PLACE THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT AND HAVE A GARAGE WHERE I CAN DO THAT.
28,ep159,"(Suzanne) WHILE SCOTT'S HOUSE WAS SUITABLE FOR ONE PERSON, IT'S NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION FOR A FAMILY OF THREE."
29,ep159,"SCOTT'S FIANCéE MARY WOULD LIKE TO FIND A HOUSE WHERE SHE FEELS AS SAFE AND COMFORTABLE AS SHE DOES IN HER CURRENT TWO-BEDROOM CONDOMINIUM, A PLACE THAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER KORIN HAVE CALLED HOME FOR THREE YEARS."
30,ep159,"I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S A SECURE BUILDING AND THAT I'M ON THE SECOND FLOOR IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING, AND IT'S VERY QUIET, BUT I DO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO LIVES UNDERNEATH ME AND SOMEONE ABOVE ME, AND SO YOU DO HEAR NOISE FROM THE OTHER TENANTS."
31,ep159,"AND THIS IS A PERFECT SPOT IN TERMS OF LOCATION FOR ME TO GET TO WORK AND TO GET TO MY DAUGHTER KORIN'S SCHOOL, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY."
32,ep159,"AND BECAUSE IT'S A CONDO AND THERE ARE NEIGHBORS, IT ISN'T SUITABLE TO HAVE A MUSIC STUDIO."
33,ep159,(Suzanne) MARY ALREADY HAS IDEAS ABOUT WHAT QUALITIES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO HER IN A NEW HOUSE.
34,ep159,"(Mary) WELL, I GREW UP IN TWO-STORY HOUSES, BECAUSE I COME FROM A BIG FAMILY."
35,ep159,"AND WE ALWAYS HAD TWO-STORY HOUSES, BECAUSE WE NEEDED AT LEAST FOUR BEDROOMS, YOU KNOW, AND THREE BATHROOMS."
36,ep159,"IT WOULD BE IDEAL FOR ME, IF WE COULD FIND A TWO-STORY HOUSE."
37,ep159,(Suzanne) MARY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO FIND A HOUSE WITH A MORE SPACIOUS KITCHEN THAN THE NARROW AREA SHE HAS IN HER CONDO.
38,ep159,EVEN KORIN HAS SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS IN A NEW HOUSE.
39,ep159,"ON HER WISH LIST ARE A BEDROOM WITH A BATHROOM ATTACHED TO IT, A BALCONY AND A FIREPLACE."
40,ep159,"WHILE SCOTT AND MARY ARE EXCITED AT THE THOUGHT OF STARTING THEIR NEW LIFE TOGETHER, THEY ARE ALSO AWARE THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT TASK AHEAD OF THEM."
41,ep159,"BOTH OF US HAVE BEEN SINGLE FOR A LONG TIME, AND COMBINING HOUSEHOLDS CAN BE STRESSFUL, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THINGS WE WANNA SAVE AND WHAT THINGS WE WANNA GET RID OF."
42,ep159,"(Suzanne) WITH MARRIAGE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR, SCOTT AND MARY DECIDE TO DRIVE THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY THINK MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE TO START THEIR LIFE TOGETHER."
43,ep159,THEY SEE AN OPEN HOUSE AND AGREE TO TAKE A LOOK.
44,ep159,(Mary) NICE LANDSCAPING.
45,ep159,SLATE PORCH.
46,ep159,LOOK AT THIS DOORWAY.
47,ep159,HIGH CEILINGS.
48,ep159,REALLY HIGH CEILINGS!
49,ep159,REALLY HIGH CEILINGS!
50,ep159,WOW! PERFECT FOR YOU.
51,ep159,"WOW, THEY MUST BE LIKE 20 FEET TALL."
52,ep159,LOOK AT THE STAIRCASE AND THE BALCONY!
53,ep159,"THERE'S A FIREPLACE BACK THERE, I THINK."
54,ep159,OKAY. SAYS SHE WANTS A FIREPLACE.
55,ep159,KORIN SAYS SHE WANTS A FIREPLACE.
56,ep159,YEAH. ON HER LIST.
57,ep159,IT LOOKS GOOD WITH TILE AND BRICK.
58,ep159,"AH, WOW!"
59,ep159,"HEY, A BLACK AND WHITE KITCHEN."
60,ep159,"HEY, A BLACK AND WHITE KITCHEN."
61,ep159,KITCHEN LOOKS GREAT.
62,ep159,KITCHEN LOOKS GREAT.
63,ep159,LET'S CHECK OUT THE BEDROOMS.
64,ep159,LET'S CHECK OUT THE BEDROOMS.
65,ep159,OKAY. LOOKS GOOD.
66,ep159,BE GREAT FOR KORIN...
67,ep159,BE GREAT FOR KORIN...
68,ep159,IT WOULD.
69,ep159,IT WOULD.
70,ep159,AND WHAT'S THIS OVER HERE?
71,ep159,AND THIS IS A BATHROOM IN HERE.
72,ep159,"OH, YEAH!"
73,ep159,THIS WOULD BE GREAT FOR KORIN.
74,ep159,KORIN COULD HAVE HER OWN BATHROOM.
75,ep159,KORIN COULD HAVE HER OWN BATHROOM.
76,ep159,"YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS, BUT WE'RE NOT READY FOR A HOUSE YET."
77,ep159,I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT MY HOUSE ON THE MARKET YET.
78,ep159,I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT MY HOUSE ON THE MARKET YET.
79,ep159,"I KNOW, I KNOW, AND THEN MY HOUSE."
80,ep159,I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO AHEAD AND MAKE AN OFFER OR DO ANYTHING.
81,ep159,WE CAN LIKE THIS HOUSE.
82,ep159,WE CAN LIKE THIS HOUSE.
83,ep159,WE'RE NOT READY.
84,ep159,WE'RE NOT READY.
85,ep159,"WE CAN LOVE THIS HOUSE, BUT WE CAN'T GET ATTACHED."
86,ep159,THAT'S RIGHT.
87,ep159,"(Suzanne) WHILE SCOTT AND MARY THINK THE HOUSE HAS A LOT OF FEATURES THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, THEY AGREE THAT THEY AREN'T QUITE READY TO BUY."
88,ep159,"IN THIS CASE, THE EXPRESSION LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION ISN'T AS ACCURATE AS TIMING IS EVERYTHING."
89,ep159,WILL SCOTT AND MARY BE ABLE TO FIND A HOUSE WITHIN THEIR TIME FRAME?
90,ep159,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
91,ep159,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
92,ep159,"SCOTT MAXSON AND MARY CALLUZA RECENTLY BEGAN HOUSE HUNTING AND FOUND A HOUSE THAT SEEMED TO SUIT THEIR NEEDS, BUT THE TIMING WAS LESS THAN PERFECT."
93,ep159,THE COUPLE WAS STILL WEEKS AWAY FROM GETTING MARRIED AND NOT IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO BUY A HOUSE.
94,ep159,"SINCE THEN, MARY AND SCOTT HAVE WED, AND SCOTT HAS SOLD HIS HOME AND MOVED INTO THE CONDO MARY SHARES WITH HER EIGHT- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER KORIN."
95,ep159,THIS NEW FAMILY IS NOW READY TO OFFICIALLY START HOUSE HUNTING.
96,ep159,MARY AND SCOTT HAVE DECIDED TO LOOK WITHOUT THE HELP OF A REALTOR.
97,ep159,"WHILE THIS MEANS A LOT MORE EFFORT ON THEIR PART, THEY PLAN TO LOOK SOLELY AT OPEN HOUSES."
98,ep159,"THEY ALSO THINK THEY COULD GET A BETTER DEAL, IF THE HOUSE IS FOR SALE BY OWNER."
99,ep159,THE FIRST HOME THAT FITS THE BILL IS A LARGE DUPLEX.
100,ep159,"MOM, IT HAS A FIREPLACE!"
101,ep159,IT DOES...
102,ep159,THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
103,ep159,IT'S BIG IN HERE.
104,ep159,IT'S BIG IN HERE.
105,ep159,IT IS BIG.
106,ep159,IT IS BIG.
107,ep159,LOOK AT THE MOLDING.
108,ep159,LOOK AT THE MOLDING.
109,ep159,AND THEY'VE GOT HARDWOOD FLOORS.
110,ep159,AND THEY'VE GOT HARDWOOD FLOORS.
111,ep159,LET'S GO OVER HERE.
112,ep159,LET'S GO OVER HERE.
113,ep159,OKAY. THE DUPLEX LOOKS GOOD SO FAR AND HAS THE FIREPLACE THAT WAS ON KORIN'S WISH LIST.
114,ep159,HERE'S THE KITCHEN.
115,ep159,HERE'S THE KITCHEN.
116,ep159,OH! THERE'S A PINK STOVE...
117,ep159,MY FAVORITE COLOR!
118,ep159,IT IS PINK...
119,ep159,"WOW! LOT OF GREEN TILE IN HERE, TOO."
120,ep159,BUT IT HAS A LOT OF CUPBOARDS AND A WINDOW...
121,ep159,DOUBLE SINK.
122,ep159,"OKAY... MIGHT BE A LITTLE SMALL, THOUGH."
123,ep159,YEAH... A LITTLE SMALL.
124,ep159,"(Suzanne) THE FAMILY DECIDES TO LOOK AROUND THE DUPLEX, AND EVEN KORIN SEEMS TO HAVE IDEAS OF HER OWN."
125,ep159,"HEY, MOM, THIS COULD BE MY ROOM, AND IT HAS A PINK BATHROOM."
126,ep159,NICE BIG MASTER BEDROOM.
127,ep159,"IT IS A BIG ROOM, BUT IT REALLY IS A FIXER-UPPER."
128,ep159,BUT IT REALLY IS A FIXER-UPPER.
129,ep159,"YEAH. LOOKS LIKE NEW CARPET, NEW PAINT."
130,ep159,THE WALLS NEED TO BE FIXED.
131,ep159,IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK.
132,ep159,IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK.
133,ep159,AT LEAST I FIT THROUGH THE DOORWAY.
134,ep159,AT LEAST I FIT THROUGH THE DOORWAY.
135,ep159,I THINK THEY'VE DONE SOME ANTIQUING IN HERE.
136,ep159,I THINK THEY'VE DONE SOME ANTIQUING IN HERE.
137,ep159,"YEAH. HAS A NICE FIREPLACE, BUT..."
138,ep159,"IT DOES HAVE A NICE FIREPLACE, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE."
139,ep159,I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANNA DO THAT.
140,ep159,PLUS THE NEIGHBORS ARE RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.
141,ep159,I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WORKS FOR MY STUDIO.
142,ep159,I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WORKS FOR MY STUDIO.
143,ep159,I KNOW.
144,ep159,I KNOW.
145,ep159,I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR US.
146,ep159,"(Suzanne) WITHOUT A REALTOR, THE MAXSONS MUST FIND HOMES TO TOUR ON THEIR OWN."
147,ep159,"SO AFTER DISCUSSING THE DRAWBACKS OF BUYING A DUPLEX, THEY CONSULT THE NEWSPAPER AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER OPEN HOUSE, THIS ONE, A SINGLE FAMILY HOME."
148,ep159,NICE ROOM.
149,ep159,OH! HOUSE.
150,ep159,NICE HOUSE.
151,ep159,LOOK AT HOW HIGH THE CEILINGS ARE.

158,ep159,THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
159,ep159,THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
160,ep159,(Suzanne) THIS HOUSE LOOKS PROMISING.
161,ep159,IT'S IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THE FAMILY LOVES AND THE COMMON ROOMS ARE LARGE AND OPEN.
162,ep159,(Mary) IT'S A FAMILY ROOM OFF THE KITCHEN.
163,ep159,LET'S GO SEE THE MASTER BEDROOM.
164,ep159,(Scott) HOW MANY BEDROOMS ARE IN THIS HOUSE?
165,ep159,(Scott) HOW MANY BEDROOMS ARE IN THIS HOUSE?

171,ep159,IT'S A SMALL KITCHEN.
172,ep159,IT'S A SMALL KITCHEN.
173,ep159,YEAH. REFRIGERATOR IS VERY BIG IN THIS SMALL KITCHEN.
174,ep159,"(Suzanne) WHILE THIS HOUSE IS CLOSE TO THE SCHOOL WHERE MARY AND SCOTT WORK, IT IS TOO SMALL FOR THEIR NEW FAMILY."
175,ep159,"(Mary) IT WAS A REALLY NICE HOUSE, BUT IT ONLY HAS..."
176,ep159,BUT IT ONLY HAS...
177,ep159,(Korin) BUT IT ONLY HAS TWO BEDROOMS.
178,ep159,(Korin) BUT IT ONLY HAS TWO BEDROOMS.
179,ep159,"YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT-- ONLY TWO BEDROOMS."
180,ep159,YEAH... THINK WE NEED THREE.
181,ep159,(Suzanne) WILL SCOTT AND MARY BE ABLE TO FIND A HOME THAT MEETS THEIR FAMILY'S NEEDS WITHOUT THE HELP OF A REALTOR?
182,ep159,(Mary) HI...
183,ep159,WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE HOUSE.
184,ep159,(Suzanne) THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.
185,ep159,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
186,ep159,NEWLYWEDS SCOTT AND MARY MAXSON ARE DETERMINED TO FIND A HOUSE WITHOUT THE HELP OF A REALTOR.
187,ep159,"DISAPPOINTED FROM WHAT THEY'VE SEEN SO FAR, THE NEWLYWEDS DECIDE TO DRIVE PAST THE HOUSE THEY SAW BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED."
188,ep159,THEY'RE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THERE IS STILL A FOR SALE SIGN ON THE LAWN.
189,ep159,"NOW THAT THE COUPLE IS IN A POSITION TO BUY, THEY DECIDE TO GO IN AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE HOUSE."
190,ep159,LET'S SEE IF SOMEBODY'S HERE.
191,ep159,YEAH... RING THE DOORBELL.

201,ep159,OKAY. YOU THE OWNER?
202,ep159,ARE YOU THE OWNER?
203,ep159,"NO... A FRIEND OF THE OWNER'S, NO..."
204,ep159,"I'M A FRIEND OF THE OWNER'S, AND I'M HELPING HIM OUT TODAY."
205,ep159,AND I'M HELPING HIM OUT TODAY.
206,ep159,"OH, OKAY."
207,ep159,"OH, OKAY."
208,ep159,"GREAT. ACTUALLY SAW THE HOUSE BEFORE, WE ACTUALLY SAW THE HOUSE BEFORE, BUT WE DIDN'T GO UPSTAIRS."

210,ep159,"OH, WELL, PLEASE..."
211,ep159,"OH, WELL, PLEASE..."
212,ep159,"WE SAW THE SIGN THAT IT WAS STILL FOR SALE, SO WE WANTED TO COME IN."

301,ep159,"THE NEXT DAY, THE FAMILY DRIVES BY THE HOUSE ONCE AGAIN TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS IN FACT THE RIGHT HOUSE FOR THEM."
302,ep159,"(Mary) SCOTT, I DON'T SEE THE FOR SALE SIGN."
303,ep159,LOOKS LIKE THE FOR SALE SIGN IS DOWN.

316,ep159,"WE'RE NEAR THE PROPERTY, AND WE NOTICED THAT THE SIGN WAS DOWN."
317,ep159,"OH, I SEE..."
318,ep159,"UH-HUH. THE HOME'S OWNER TELLS MARY THAT AN OFFER HAS BEEN MADE ON THE HOUSE, BUT THE SELLER AGREES THE MAXSONS 72 HOURS TO SUBMIT A BACKUP OFFER."
319,ep159,"THEN IF THE INITIAL OFFER ON THE HOUSE FALLS THROUGH, SCOTT AND MARY'S OFFER WILL BE CONSIDERED."
320,ep159,THE MAXSONS ARE NOW DETERMINED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET THE HOUSE.
321,ep159,"BY FIRST THING THE NEXT MORNING, SCOTT AND MARY HAVE THE PAPERWORK COMPLETED."
322,ep159,"THEY DON'T HAVE A REALTOR, BUT THE MAXSONS FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT WRITING UP THE OFFER THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AS HOMEOWNERS."
323,ep159,THEY ALSO KNOW THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO REQUEST ANY CHANGES THEY'D LIKE THE SELLER TO MAKE TO THE HOUSE.

333,ep159,I THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE AT THE HOUSE HERE.
334,ep159,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
335,ep159,YEAH... GOOD.
336,ep159,"(Suzanne) WILL MARY AND SCOTT'S OFFER BE ACCEPTED, OR WILL THEY HAVE TO START THEIR SEARCH ALL OVER?"

338,ep159,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
339,ep159,MARY AND SCOTT MAXSON HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH A HOUSE THAT'S FOR SALE BY OWNER.
340,ep159,BUT THEY TOOK SOME TIME TO CONSIDER IT BEFORE MAKING AN OFFER.
341,ep159,"WHILE THE COUPLE WAS CONTEMPLATING, ANOTHER OFFER WAS MADE ON THE HOUSE."
342,ep159,"THE SELLER THEN TOLD THE MAXSONS THEIR OFFER WOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY IF THE FIRST OFFER FELL THROUGH, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED."
343,ep159,"NOW SCOTT, MARY AND EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KORIN ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEIR OFFER."
344,ep159,(Phone ringing) HELLO.

354,ep159,WE GOT THE HOUSE!
355,ep159,WE GOT THE HOUSE!
356,ep159,GREAT! ACCEPTED THE OFFER.

358,ep159,FANTASTIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH...
359,ep159,WOW! WE GOT THAT DREAM HOUSE ♪ ♪ WE GOT THAT DREAM HOUSE ♪ THE DREAM HOUSE IS OURS.
360,ep159,"(Suzanne) JUST MONTHS AFTER THEIR SEARCH BEGAN, THE MAXSONS HAVE MOVED INTO THEIR DREAM HOUSE."
361,ep159,"WHILE BUYING THE HOUSE WITHOUT A REALTOR WAS CHALLENGING, THIS COUPLE CREDITS THEIR SUCCESS TO THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE THEY EACH GAINED FROM BUYING THEIR PRIOR HOMES."
362,ep159,"WE BROUGHT THAT KNOWLEDGE WITH US WHEN WE WERE BUYING THIS HOUSE, AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS HOUSE WITHOUT A REAL ESTATE AGENT."
363,ep159,AND IT WORKED OUT FOR US BECAUSE WE HAD HAD THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST.
364,ep159,"(Suzanne) THE COUPLE'S PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE HELPED THEM SECURE THE HOUSE, BUT IT WAS THEIR FIRST IMPRESSION, WHICH SOLD THEM ON IT IN THE FIRST PLACE."
365,ep159,"IN FACT, NOW THAT THE MAXSONS ARE MOVED IN, THEY'RE FINDING NEW THINGS TO APPRECIATE ABOUT THE HOUSE EVERY DAY."
366,ep159,"(Mary) IN OUR NEW KITCHEN, THERE ARE THREE WINDOWS, THE CEILINGS ARE HIGH AND IT HAS AN ISLAND, SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY WALK THROUGH THE WHOLE KITCHEN, WHICH IS NICE."
367,ep159,YOU CAN COME TO THE KITCHEN FROM DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE HOUSE.
368,ep159,"(Suzanne) IN THE END, THEIR NEW HOME HAS EVERYTHING THEY WANTED AND MORE."
369,ep159,(Mary) WE WERE LOOKING FOR A FIREPLACE...
370,ep159,WE GOT THAT.
371,ep159,"WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BALCONY, AND WE ENDED UP GETTING TWO BALCONIES."
372,ep159,"AND WE WANTED THE GARAGE CONVERTED, SO IT COULD BE USED AS A STUDIO RATHER THAN A GARAGE, AND IT WAS ALREADY SET UP TO BE AN OFFICE, SO WE GOT THAT."
373,ep159,"(Scott) EVENTUALLY, THE GARAGE SPACE WILL WORK PERFECT FOR MY STUDIO."
374,ep159,I DO NEED TO DO A FEW THINGS TO IT AND UNPACK MY BOXES AND GET THE ROOM SORT OF SOUNDPROOFED AND WEATHERIZED A LITTLE MORE.
375,ep159,"IT'LL TAKE ME A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET THE STUDIO COMPLETELY READY FOR MYSELF TO BE RECORDING MUSIC, COMPOSING, PRINTING OUT MY SCORES AND THE MARIMBA, VIBES..."
376,ep159,EVERYTHING. I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.
377,ep159,IT'S ONE OF THE LAST HURDLES TO GET THE WHOLE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING AT ITS FULL FUNCTIONING LEVEL.
378,ep159,"(Suzanne) EVEN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KORIN IS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW HOUSE, PARTICULARLY HER NEW BEDROOM, AND THE THING THAT TOPPED HER WISH LIST FROM THE BEGINNING-- HER OWN SEPARATE BATHROOM."
379,ep159,"AND THOUGH KORIN WASN'T ACCUSTOM TO HAVING HER OWN BACKYARD, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GROWN QUITE USED TO IT."
380,ep159,"WITH PLANS TO EXPAND THEIR FAMILY, THE COUPLE APPRECIATES ALL THE EXTRA SPACE THIS HOME PROVIDES."
381,ep159,"(Scott) NOW THAT WE'VE SETTLED IN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, IT'S VERY POSSIBLE WE COULD HAVE A CHILD."
382,ep159,WE FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT BEING READY ENOUGH FOR THAT.
383,ep159,AND THERE'S A BEDROOM THAT CAN BE USED FOR ANY NEW ADDITION TO THE FAMILY.
384,ep159,FOR ANY NEW ADDITION TO THE FAMILY.
385,ep159,"YEAH. SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, AND IT'S NICE NOW TO HAVE THE HOUSE WHERE WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ROOM, AND WE HAVE THE SPACE, IF WE DECIDE TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD THAT WE'RE PREPARED FOR."
386,ep159,THE MAXSONS WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL OF BUYING THEIR DREAM HOUSE ON THEIR OWN TERMS.
387,ep159,"NOW WITH THOUGHTS OF EXPANDING THEIR FAMILY, THE MAXSONS MAY BE LOOKING FOR A NEW LARGER HOME SOONER THAN THEY THINK."

1,ep160,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep160,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep160,BOB AND LISA WADLEY HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THEIR RENTAL HOME IS GOING TO BE TORN DOWN.
4,ep160,SO THEY'VE DECIDED TO SEIZE THE MOMENT AND BUY A HOME OF THEIR OWN.
5,ep160,WILL BOB AND LISA BE ABLE TO FIND A HOME IN A HURRY WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK?
6,ep160,IT'S ALL COMING UP NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
7,ep160,♪♪ BOB AND LISA WADLEY RELOCATED FROM TENNESSEE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NINE MONTHS AGO WHEN BOB'S COMPANY OFFERED HIM A PROMOTION AND A TRANSFER.
8,ep160,IT WAS A LARGE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO MAKE THE MOVE.
9,ep160,NOT TO MENTION THE FACT WE'RE GOOD OL' SOUTHERN PEOPLE AND MOVING TO LOS ANGELES!
10,ep160,THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM HOME.
11,ep160,IT'S A LONG WAY FROM OUR FAMILIES.
12,ep160,(Suzanne) THEY DECIDED TO RENT TO EASE THEIR TRANSITION INTO THE AREA.
13,ep160,BROUGHT YOU SOME COFFEE.
14,ep160,THANK YOU.
15,ep160,(Suzanne) THEIR RENTAL HOME HAS HELPED THEM DISCOVER WHAT THEY LOVE ABOUT LIVING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
16,ep160,"(Lisa) SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS HOUSE, OF COURSE, IS THE VIEW."
17,ep160,THAT'S WHAT REALLY DREW US TO IT...
18,ep160,JUST ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
19,ep160,WE CAN SIT ON ANY PATIO AREA ALL THE WAY AROUND THE HOUSE AND HAVE A GORGEOUS VIEW OF TREETOPS AND A HAWK FLYING OVER AND DUCKS COME IN FOR LANDINGS ON THE LAKE DOWN ACROSS THE STREET.
20,ep160,IT'S JUST A GORGEOUS HOUSE.
21,ep160,"YEAH, IT REALLY IS."
22,ep160,"(Suzanne) THE WADLEY'S RENTAL HOUSE SEEMED LIKE THE IDEAL SITUATION UNTIL THEY LEARNED THE HOUSE HAS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE, AND THE OWNERS HAVE DECIDED TO TEAR IT DOWN."
23,ep160,NOW BOB AND LISA HAVE TO FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE.
24,ep160,"LUCKILY BOB'S COMPANY WILL PAY THE CLOSING COSTS ON A HOME PURCHASE, IF THE WADLEY'S BUY A HOME WITHIN THE NEXT 90 DAYS."
25,ep160,SO THEY'VE DECIDED TO BUY AND HOPE THEY CAN FIND A HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA THAT COMPARES WITH THE ONE THEY LEFT IN TENNESSEE.
26,ep160,WE HAD A GREAT HOUSE IN TENNESSEE.
27,ep160,"WE HAD A FOUR- BEDROOM HOUSE THAT ONE WE USED AS LIKE A MUSIC ROOM, A STUDY, A BATH AND A HALF, HUMONGOUS KITCHEN THAT PEOPLE WOULD KILL FOR..."
28,ep160,YEAH. DINING AREA AND LIVING AREA AND THEN TWO ACRES OF LAND.
29,ep160,"(Suzanne) THE COUPLE LOVES TO COOK, SO THE KITCHEN IS IMPORTANT."
30,ep160,"THE ONE IN THE RENTAL HOUSE WORKS, BUT IT'S A LITTLE SMALL."
31,ep160,"(Lisa) I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BIG KITCHEN, BUT I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE OUT HERE."
32,ep160,"SO IF WE CAN JUST FIND ONE THAT HAS ENOUGH SPACE FOR ME TO STORE THINGS AND HAVE PANTRY SPACE, THEN THAT WOULD BE GREAT."
33,ep160,(Suzanne) AND THEY WANT AN OUTDOOR LIVING SPACE.
34,ep160,(Bob) ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A HOUSE IS SOMEPLACE OUTSIDE WHERE WE CAN GRILL AND ENTERTAIN AND HAVE PEOPLE OVER AND JUST ENJOY BEING OUTSIDE.
35,ep160,"(Suzanne) THEY HAVE LOTS OF AMENITIES IN THE RENTAL, BUT WANT ONE MORE EXTRA IN THE NEW PLACE."
36,ep160,"AND WE ALSO, OF COURSE, WANTED A SWIMMING POOL, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, YOU GOTTA HAVE A POOL."
37,ep160,YEAH... AS WELL.
38,ep160,(Suzanne) BOB AND LISA TAKE CHARGE AND HEAD OFF TO AN OPEN HOUSE IN THEIR CURRENT NEIGHBORHOOD WITH VISIONS OF THEIR NEW CALIFORNIA HOME FUELING THEIR ENTHUSIASM.
39,ep160,BUT THEN THE COLD SHOCK OF REALITY SETS IN.
40,ep160,"THEN WE WALKED OFF IN ONE OF THOSE OPEN HOUSES, AND I'M THINKING, OKAY, THIS IS NICE..."
41,ep160,WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.
42,ep160,"AND THEY QUOTED A PRICE TO US, AND I SAID, HOLY MOLY!"
43,ep160,"IT WAS, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!"
44,ep160,"WE REALLY WEREN'T SURE THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE OUT HERE BECAUSE OF THAT, BECAUSE OF THE PRICE TAG THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH 'EM."
45,ep160,WE REALLY WEREN'T SURE WE COULD HANDLE IT.
46,ep160,"IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT HOMES, AND ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND NO MATTER WHERE THE HOUSE IS, SOMEHOW YOU MAKE A HOME OUT OF IT."
47,ep160,"(Suzanne) BUT THE COUPLE DOESN'T ANTICIPATE LIVING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LONG TERM AND THAT MAKES THE DECISION ALL THE MORE NERVE-RACKING, SINCE THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS HOME PURCHASE IS ALSO A GOOD INVESTMENT."
48,ep160,"WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING INTO DEBT MORE THAN WE'VE EVER GONE INTO DEBT BEFORE IN OUR LIVES, AND YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET OUT HERE."
49,ep160,YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF IN A NEGATIVE EQUITY SITUATION THAT COULD BE VERY SERIOUS.
50,ep160,"RIGHT. THE WADLEY'S ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, SO LISA GOES OUT ALONE AND CAPTURES HER SEARCH ON VIDEO TAPE TO SHARE WITH BOB LATER."
51,ep160,WILL THEIR TIME-SAVING TACTICS PAY OFF?
52,ep160,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS CONTINUES.

56,ep160,TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
57,ep160,"NOT ONLY DOES THEIR RENTAL HOME HAVE A DATE WITH THE WRECKING BALL DUE TO RECENTLY DISCOVERED STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS, BUT BOB'S COMPANY WILL PAY THEIR CLOSING COSTS, IF THEY CAN BUY A HOME IN THE NEXT 90 DAYS."

59,ep160,"GUIDING THEM THROUGH THE INS AND OUTS OF BUYING IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MARKET IS RENI ROSE, THE REALTOR WHO FOUND THEIR FABULOUS RENTAL HOUSE."
60,ep160,(Reni) IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND AND TO EMPATHIZE WITH THEM.
61,ep160,"BEING FROM THE SOUTH MYSELF, I KNEW AND COULD UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE WADLEYS WOULD FEEL."
62,ep160,"HAVING MOVED FROM THE SOUTH WHERE THE LAND WAS MORE GENEROUS, THE HOMES WERE MORE GENEROUS, THE PRICES WERE A LOT LESS."
63,ep160,"COMING OUT HERE AND FINDING SMALLER PROPERTIES, SMALLER HOMES, STICKER SHOCK, ONCE AGAIN."
64,ep160,(Suzanne) THE WADLEYS ARE DEPENDING ON RENI TO GUIDE THEM TO THE RIGHT HOUSE AT THE RIGHT PRICE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

151,ep160,"YOU'VE SEEN THESE THINGS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, AND I'M NOT REAL SURE."
152,ep160,I USUALLY DEPEND ON YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT THESE THINGS.
153,ep160,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW?
154,ep160,"UM, I LIKE BOTH THE HOUSES."
155,ep160,IT'S MADE ME AWARE THAT I KIND OF LIKE THE VAULTED CEILINGS.
156,ep160,RIGHT. I REALLY THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAN WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR.
157,ep160,I THINK WE HAVE TOO MUCH STUFF!
158,ep160,AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM!
159,ep160,THAT'S RIGHT.
160,ep160,THEY'RE REALLY NICE...
161,ep160,THEY'RE REALLY NICE.
162,ep160,"AND ALSO, I'VE NOTICED NO POOL YET, AND WE WERE REALLY KIND OF..."
163,ep160,"YEAH... WITH TIME RUNNING SHORT, CAN LISA FIND A CALIFORNIA DREAM HOUSE..."
164,ep160,IT'S A VERY NICE STYLE FIREPLACE.
165,ep160,AND A FIREPLACE.
166,ep160,(Suzanne) ...
167,ep160,THAT WILL ALSO APPEAL TO BOB?
168,ep160,STAY TUNED.
169,ep160,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS...
170,ep160,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
171,ep160,"BOB AND LISA WADLEY RELOCATED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM TENNESSEE, WAITING NEARLY A YEAR TO VENTURE INTO THE EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET."
172,ep160,"WHILE BOB'S AT WORK, LISA AND THEIR REALTOR RENI ROSE ARE TOURING HOUSES."
173,ep160,LISA VIDEO TAPES THE HOMES FOR BOB TO SEE LATER.
174,ep160,"AFTER TAPING MORE THAN A DOZEN HOUSES, THEY STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT ONE, BUT THEIR REALTOR HAS A SURPRISE IN STORE."
175,ep160,"NOW LISA, THIS HOUSE IS NOT OFFICIALLY LISTED."
176,ep160,THE OWNERS ARE DOING SOME UPGRADES.
177,ep160,"OKAY. REMOVED CARPETING, AND THEY'RE PAINTING A FEW ROOMS."
178,ep160,"SOME OF THEM ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF BEING PAINTED, SO HAVE A LOT OF VISION WHEN YOU WALK IN."
179,ep160,OKAY. THERE'S THE KITCHEN.
180,ep160,WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT.
181,ep160,OOH! THIS A GREAT ROOM?
182,ep160,THIS IS HUGE!
183,ep160,I NEED TO GET THIS FOR BOB.
184,ep160,WHAT IS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THIS?
185,ep160,NOW THIS ONE'S BIGGER THAN THE ONES WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST.
186,ep160,"THIS ONE IS JUST OVER 1,600 SQUARE FEET."
187,ep160,"OH, YOU'RE KIDDING..."
188,ep160,THAT'S GREAT.
189,ep160,"GOT A FEW SURPRISES IN THIS ONE I WANNA SHOW YOU, TOO."
190,ep160,SO ONCE YOU GET THIS ON FILM...
191,ep160,"ALL RIGHT, I'M READY."
192,ep160,"ALL RIGHT, THEN WE'RE GONNA GO OUT THIS WAY IN THE BACKYARD."
193,ep160,"OH, OUTSIDE!"
194,ep160,"WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
195,ep160,"IT HAS A POOL, RENI!"
196,ep160,THIS IS YOUR SURPRISE.
197,ep160,AND IT'S GOT A BUILT-IN BARBECUE.
198,ep160,"OH, WOW!"
199,ep160,LOOK AT THIS POOL!
200,ep160,"THIS IS HUGE, RENI!"
201,ep160,I JUST KNEW YOU'D LOVE THIS.
202,ep160,THIS IS YOUR SURPRISE.
203,ep160,"OH, WOW..."
204,ep160,LET ME TAPE THIS.
205,ep160,"NOW WHEN YOU PAN OUT TO SEE THE POOL DOWN THERE AND THE BACKYARD, COME OVER THIS WAY..."
206,ep160,DON'T FORGET TO GET THE SPA.
207,ep160,"OH, WOW!"
208,ep160,YOU GOT YOUR CELL PHONE?
209,ep160,I DO.
210,ep160,WOULD YOU CARE IF I CALL BOB?
211,ep160,I KNEW YOU'D LIKE THIS...
212,ep160,NO PROBLEM...
213,ep160,HERE YOU GO.
214,ep160,"(Suzanne) EVEN BEFORE SHE SEES THE REST OF THE HOUSE, LISA HAS A GOOD FEELING ABOUT IT, ONE SHE THINKS BOB WILL SHARE."
215,ep160,HI. YOU GET AWAY FOR A FEW MINUTES?
216,ep160,I'M... AT THE LAST HOUSE ON OUR LIST.
217,ep160,I HAVE A HUGE SURPRISE FOR YOU.
218,ep160,ALL RIGHT...
219,ep160,BYE. HE CAN COME?
220,ep160,YES. SAYS HE CAN GET AWAY FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES.
221,ep160,THAT'S GREAT.
222,ep160,"WELL, I HAVE TO SHOW YOU THE REST OF THE HOUSE!"
223,ep160,OKAY! IT HAS SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
224,ep160,"(Suzanne) SINCE THE HOUSE IS ONLY MINUTES AWAY FROM WHERE BOB WORKS, IT TAKES HIM ALMOST NO TIME AT ALL TO MAKE THE COMMUTE, A SELLING POINT HE LIKES RIGHT OFF THE BAT."
225,ep160,"NOW THIS IN HERE IS THE FAMILY ROOM, WHICH IS LOCATED JUST OFF THE KITCHEN."
226,ep160,THIS IS NICE...
227,ep160,THIS HAS VAULTED CEILINGS.
228,ep160,"MM-HMM. A FIREPLACE, TOO."
229,ep160,ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID YOU WANTED.
230,ep160,(Bob) LISA?
231,ep160,YES... HERE!
232,ep160,HEY. BOB.
233,ep160,THIS IS REALLY NICE.
234,ep160,"YEAH. VAULTED CEILINGS, BUT I HAVE A BIG SURPRISE."
235,ep160,OKAY. SAVED THE BEST FOR YOU.
236,ep160,OKAY. YOU READY?
237,ep160,YEP. ON.
238,ep160,LOOK AT THIS.
239,ep160,I SEE THIS.
240,ep160,THIS IS YOUR HUGE SURPRISE.
241,ep160,"WE NEED LIKE THIS, THE POOL, THE SPA, THE COVERED PATIO."
242,ep160,IT'S GOT A BUILT- IN BARBECUE.
243,ep160,YEAH. GOT A LOT OF WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.
244,ep160,I NOTICED THE FIREPLACES.
245,ep160,AND OUR SQUARE FOOTAGE.
246,ep160,"OH, THAT."
247,ep160,HOW MANY SQUARE FOOT IS IT?
248,ep160,"OVER 1,600."
249,ep160,YEP. THINK THIS MAY BE THE ONE.
250,ep160,ALL THE SPACE BACK THERE.
251,ep160,"I MEAN, I'VE SEEN THE INSIDE."
252,ep160,YOU NEED TO GO SEE THE INSIDE.
253,ep160,I DO NEED TO SEE THE INSIDE.
254,ep160,LET ME SHOW YOU.
255,ep160,OKAY. LET ME TAKE YOU GUYS INTO THE KITCHEN.
256,ep160,"OKAY. THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING, THE BUILT-IN MICROWAVE, THE OVEN, THE COOKTOP OVER THERE."
257,ep160,"I COULD LIVE WITH THIS, BUT I CAN SEE SOME THINGS I'D LIKE TO DO."
258,ep160,"OH, OF COURSE..."
259,ep160,OF COURSE.
260,ep160,LIKE FOR MORE CABINET SPACE.
261,ep160,"SURE... THEY'RE GONNA REDO THE KITCHEN, TELL 'EM..."
262,ep160,DON'T TOUCH IT.
263,ep160,"DON'T. THIS IS THE ONE WE GO WITH, WE WOULD WANNA DO THAT OURSELVES."
264,ep160,OKAY. CAN BE SURE TO PASS THAT ON.
265,ep160,"OKAY. BOB, IF YOU GO THAT WAY, I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE BEDROOMS."
266,ep160,ALL RIGHT.
267,ep160,"OH, I REALLY LIKE THIS."
268,ep160,IT'S A HUGE ROOM.
269,ep160,I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.
270,ep160,THIS IS QUITE SPACIOUS.
271,ep160,"IT EVEN HAS THREE CLOSETS IN HERE, TWO FOR LISA, ONE FOR BOB."
272,ep160,"NOW IF YOU GO OVER TO YOUR LEFT, THERE'S A MASTER BATH."
273,ep160,"NOW THIS IS THE THREE-QUARTER MASTER BATH, AND IT'S IN FAIRLY GOOD CONDITION."
274,ep160,IT'S IN REAL GOOD CONDITION.
275,ep160,WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO REDO THIS...
276,ep160,SUPER! GOOD.
277,ep160,ALL RIGHT.
278,ep160,"OH, I LIKE THIS ROOM."
279,ep160,I LIKE THE COLOR.
280,ep160,"YEAH. LIKE THIS HOUSE, BOB."
281,ep160,YEAH. THINK THIS COULD WORK.
282,ep160,IT FEELS GOOD.
283,ep160,YEAH. I'LL LET YOU GUYS DISCUSS IT.
284,ep160,OKAY. STEP OUT HERE.
285,ep160,THIS DOES HAVE A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.
286,ep160,IT'S GOT THE WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH.
287,ep160,"IT'S GOT THE SQUARE FOOTAGE, THE FIREPLACES WE WERE LOOKING FOR, THE CEILINGS AND, OF COURSE, THE POOL."
288,ep160,"IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS, I THINK WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT, BECAUSE THESE HOUSES MOVE REALLY QUICKLY AROUND HERE."
289,ep160,YEAH. I THINK THIS ONE WILL.
290,ep160,"YEAH, I THINK IT WILL, TOO."
291,ep160,RENI! RIGHT HERE.
292,ep160,YES? DECIDED WE WANNA MAKE A BID.
293,ep160,ALL RIGHT.
294,ep160,"(Suzanne) FINALLY, THE WADLEYS FIND A HOUSE THAT SPARKS THEIR INTEREST WITHOUT TORCHING THEIR BUDGET."
295,ep160,THE WADLEYS WRITE UP AN OFFER THEY THINK WILL WORK...
296,ep160,"OH, MAN!"
297,ep160,... THEN THEY WAIT.
298,ep160,NOW THAT THE WADLEYS HAVE FOUND THEIR IDEAL CALIFORNIA HOME WILL THEIR OFFER BE ACCEPTED?
299,ep160,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
300,ep160,WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
301,ep160,"AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH, LISA AND BOB WADLEY ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE SELLER'S REACTION TO THEIR OFFER."
302,ep160,"AFTER LOOKING AT 14 HOMES, THIS IS THE ONLY HOUSE THEY'VE SEEN THAT THEY LIKE, AND THEY'RE ON PINS AND NEEDLES."
303,ep160,THEN REALTOR RENI ROSE CALLS WITH THE NEWS.
304,ep160,(Ringing) HELLO.
305,ep160,"Lisa, guess what?"
306,ep160,It's Reni.
307,ep160,"HI, RENI."
308,ep160,"Hey, congratulations..."
309,ep160,They accepted the offer.
310,ep160,GREAT! I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU.
311,ep160,WE GOT THE HOUSE THAT WE WANTED.
312,ep160,THANK YOU.
313,ep160,Call Bob right away.
314,ep160,I'LL DO IT NOW.
315,ep160,Okay... RIGHT...
316,ep160,BYE-BYE. IT'S ME.
317,ep160,I HAVE NEWS.
318,ep160,WE'VE GOT THE HOUSE!
319,ep160,"(Suzanne) THRILLED TO HAVE FOUND A HOME THAT MORE THAN MEETS THEIR NEEDS AND TO HAVE DONE IT BEFORE THEIR TIME RAN OUT, THE WADLEYS HAVE WORKED HARD TURNING THIS HOUSE INTO A HOME."
320,ep160,WE ARE REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAVE FINALLY GOT SETTLED INTO THIS HOUSE.
321,ep160,"THERE'S STILL THINGS THAT WE WANNA DO, BUT WE CAN LIVE WITH THIS FOR A WHILE."
322,ep160,"(Suzanne) IN THE THREE WEEKS THEY'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE, BOB AND LISA HAVE BEEN BUSY PAINTING AND PUTTING IN NEW CARPET AND TILE, AND THEIR EFFORTS HAVE PAID OFF."
323,ep160,"WELL, LISA'S ALREADY SAID THIS ALREADY FEELS MORE LIKE HOME, AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT OWNING YOUR OWN HOME THAT DOES THAT."
324,ep160,"YEAH, IT HELPS."
325,ep160,"THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE FIXING UP THAT THAT'S FOR YOU, AND THAT YOU'RE GONNA REAP THE BENEFITS OF THAT, AND THERE'S JUST SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT OWNING YOUR OWN HOUSE."
326,ep160,"YEAH, IT IS."
327,ep160,(Suzanne) ALREADY THE COUPLE HAS GROWN ATTACHED TO THEIR FAVORITE PARTS OF THE HOUSE.
328,ep160,MY FAVORITE PART OF THE HOUSE IS PROBABLY THE DEN.
329,ep160,"NOW THAT IT'S DECORATED, IT'S COMFORTABLE..."
330,ep160,IT'S COZY.
331,ep160,YOU COME IN AT THE END OF THE DAY...
332,ep160,"IT'S A NICE PLACE TO RELAX, AND I PROBABLY SPEND MORE TIME THERE THAN I SHOULD."
333,ep160,"YES, 'CAUSE THE TV IS IN THE DEN, SO YEAH, AND WEEKENDS, ESPECIALLY, ONCE WE HAVE GOTTEN SETTLED."
334,ep160,"YEAH. IT IS NICE TO HAVE A NICE AREA TO JUST KICK BACK AND RELAX, AND THE DEN IS NICE."
335,ep160,BUT NOW I LIKE MY LIVING ROOM.
336,ep160,WHERE MY PIANO IS.
337,ep160,IT'S MY FAVORITE ROOM.
338,ep160,I KIND OF CLAIM IT AS MY ROOM.
339,ep160,"RIGHT. LISA AND BOB BOTH LOVE THEIR SPACIOUS MASTER BEDROOM, A LUXURY THEY DEEMED A NECESSITY DURING THEIR SEARCH FOR A HOME."
340,ep160,"GUEST BEDROOM, WE'RE STILL KIND OF..."
341,ep160,"I'M STILL KIND OF WORKING ON THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF THE GUEST BEDROOM/ COMPUTER ROOM/ CARRIE JO'S ROOM."
342,ep160,THAT'S CARRIE JO'S ROOM.
343,ep160,WHICH THE DOG...
344,ep160,SHE DOES.
345,ep160,SHE KIND OF CLAIMS THAT ROOM AS HERS.
346,ep160,THAT'S RIGHT.
347,ep160,"(Suzanne) THE HOME'S SECOND LIVING AREA HAS BECOME THE WADLEY'S FORMAL DINING ROOM, A SPACE THEY LOOK FORWARD TO ENJOYING WHEN THEIR TWO GROWN CHILDREN COME TO VISIT."
348,ep160,"EVEN THE KITCHEN, A PART OF THE HOUSE THE COUPLE WASN'T SURE THEY'D LIKE, HAS GROWN COMFORTABLE AFTER THEY REDECORATED IT TO SUIT THEIR TASTES."
349,ep160,"ALL IN ALL, THE WADLEY'S HOME HAS BECOME A SANCTUARY WHERE THE COUPLE CAN TRULY RELAX INSIDE AND OUT."
350,ep160,WE'VE REALLY ENJOYED THE POOL AREA.
351,ep160,"WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK LEFT THAT WE WANNA DO IN THE BACKYARD, AND WE'VE WORKED SO HARD ON THE INSIDE, WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY YET TO GET TO THE OUTSIDE."
352,ep160,"WELL, THE OUTSIDE IS OUR THING."
353,ep160,THAT'S WHERE WE LOVE TO SPEND THE TIME.
354,ep160,NOW WE'RE READY FOR THE OUTSIDE.
355,ep160,YEAH. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUN IN THE HUNT ITSELF.
356,ep160,"BUT THERE'S ALSO A GREAT DEAL OF RELIEF WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF IT TO KNOW THAT, OKAY, THIS PART'S AND WE CAN FINALLY RELAX."
357,ep160,WE CAN RELAX.
358,ep160,THIS IS ONE COUPLE WHO CERTAINLY DESERVES A LITTLE RELAXATION.
359,ep160,"AFTER OVERCOMING A SERIOUS BOUT OF STICKER SHOCK AND A TROUBLING TIME CRUNCH, THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR THE WADLEYS TO DO IS TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR."
360,ep160,I'M SUZANNE WHANG...
361,ep160,THANKS FOR WATCHING.

364,ep160,♪♪ ♪♪
392,ep160,WELCOME TO
1,ep161,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep161,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep161,MICHAEL AND LINDA GREEN ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THEIR INSTINCTS.
4,ep161,"SO WHEN THEY DECIDED THEY WERE UNHAPPY WITH THEIR HOME, THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE."
5,ep161,"BUT NOT ONLY DO THEY NEED TO FIND A NEW HOUSE, THEY HAVE TO SELL THEIR OLD ONE AND MAKE SURE THE WHOLE TRANSACTION TIMES OUT JUST RIGHT."
6,ep161,CAN THEY DO IT...
7,ep161,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep161,♪♪ LINDA AND MICHAEL GREEN HAVE OWNED THEIR CURRENT TOWNHOUSE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.
9,ep161,"ALTHOUGH, THIS IS THE FIRST HOME THE TWO HAVE PURCHASED AS A COUPLE, THE GREENS ARE NO STRANGERS TO HOUSE HUNTING."
10,ep161,(Linda) WE'RE SORT OF GYPSIES.
11,ep161,WE ENJOY THE WHOLE PROCESS OF MOVING.
12,ep161,"I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT WE LIKE TO SORT OF CLEAN THINGS OUT AND GO TO A NEW PLACE AND REARRANGE ALL OUR STUFF."
13,ep161,"AND EVERY TIME WE MOVE, WE SEEM TO FIND SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN WHERE WE LIVED BEFORE."
14,ep161,SO IT'S KIND OF AN EXCITING THING FOR US TO DO.
15,ep161,"WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 14 YEARS, AND WE'VE LIVED IN..."
16,ep161,THIS IS OUR TENTH PLACE TO LIVE.
17,ep161,"JUST LIVING IN THE SAME WHOLE HOUSE FOREVER JUST DOESN'T DO FOR US, SO WE LIKE THIS."
18,ep161,IT'S A CHALLENGE.
19,ep161,"(Suzanne) SO WHEN THE GREENS BECAME DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR CURRENT HOME, THEY DECIDED THE TIME WAS RIGHT TO START LOOKING FOR HOUSE NUMBER 11."
20,ep161,"WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A YARD, 'CAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A VERY SMALL PATIO, AND WE'D LIKE SOMETHING A LITTLE BIGGER, MAYBE WE COULD BARBECUE IN AND PLANT SOME FLOWERS, REALLY ENJOY."
21,ep161,MAYBE HAVE A LITTLE YIPPY DOG OR SOMETHING.
22,ep161,"(Suzanne) BESIDES LACKING A YARD, THIS TOWNHOUSE HAS A KITCHEN THAT IS JUST TOO SMALL FOR LINDA, WHO IS AN AVID COOK."
23,ep161,(Linda) THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THAT I LIKE ABOUT MY CURRENT KITCHEN.
24,ep161,"THE WAY IT'S LAID OUT IS REALLY NOT VERY PRACTICAL, AND MY STOVE IS OLD..."
25,ep161,MY REFRIGERATOR'S OLD.
26,ep161,IT'S NOT A FUN PLACE TO BE.
27,ep161,I DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING CREATIVE AND SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN THERE.
28,ep161,"AND I'D LIKE SOMETHING WITH MORE SPACE, SO I CAN MOVE AROUND IN, JUST KIND OF SET UP MY DREAM KITCHEN AND DO A LOT OF COOKING."
29,ep161,"ANOTHER REASON WE WANNA MOVE IS, BECAUSE I'M IN THE COMPUTER BUSINESS, AND I'VE GOT SOME IDEAS ABOUT AN ELECTRONIC HOME, AND SO I WANNA GET A HOUSE THAT'S NEWER WHERE I CAN WIRE IT AND BUILD IT FOR TECHNOLOGY."
30,ep161,THIS IS A CONDO...
31,ep161,"WE SHARE COMMON WALLS, AND I CAN'T GO THROUGH THE WALLS AND TEAR IT UP, LIKE I COULD IF I OWNED THE HOUSE OUTRIGHT."
32,ep161,"(Suzanne) SO IDEALLY, THE GREENS WANT A TOWNHOUSE WITH NO SHARED WALLS."
33,ep161,MICHAEL'S PASSION FOR COMPUTERS GIVES HIM ANOTHER REASON FOR WANTING A NEW HOME-- THE CHANCE TO HAVE A GREAT NEW HOME OFFICE.
34,ep161,THE ISSUE OF OFFICE SPACE BRINGS UP THE COUPLE'S ONLY DISAGREEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR NEW HOME.
35,ep161,"I WOULD LIKE THREE BEDROOMS, AND SHE WOULD LIKE JUST THE ONE."
36,ep161,I LIKE A BEDROOM...
37,ep161,"OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED AT LEAST TWO."
38,ep161,"ONE TO LIVE IN AND SLEEP IN, AND THE OTHER ONE WE NEED IS FOR MY OFFICE."
39,ep161,I CAN'T BE A COMPUTER JUNKIE WITHOUT A PLACE TO HOOK IN A COMPUTER.
40,ep161,"I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED A THIRD ONE, SO THAT WE CAN HAVE GUESTS AND PEOPLE STAY OVER."
41,ep161,I'M JUST NOT...
42,ep161,"I DON'T WANT A LOT OF EXTRA ROOMS TO CLEAN, A LOT OF ROOMS THAT AREN'T GONNA BE USED."
43,ep161,I HAVE SEEN SOME HOUSES THAT HAVE LIKE A FORMAL LIVING ROOM AND A FORMAL DINING ROOM.
44,ep161,"WELL, THOSE ARE SPACES THAT WE WOULDN'T USE, AND I WOULD HAVE TO CLEAN."
45,ep161,AND SO I'M NOT LOOKING FOR EXTRA BEDROOMS OR EXTRA AREAS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA USE.
46,ep161,(Suzanne) OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE GREENS ARE HAVING A LAUNDRY ROOM ON THE SAME FLOOR AS THE BEDROOMS AND HAVING A LARGE MASTER SUITE.
47,ep161,ROUNDING OUT THEIR LIST OF DESIRES FOR THEIR NEW HOME IS SOMETHING THEY DON'T HAVE HERE.
48,ep161,A NEWNESS.
49,ep161,"WE'VE LIVED IN OLD PLACES FOREVER, AND WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S NEW, THAT'S OURS."
50,ep161,WE WANNA BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO LIVE THERE.
51,ep161,IF WE CAN FIND THAT.
52,ep161,"YEAH, THAT'S A DREAM FOR US IS WE'VE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A NEW PLACE, SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN AFFORD AND THAT'S NEW."
53,ep161,THAT WOULD BE VERY EXCITING FOR US.
54,ep161,(Suzanne) BUT THIS IS ONE COUPLE WHOSE EXCITEMENT MIGHT JUST GET THEM IN TROUBLE.
55,ep161,"ONE OF THE DOWN SIDES OF BEING IMPULSIVE IS THAT WHILE WE'RE QUICK TO MAKE DECISIONS, SOMETIMES WE DON'T THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING."
56,ep161,"AND SO WHILE WE'VE LIVED IN TEN DIFFERENT PLACES, IN EACH INSTANCE WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING NEW THAT WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT BEFORE WE MOVED IN."
57,ep161,AN EXAMPLE IS THE KITCHEN.
58,ep161,WE'RE VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE KITCHEN HERE.
59,ep161,WE DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD BE DISSATISFIED WITH THE KITCHEN.
60,ep161,"WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS PRETTY COOL WAS ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS THAT WE LOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE, LIKE IT HAD A FIREPLACE IN THE BEDROOM."
61,ep161,AND NOW WE KNOW WE WANT A FIREPLACE IN THE BEDROOM AND A BIG KITCHEN.
62,ep161,(Suzanne) SO MICHAEL AND LINDA ARE READY TO EMBARK ON THEIR HOUSE HUNT WITH ONE MAJOR OBSTACLE STILL IN THE ROAD.
63,ep161,"BEFORE THE GREENS CAN BUY A NEW HOME, THEY MUST FIRST SELL THEIR OLD ONE."
64,ep161,"WELL, WE SEEM VERY EXCITED, BECAUSE THIS IS SORT OF A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR US."
65,ep161,"WE'VE NEVER REALLY SOLD A HOME AND THEN BOUGHT A HOME RIGHT AWAY, SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT."
66,ep161,AND WE'RE HOPING WE FIND SOMETHING A LITTLE NICER AND JUST A PLACE WE'LL BE REALLY EXCITED TO GO.
67,ep161,(Suzanne) MICHAEL AND LINDA HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR THEIR NEW HOME.
68,ep161,BUT CAN THIS IMPULSIVE COUPLE MAKE A QUICK DECISION AND A WISE DECISION AT THE SAME TIME?
69,ep161,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
70,ep161,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
71,ep161,LINDA AND MICHAEL GREEN HAVE LIVED IN TEN DIFFERENT HOMES SINCE THEY WERE MARRIED 14 YEARS AGO.
72,ep161,NOW A GROWING DISSATISFACTION WITH THEIR CURRENT PLACE HAS STARTED THEM ON THE HUNT FOR HOUSE NUMBER 11.
73,ep161,"THE ONE PART OF THEIR CURRENT HOME THE GREENS DEFINITELY WANT TO HOLD ON TO IS THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER REALTOR TEAM WHO FOUND IT FOR THEM, SO THE COUPLE IS STICKING WITH DONNA AND SHANNON FREEMAN."
74,ep161,"MICHAEL AND LINDA ARE REALLY EASY TO WORK WITH, ACTUALLY, 'CAUSE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT."
75,ep161,"RIGHT? THEY DO, AND THE GOOD THING IS SINCE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT, THEY CAN EASILY COMMUNICATE IT TO US, AND IT JUST..."
76,ep161,"IT MAKES OUR JOB REALLY EASY, AND THEY'RE SO MUCH FUN TO WORK WITH, REALLY."
77,ep161,"(Suzanne) WITH GROWING ENTHUSIASM, THE GROUP APPROACHES THEIR FIRST PROSPECTIVE HOME."
78,ep161,(Michael) SO HOW OLD IS IT?
79,ep161,"MICHAEL, THIS IS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD, ACTUALLY."
80,ep161,HOW BIG IS THE SQUARE FOOT?
81,ep161,TWENTY-ONE NINETY-SIX...
82,ep161,IT'S FOUR BEDROOMS.
83,ep161,OH! THIS IS NICE.
84,ep161,(Shannon) IT'S REALLY BRIGHT IN HERE...
85,ep161,IT'S NICE.
86,ep161,THIS IS GREAT.
87,ep161,(Linda) I LIKE THE DETAIL ON THE ARCHES.
88,ep161,AND THAT SPECTACULAR FIREPLACE RIGHT WHEN YOU WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR.
89,ep161,"OH, THAT'S GREAT."
90,ep161,LET'S SEE THE KITCHEN.
91,ep161,"OKAY. REALLY BRIGHT, TOO."
92,ep161,"OH, THIS IS BRIGHT..."
93,ep161,THIS IS NICE.
94,ep161,AND IT'S GOT A NICE LITTLE DINING AREA AND A BREAKFAST BAR.
95,ep161,"UH-OH, THE LAUNDRY ROOM'S ON THE FIRST FLOOR."
96,ep161,"OH, YOU GUYS HAD ASKED THAT IT BE UP BY THE BEDROOMS."
97,ep161,YEAH. WANTED TO HAVE IT UP BY THE BEDROOM.
98,ep161,IT HAS A GAS STOVE.
99,ep161,YOU WANTED THAT...
100,ep161,THAT'S NICE.
101,ep161,"YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
102,ep161,LET'S GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE THAT.
103,ep161,OKAY. I LIKE THIS.
104,ep161,"OH, I LIKE THIS BIG WINDOW HERE."
105,ep161,"YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY BIGHT."
106,ep161,"YEAH, THE FIRST LEVEL'S NICE..."
107,ep161,I LIKE THAT.
108,ep161,"(Suzanne) AFTER LIVING IN SO MANY DIFFERENT HOUSES, MICHAEL AND LINDA KNOW JUST WHAT THEY WANT, AND IT DOESN'T TAKE THEM VERY LONG TO DETERMINE WHETHER A HOME FITS THE BILL."
109,ep161,"AFTER DISCOVERING THAT THIS HOME LACKS A FIREPLACE IN THE MASTER BEDROOM, THE GREENS ARE READY TO MOVE ON."
110,ep161,"KNOWING MICHAEL AND LINDA AS WELL AS THEY DO, THEIR REALTORS DONNA AND SHANNON HAVE LINED UP A DOZEN HOMES FOR THE COUPLE TO SEE TODAY."
111,ep161,"THE FREEMANS ALSO KNOW THE GREENS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SELLING THEIR OLD HOME, SO SHANNON HEADS BACK TO THE OFFICE TO WORK ON THAT END OF THE PROCESS WHILE DONNA TAKES THE COUPLE TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE LISTING."
112,ep161,"(Donna) OH, THIS IS PRETTY FROM THE OUTSIDE..."
113,ep161,ISN'T IT?
114,ep161,(Michael) LOOK AT THE WEATHER VANE.
115,ep161,(Linda) NOW HOW OLD IS THIS?
116,ep161,IT WAS BUILT IN '88.
117,ep161,AND HOW BIG?
118,ep161,"IT HAS 2,100 SQUARE FEET."
119,ep161,AH! THAT CARPET IS REALLY BRIGHT.
120,ep161,"YEAH, IT IS."
121,ep161,IT HAS A WET BAR IN THE FORMAL LIVING ROOM.
122,ep161,THAT'S NICE.
123,ep161,"OH, YEAH..."
124,ep161,LOOK AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE GLASS.
125,ep161,AND LOOK...
126,ep161,I DO LIKE THE WINDOWS.
127,ep161,I THINK THE SHAPE IS KIND OF NEAT.
128,ep161,I'M KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT OUR FURNITURE.
129,ep161,"I THINK IT WOULD CLASH, AND IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE SMALL FOR IT."
130,ep161,THIS LIVING ROOM IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE AVERAGE.
131,ep161,(Suzanne) MICHAEL AND LINDA DISAGREE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THIS HOME PRESENTS.
132,ep161,SO THE GROUP HEADS UPSTAIRS TO LET THE MASTER BEDROOM SETTLE THE ISSUE.
133,ep161,"HMM. AT THE LADDER, THOUGH."
134,ep161,I WONDER WHERE THAT GOES?
135,ep161,WHAT'S UP THERE?
136,ep161,BONUS ROOM...
137,ep161,OH! IS SO COOL!
138,ep161,I DON'T THINK I WANT A LADDER IN MY MASTER BEDROOM.
139,ep161,WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WANT A LADDER IN YOUR MASTER BEDROOM?
140,ep161,THIS IS AWESOME!
141,ep161,(Suzanne) MICHAEL AND LINDA WILL JUST HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE ABOUT THAT ONE.
142,ep161,"BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, THE AGE OF THIS TOWNHOUSE, THE SIZE OF ITS LIVING ROOM AND THE COLOR OF THE CARPETS LEAD MICHAEL AND LINDA TO LIST THIS ONE IN THE NO COLUMN."
143,ep161,THE FINAL HOUSE ON TODAY'S LIST SHOWS GREAT POTENTIAL.
144,ep161,"IT'S BRAND-NEW, HAS A NICE-SIZED BACKYARD AND MEETS MANY OF THE GREENS' OTHER REQUIREMENTS."
145,ep161,OH! THIS IS LOVELY.
146,ep161,THIS IS.
147,ep161,"OH, CLEAN..."
148,ep161,PRETTY. IT REALLY IS CLEAN...
149,ep161,ISN'T IT?
150,ep161,"OH, YEAH..."
151,ep161,LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
152,ep161,"(Suzanne) MICHAEL, LINDA AND DONNA DECIDE TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER DISCOVERING ON THEIR OWN THE HOME'S SPACIOUS KITCHEN..."
153,ep161,LOVELY BACKYARD...
154,ep161,AND THE MASTER BEDROOM COMPLETE WITH FIREPLACE.
155,ep161,BUT MICHAEL ISN'T CRAZY ABOUT THE LAYOUT OF THE MASTER BATH.
156,ep161,"THE SPARE BEDROOM ISN'T AS LARGE AS THEY'D LIKE, AND THE FORMAL DINING ROOM IS NOT A SPACE THEY WOULD USE."
157,ep161,SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK?
158,ep161,IT'S REALLY NICE.
159,ep161,"I LIKED IT, BUT..."
160,ep161,I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL...
161,ep161,"YEAH. WAS A LOT OF WASTED SPACE, FORMAL..."
162,ep161,TWO FORMAL ROOMS.
163,ep161,MORE THAN FOR YOUR LIFESTYLE.
164,ep161,YEAH. AGREE WITH YOU.
165,ep161,"I LIKE IT, BUT I DON'T LOVE IT."
166,ep161,"UH-HUH. NOT THE ONE, HUH?"
167,ep161,LET'S KEEP LOOKING.
168,ep161,OKAY. THE GREENS ARE QUICK TO DECIDE WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T LIKE.
169,ep161,"COMING UP NEXT, WE'LL SEE IF THEIR IMPULSIVENESS GETS THEM IN TROUBLE."
170,ep161,AND A JACUZZI TUB!
171,ep161,"OH, MY GOODNESS!"
172,ep161,(Suzanne) STAY TUNED.
173,ep161,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS...
174,ep161,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
175,ep161,"MICHAEL AND LINDA GREEN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEIR NEW HOME SHOULD HAVE, AND THEY'RE QUICK TO MOVE ON WHEN THEY DON'T FIND IT."
176,ep161,"ALONG WITH THEIR REALTORS SHANNON AND DONNA FREEMAN, THIS IMPULSIVE COUPLE COVERED A DOZEN HOMES IN THEIR FIRST DAY OF HOUSE HUNTING, BUT DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT STRUCK THEIR FANCY."
177,ep161,I DON'T THINK I WANT A LADDER IN MY MASTER BEDROOM.
178,ep161,"(Suzanne) AFTER SHOWING THE GREENS NEARLY EVERYTHING AVAILABLE IN THEIR PRICE RANGE, DONNA AND SHANNON HAVE COME ACROSS A PROMISING NEW FIND."
179,ep161,"SO PROMISING, IN FACT, THAT THEY'VE ASKED LINDA TO SEE IT EVEN BEFORE MICHAEL GETS HOME FROM WORK."
180,ep161,"THE HOME IS PRICED SLIGHTLY OUT OF THEIR RANGE, BUT IT HAS EVERYTHING THEY WANT."
181,ep161,MM. THIS IS NICE.
182,ep161,(Shannon) THIS IS REALLY PRETTY.
183,ep161,"YEAH... SIZE, AND I LIKE THAT DETAIL."
184,ep161,THAT IS REALLY NICE.
185,ep161,"LINDA, LOOK AT THE FIREPLACE."
186,ep161,MM-HMM. THAT'D BE GREAT.
187,ep161,"OH, IT'S PRETTY."
188,ep161,VERY PRETTY...
189,ep161,VERY WELL DONE.
190,ep161,"YEAH, IT IS."
191,ep161,"OOH, I'D LOVE TO SEE THE KITCHEN."
192,ep161,THE KITCHEN'S THIS WAY...
193,ep161,LET'S GO SEE THE KITCHEN.
194,ep161,"OH, LINDA, THIS IS SO NICE!"
195,ep161,IT'S HUGE!
196,ep161,THIS IS GREAT.
197,ep161,THIS IS WHAT I CALL A KITCHEN.
198,ep161,THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
199,ep161,LOOK AT THE CABINETS.
200,ep161,REALLY NICE.
201,ep161,"(Suzanne) SO FAR, SO GOOD."
202,ep161,"THE HOUSE IS BRAND-NEW WITH AN AMAZING KITCHEN THAT LINDA LOVES, AND SHANNON THINKS SHE'LL FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE BACKYARD."
203,ep161,"OOH... WOW, THIS IS A GREAT SIZE!"
204,ep161,THIS IS GREAT.
205,ep161,"IT'S VERY PRIVATE, TOO."
206,ep161,"(Linda) IT'S NOT TOO BIG, SO IT'S NOT A LOT OF MOWING."
207,ep161,"I LIKE IT SO FAR, SO LET'S GO SEE THE UPSTAIRS."
208,ep161,YOU WANNA SEE IT...
209,ep161,"I DO, TOO."
210,ep161,"(Suzanne) THE BACKYARD PIQUES LINDA'S INTEREST, BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME."
211,ep161,HOLY MOLY...
212,ep161,"OH, LINDA, LOOK!"
213,ep161,I THINK IT'S THE MASTER BEDROOM.
214,ep161,"(Donna) OH, MY GOSH, IT'S HUGE!"
215,ep161,A FIREPLACE!
216,ep161,"OH, THAT'S PERFECT."
217,ep161,IT IS.
218,ep161,LOOKIT... A SITTING AREA.
219,ep161,YOU COULD PUT A LITTLE COUCH OR A LITTLE TV.
220,ep161,"AND LOOK AT THE CEILING, THE DETAIL."
221,ep161,"HE DID THE DETAIL AGAIN, THE BUILDER, AND THE DETAIL AROUND THE WINDOWS."
222,ep161,THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
223,ep161,"OH, LINDA, I LOVE THIS."
224,ep161,I HAVE TO CALL MICHAEL...
225,ep161,HE HAS TO COME SEE THIS.
226,ep161,"LINDA, WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE MASTER BATH YET."
227,ep161,"OH, ALL RIGHT."
228,ep161,"(Suzanne) FOR LINDA, THE MASTER BATH SEALS THE DEAL."
229,ep161,THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!
230,ep161,"OH, MY GOSH, MICHAEL, THIS PLACE IS SO GREAT."
231,ep161,YOU HAVE GOT TO COME SEE IT.
232,ep161,"(Suzanne) IF MICHAEL IS HALF AS EXCITED AS LINDA IS, DONNA AND SHANNON CAN PUT THE REST OF THEIR LISTINGS AWAY."
233,ep161,BYE-BYE. DID HE SAY?
234,ep161,HE SAID HE'S COMING RIGHT OVER.
235,ep161,"OH, GOOD..."
236,ep161,THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
237,ep161,HE'S GONNA LOVE THIS PLACE.
238,ep161,(Suzanne) ANOTHER BENEFIT TO THIS TOWNHOUSE IS ITS PROXIMITY TO MICHAEL'S JOB.
239,ep161,HE ARRIVES AT THE HOUSE JUST MINUTES LATER.
240,ep161,HEY! YOU GOT HERE FAST.
241,ep161,YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE THIS.
242,ep161,IT LOOKS GREAT.
243,ep161,IT LOOKS GREAT...
244,ep161,IT'S BRAND-NEW.
245,ep161,DID YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE LEAVING WORK?
246,ep161,NO... HAVE A COOL BOSS.
247,ep161,HERE WE ARE.
248,ep161,"OH, THIS IS GREAT."
249,ep161,"OH, MAN!"
250,ep161,"MICHAEL, ISN'T THIS GREAT?"
251,ep161,IT'S REALLY BIG.
252,ep161,"OH, LOOK AT THE FIREPLACE."
253,ep161,"OH, THIS IS A HUGE LIVING ROOM."
254,ep161,"WELL, I WANT YOU TO SEE THE KITCHEN NEXT."
255,ep161,"OH, YEAH."
256,ep161,OKAY. AT THIS KITCHEN.
257,ep161,IT'S SO BIG!
258,ep161,"OH, WOW!"
259,ep161,ISN'T THIS UNBELIEVABLE?
260,ep161,YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN COOKING IN HERE.
261,ep161,MICHAEL IS.
262,ep161,YOU'RE GONNA LEARN TO COOK...
263,ep161,"RIGHT, BABE?"
264,ep161,SURE... LEARN TO COOK IN HERE.
265,ep161,(Suzanne) THIS KITCHEN HAS SO MUCH TO OFFER.
266,ep161,MICHAEL CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE UPSTAIRS.
267,ep161,SO LINDA TAKES CHARGE OF THE REST OF THE TOUR.
268,ep161,"LAUNDRY ROOM, UPSTAIRS."
269,ep161,"OH, WOW..."
270,ep161,THAT'S GREAT.
271,ep161,(Suzanne) SCORE TWO POINTS FOR THE UPSTAIRS LAUNDRY ROOM.
272,ep161,MY OFFICE.
273,ep161,UH-HUH. OFFICE.
274,ep161,"OH, THAT'S NICE."
275,ep161,AND GUEST BEDROOM.
276,ep161,"OH, I LIKE THIS..."
277,ep161,THIS IS GREAT.
278,ep161,"OKAY, MORE TO SEE."
279,ep161,AND THE MASTER BEDROOM.
280,ep161,FIREPLACE... THIS IS GREAT!
281,ep161,THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
282,ep161,MM-HMM. WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE BATHROOM.
283,ep161,AND A JACUZZI TUB!
284,ep161,THIS IS GORGEOUS.
285,ep161,THIS IS EVERYTHING WE WANTED.
286,ep161,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
287,ep161,"WELL, IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH, BUT IT'S GOT EVERYTHING WE WANT."
288,ep161,"IT'S A STAND- ALONE HOUSE, IT'S GOT A BACKYARD..."
289,ep161,IT'S GOT THE...
290,ep161,FIREPLACE IN THE BEDROOM.
291,ep161,THE FIREPLACE.
292,ep161,IT'S GOT THE...
293,ep161,LAUNDRY UPSTAIRS.
294,ep161,AND THE KITCHEN DOWN BY THE...
295,ep161,HUGE KITCHEN.
296,ep161,WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE?
297,ep161,"IT'S... A LITTLE HIGH, BUT..."
298,ep161,I THINK...
299,ep161,I THINK WE CAN DO IT.
300,ep161,"REALLY? MICHAEL, TOO, IS SOLD ON THE HOUSE, AND JUST LIKE THAT, THE COUPLE DECIDES TO PUT IN AN OFFER ON THE SPOT."
301,ep161,"(Donna) OKAY, YOU GUYS, THIS IS IT."
302,ep161,"OKAY, YOU ARE OLD HAT AT THIS."
303,ep161,YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS...
304,ep161,WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.
305,ep161,"(Suzanne) BEING EXPERIENCED HOME BUYERS TAKES SOME OF THE WORRY OUT OF THE PROCESS, BUT NOT ALL OF IT."
306,ep161,"THIS HOUSE IS PRICED ABOVE WHAT THE GREENS HAD DECIDED TO SPEND, SO THEY'LL HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FROM THEIR LENDER FOR A LARGER LOAN."
307,ep161,"OH, AND THERE'S ONE MORE THING."
308,ep161,"MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS HOW ARE WE GONNA GET ME OUT OF THE OTHER HOUSE AND INTO THIS ONE AT THE SAME TIME, SO I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN A HOTEL OR SOMETHING?"
309,ep161,"THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOR, AND WE'LL COORDINATE THAT FOR YOU."
310,ep161,"OKAY. HOPEFUL THAT EVERYTHING WILL COME TOGETHER, THE GREENS SIT BACK AND WAIT."
311,ep161,"MICHAEL AND LINDA HAVE FOUND A HOME THAT SEEMS TO HAVE IT ALL, BUT IT WON'T BE THEIRS, IF THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR OLD HOME FIRST."
312,ep161,WILL THEY DO IT?
313,ep161,FIND OUT NEXT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS CONTINUES.
314,ep161,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
315,ep161,"AFTER A WHIRLWIND SEARCH, LINDA AND MICHAEL GREEN HAVE MADE AN OFFER ON WHAT MAY BE THEIR PERFECT HOUSE."
316,ep161,THE GREENS HAVE GOTTEN TWO PIECES OF GOOD NEWS ALREADY.
317,ep161,"THEIR LENDER WILL APPROVE THEM FOR THE HIGHER LOAN AMOUNT REQUIRED TO PURCHASE THE HOME, AND JUST 24 HOURS AFTER MAKING AN OFFER ON A NEW HOME, THE GREENS ACCEPTED AN OFFER ON THEIR OLD HOME."
318,ep161,NOW THEY'RE WAITING FOR THEIR REALTORS DONNA AND SHANNON FREEMAN TO DELIVER ONE MORE PIECE OF NEWS.
319,ep161,WILL THEIR OFFER ON THE NEW HOME BE ACCEPTED?
320,ep161,"(phone ringing) HELLO, THIS IS MICHAEL."
321,ep161,"Hey, Michael, it's Shannon."
322,ep161,I'M JUST COMING FROM ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.
323,ep161,"I'M SITTING ON THE HOOD OF MY CAR, AND I'M CALLING TO GIVE YOU GOOD NEWS."
324,ep161,Really? do you got?
325,ep161,THE OFFER THAT YOU MADE ON YOUR NEW HOUSE WAS ACCEPTED.
326,ep161,THEY ACCEPTED OUR OFFER?
327,ep161,Yeah. A MINUTE...
328,ep161,"WHEN DONNA SAYS STUFF COMES TOGETHER, I DIDN'T REALIZE SHE MEANT THIS FAST."
329,ep161,"(Suzanne) IN LESS THAN A WEEK, THE GREENS' PLAN HAS COME TOGETHER, AND THE NEWS IS ALL GOOD FOR MICHAEL AND LINDA."
330,ep161,"HEY, LINDA, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS!"
331,ep161,(Suzanne) IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE NEWS TO SETTLE IN OR FOR THE GREENS TO SETTLE IN.
332,ep161,"JUST A MONTH AND A HALF LATER, THEY'RE HAPPY TO BE HOME."
333,ep161,WE LOVE OUR NEW HOME.
334,ep161,IT'S AWESOME...
335,ep161,YEAH. OUR DREAM HOUSE.
336,ep161,NICEST PLACE.
337,ep161,YEAH... OUR DREAM HOUSE.
338,ep161,IT'S A BRAND-NEW HOUSE.
339,ep161,THERE'S NOTHING IN IT THAT'S OLD EXCEPT...
340,ep161,US... OLD.
341,ep161,WE'RE OLD.
342,ep161,BUT IT'S PERFECT.
343,ep161,(Suzanne) THE COUPLE TRADED IN THEIR TINY PATIO FOR A REAL BACKYARD THEY NOW USE OFTEN.
344,ep161,(Michael) IT LOOKS REALLY NICE...
345,ep161,WE'RE VERY HAPPY.
346,ep161,WE BOUGHT A BARBECUE.
347,ep161,"OH, YEAH..."
348,ep161,"WE PUT A BARBECUE BACK THERE, SO WE FINALLY GOT THAT TAKEN CARE OF."
349,ep161,"(Suzanne) AND MICHAEL GOT THE GUEST BEDROOM HE WANTED, WHICH LINDA AGREES IS A NICE SPACE TO HAVE."
350,ep161,"IN THE END, THE GREENS FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOT IT ALL."
351,ep161,IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE WIRE THE HOUSE FOR COMPUTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
352,ep161,"AND THE BUILDER USED A HIGH-GRADE QUALITY WIRE FOR THE TELEPHONES, AND I WAS ABLE TO TAP OFF OF THAT AND HOOK UP ALL MY COMPUTERS, SO NOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOOK UP COMPUTERS EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE TO THE INTERNET."
353,ep161,SO THAT'S A REAL STROKE.
354,ep161,WE'RE REAL HAPPY WITH THAT.
355,ep161,"(Suzanne) NOW EVEN LINDA'S KITCHEN IS WIRED, AN ADDED BONUS IN A ROOM THAT ALREADY SEEMED IDEAL."
356,ep161,(Linda) I LOVE THE KITCHEN.
357,ep161,"FIRST OF ALL, IT IS SO BIG."
358,ep161,"IT IS REALLY NICE, BECAUSE I CAN PLUG IN THE COMPUTER, AND I HAVE ACCESS TO MY RECIPES AND FILES, AND SO THAT BRINGS ANOTHER ASPECT TO KITCHEN LIFE."
359,ep161,AND IT'S BECOME A MORE SENSUAL AREA THAN IT EVER WAS BEFORE.
360,ep161,"MICHAEL'S BEEN IN THE KITCHEN WITH ME WHEN I'M COOKING, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, AND HE'S DONE MORE DISHES SINCE WE MOVED IN THAN THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE MARRIED, SO I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT."
361,ep161,IT'S A BRAND-NEW HOUSE.
362,ep161,YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IT CLEAN NOW.
363,ep161,IT'S GOTTA BE BRAND- NEW FOR A LONG TIME.
364,ep161,"WELCOME TO (Suzanne) NOT ONLY IS THIS HOUSE BRAND-NEW, IT HAS A BRIGHT AND AIRY FEEL THE COUPLE LOVES, ESPECIALLY IN THE MASTER BEDROOM."
365,ep161,"IN FACT, THERE ISN'T A SPOT ON THIS HOUSE THE COUPLE DOESN'T LOVE NOW THAT THEY'RE HERE."
366,ep161,BUT GETTING TO THIS POINT WASN'T AS EASY AS THEY ONCE THOUGHT.
367,ep161,"OVERALL, THE EXPERIENCE WAS ABOUT 100% MORE STRESSFUL THAN WE EXPECTED IT TO BE."
368,ep161,"OH, YEAH."
369,ep161,IT WAS NOTHING LIKE BUYING YOUR FIRST HOUSE.
370,ep161,"YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT, YOU CAN EXTEND THE LEASE FOR ANOTHER 10, 15 DAYS, AND TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOU NEED TO MOVE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE."
371,ep161,"AND HERE IT WAS, YOU'VE GOTTA BE OUT BY EIGHT A.M."
372,ep161,"IN THIS HOUSE, AND YOU CAN'T MOVE INTO THE OTHER HOUSE UNTIL EIGHT A.M."
373,ep161,"THE NEXT DAY, 'CAUSE THEY CAN'T CLOSE ON THE SAME DAY."
374,ep161,"OH, THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT OF HEADACHE THERE THAT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH."
375,ep161,BUT THAT ALL CAME TOGETHER.
376,ep161,"WHEN WE FOUND THIS PLACE, WHEN LINDA FIRST FOUND IT, AND THEN WHEN I SAW IT, IT WAS OVER..."
377,ep161,WE KNEW.
378,ep161,"JUST OUR SAME IMPULSIVE THING, ONLY WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT, AND WE'RE VERY COMFORTABLE, VERY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT'S WORKING."
379,ep161,THERE'S NOTHING WE WOULD CHANGE ABOUT THIS HOUSE.
380,ep161,THE GREENS' SPONTANEITY AND THEIR PRACTICALITY WORKED TOGETHER AS THEY FOUND A HOUSE THAT REALLY WORKS AND FOUND IT FAST.
381,ep161,THEIR TIMING WAS IMPECCABLE AND SO IS THEIR NEW HOME.
382,ep161,I'M SUZANNE WHANG...
383,ep161,THANKS FOR WATCHING.

1,ep162,SUZANNE WHANG...
2,ep162,WELCOME TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
3,ep162,MARCIE AND DAN POWERS WANT TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM OF OWNING THEIR OWN HOME.
4,ep162,"TIRED OF RENTING, THE COUPLE AND THEIR DAUGHTER ALLISON AND ANXIOUS TO SETTLE DOWN AND PLANT SOME ROOTS, BUT THEIR BUDGET IS TIGHT, AND THEY MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF THE ITEMS ON THEIR WISH LIST."
5,ep162,"NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS, FIND OUT JUST HOW CLOSE THE POWERS COME TO FINDING THEIR DREAM HOUSE."
6,ep162,♪♪ MARCIE AND DAN POWERS HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD AND SAVING FOR A HOUSE FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
7,ep162,"WITH INTEREST RATES DOWN, THE COUPLE AND THEIR FOUR- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER ALLISON ARE READY TO LEAVE TENANT LIFE BEHIND AND TAKE THE PLUNGE INTO HOMEOWNERSHIP."
8,ep162,CURRENTLY WE'RE RENTING A HOUSE.
9,ep162,"WE'VE BEEN RENTING HERE FOR FOUR YEARS, AND AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN OUT OF MY PARENTS' HOUSE, I'VE BEEN RENTING."
10,ep162,SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS TIME THAT WE GOT A PLACE OF OUR OWN.
11,ep162,"WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR PROBABLY CLOSE TO TWO YEARS NOW, OFF AND ON."
12,ep162,... HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE RIGHT HOUSE.
13,ep162,"(Suzanne) WHEN THE POWERS MOVED INTO THEIR CURRENT HOME, THEIR DAUGHTER ALLISON WAS A NEWBORN, AND THE HOUSE FIT THEM FINE."
14,ep162,"BUT OVER THE YEARS, THEY HAVE GRADUALLY OUTGROWN IT."
15,ep162,(Dan) ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A NEW HOME IS TO MOVE UP IN SIZE.
16,ep162,"THIS HAS BEEN A NICE SIZE FOR US, BUT OUR DAUGHTER'S GETTING BIGGER, AND WE'VE JUST GOT MORE STUFF, AND WE NEED A PLACE FOR IT, SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BIGGER, DEFINITELY."
17,ep162,"HEY, SWEETIE, CAN I HELP YA?"
18,ep162,"HI, HONEY."
19,ep162,"OH, PLEASE, WOULD YOU DRY THE DISHES FOR ME?"
20,ep162,SURE. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR A DISHWASHER IN THE HOME.
21,ep162,WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE FOR FOUR YEARS.
22,ep162,"WE MOVED IN HERE WITH AN INFANT, AND I WAS STERILIZING ALL THE BOTTLES."
23,ep162,"SO THE NEXT ONE, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A DISHWASHER TO WASH THEM IN."
24,ep162,(Dan) THE WHOLE KITCHEN IN GENERAL...
25,ep162,"I LIKE TO COOK, AND THE KITCHEN HERE IS FAIRLY SMALL, SO LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAT I CAN MOVE AROUND IN."
26,ep162,(Suzanne) ANOTHER CONSIDERATION FOR THE POWERS IS THEIR FURNITURE.
27,ep162,(Marcie) ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A HOME IS SOMEWHERE FOR MY DINING ROOM SET.
28,ep162,(Dan) WE ALSO HAVE A LARGE LIVING ROOM SET THAT DOESN'T FIT QUITE RIGHT.
29,ep162,"IT'S A SECTIONAL THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ALL GO TOGETHER, AND WE'VE GOTTA BREAK IT UP AND PUT IT ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE ROOM, BECAUSE THERE'S NO TWO WALLS BIG ENOUGH TO RUN THE WHOLE THING ALL THE WAY AROUND."
30,ep162,"SO A BIG LIVING ROOM, BIGGER DINING ROOM WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO US."
31,ep162,"(Suzanne) WITH TWO DOGS, A BACKYARD IS IMPORTANT TO THE POWERS, A LARGER ONE THAT PROVIDES MORE VERSATILITY WOULD BE EVEN NICER."
32,ep162,(Marcie) ONE THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT THE HOUSE IS THAT IT HAS A VERY BIG SLIDING GLASS DOOR OUT TO OUR BACKYARD WHERE WE HAVE A BIG COVERED PATIO FOR THE DOGS.
33,ep162,(Dan) WE'RE HOPING TO FIND A PLACE WITH A BIGGER BACKYARD.
34,ep162,SOMEPLACE WHERE WE CAN MAKE A DOG RUN.
35,ep162,"YOU KNOW, IT'S FUN TO GO OUT AND PLAY WITH THE DOGS, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THEIR OWN SPACE, SO THAT WE COULD HAVE OUR OWN SPACE WITH PEOPLE COMING OVER AND NOT BEING ATTACKED BY THE ANIMALS."
36,ep162,"(Suzanne) FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE INSIDE, TO POWERS ARE EAGER TO ADORN A HOUSE OF THEIR OWN."
37,ep162,(Marcie) ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DAN AND I WANNA DO IS LANDSCAPE OUR OWN YARD.
38,ep162,"WE CAN'T REALLY DO IT HERE, SINCE IT'S NOT OUR PROPERTY."
39,ep162,(Dan) IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO DECORATE THE HOUSE THE WAY WE WANT IT.
40,ep162,"THERE'S NOTHING REALLY WRONG WITH THE WAY THIS HOUSE IS, AND IT'S JUST ALL THE WALLS ARE WHITE, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS WHEN WE CAME, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE TO BE WHEN WE LEFT."
41,ep162,AND WE JUST DON'T WANNA HAVE TO PUT THE TIME AND EFFORT INTO MAKING CHANGES THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE BACK LATER.
42,ep162,(Suzanne) MARCIE AND DAN PLAN TO PUT PLENTY OF TIME AND EFFORT INTO FINDING THE RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEY WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE RAISING THEIR DAUGHTER.
43,ep162,"(Marcie) WE'D LIKE A NICE, QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD."
44,ep162,WE DON'T WANT A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN THE STREET.
45,ep162,(Dan) WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN AREA WITH A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM.
46,ep162,"WE HAVE A FOUR-YEAR-OLD WHO'S GONNA BE STARTING SCHOOL SOON, AND WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE SHE'S GOING TO SCHOOL."
47,ep162,WE WANT HER TO HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION.
48,ep162,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
49,ep162,"(Suzanne) SO FAR, THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME HAS BEEN BOTH EDUCATIONAL AND EXHAUSTING FOR THE POWERS."
50,ep162,I DON'T LIKE THE AREA.
51,ep162,"(Suzanne) SINCE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST HOME THE COUPLE WILL OWN, THEY'VE BEEN TAKING THEIR TIME LOOKING AND LEARNING ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE MARKET AND THE CHALLENGES THEY WILL SOON FACE."
52,ep162,"WELL, LOOK..."
53,ep162,HERE'S ONE IN OUR PRICE RANGE.
54,ep162,YEAH... DON'T KNOW.
55,ep162,IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MANY BATHROOMS IT HAS.
56,ep162,"IT SAYS, THREE BEDROOMS, BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY BATHROOMS."
57,ep162,"A LOT OF TIMES THAT MEANS IT ONLY HAS ONE, AND THEY DON'T REALLY WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT RIGHT UP FRONT."
58,ep162,THAT'S TRUE.
59,ep162,(Dan) I THINK PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN FINDING THE HOME THAT WE REALLY WOULD LIKE IS GONNA BE OUR BUDGET.
60,ep162,"IN LOOKING TO GET INTO THE AREAS THAT WE PREFER, HOME PRICES ARE JUST HIGHER."
61,ep162,"(Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, MARCIE AND DAN HEAD OUT ON THEIR OWN IN SEARCH OF THEIR FIRST HOME."
62,ep162,ARE THEY PREPARED TO FACE THE UNCERTAINTY THAT LIES AHEAD?
63,ep162,STAY TUNED.
64,ep162,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
65,ep162,MARCIE AND DAN POWERS WOULD LIKE MORE THAN ANYTHING TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS.
66,ep162,"AFTER RENTING FOR FOUR YEARS, THE COUPLE AND THEIR FOUR- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER ALLISON HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR SPACE."
67,ep162,"BUT RATHER THAN TAKING THE USUAL FIRST STEP OF HIRING A REALTOR, THE POWERS HAVE BEGUN HOUSE HUNTING ON THEIR OWN."
68,ep162,"AFTER REVIEWING LISTINGS IN THE NEWSPAPER THE COUPLE BEGINS THE ARDUOUS TASK OF DRIVING AROUND THE CITY WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE, CHECKING OUT NEIGHBORHOODS AND HUNTING FOR OPEN HOUSES TO VIEW."
69,ep162,"YEP, THIS IS IT."
70,ep162,"OKAY, LET'S GO."
71,ep162,IT LOOKS NICE...
72,ep162,NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.
73,ep162,YEAH... MARCIE AND DAN QUICKLY FIND AN OPEN HOUSE WORTH TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT.
74,ep162,HI. ARE YOU?
75,ep162,GOOD... ON IN.
76,ep162,THANKS. YOU.
77,ep162,NICE BEAMS.
78,ep162,"YEAH, I LIKE THE OPEN BEAMS IN THE CEILING LIKE THAT."
79,ep162,"IT'S A NICE HIGH CEILING, TOO..."
80,ep162,I LIKE THAT.
81,ep162,"THIS IS A THREE-BEDROOM, TWO-BATH HOUSE."
82,ep162,"AND IT'S ABOUT 1,800 SQUARE FEET."
83,ep162,"IF THERE IS ANY QUESTIONS, LET ME KNOW, BUT FEEL FREE TO JUST TAKE A LOOK AROUND."
84,ep162,OKAY. SECTIONAL WOULD GO GOOD RIGHT IN THE CORNER THERE.
85,ep162,"OH, YEAH..."
86,ep162,IT WOULD.
87,ep162,TAKE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN?
88,ep162,YEAH. THE KITCHEN LOOKS NICE.
89,ep162,I LIKE THE GARDEN WINDOW.
90,ep162,YEAH... BIG.
91,ep162,"ALTHOUGH, I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GONNA BE ANY ROOM FOR OUR DINING ROOM TABLE IN HERE."
92,ep162,I DON'T SEE A PLACE FOR THE HUTCH.
93,ep162,THERE'S NO CORNER.
94,ep162,MM-MM. LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE.
95,ep162,OKAY. BACKYARD.
96,ep162,"YEAH, IT IS NICE."
97,ep162,IT'S GOT NICE LANDSCAPING AND STUFF.
98,ep162,"I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REALLY GONNA BE BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO DOGS, THOUGH, AND ALLISON."
99,ep162,"OKAY. WITHOUT A BIG ENOUGH YARD OR DINING AREA, DAN AND MARCIE AGREE TO CROSS THIS HOME OFF THEIR LIST AND MOVE ON TO FIND THE NEXT OPEN HOUSE."
100,ep162,THIS IS KIND OF NICE.
101,ep162,I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE.
102,ep162,"YEAH... LIKE THE AREA, THOUGH."
103,ep162,YEAH. A NICE AREA...
104,ep162,IT REALLY IS.
105,ep162,"AND YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY, WE CAN FIND SOMETHING NICE IN THIS AREA THAT WE CAN AFFORD."
106,ep162,HI. ARE YOU?
107,ep162,FINE. ARE YOU DOING?
108,ep162,COME ON IN.
109,ep162,HI... HERB.
110,ep162,"HERB, NICE TO MEET YOU."
111,ep162,I'M DAN.
112,ep162,"HI, DAN."
113,ep162,THAT'S MARCIE.
114,ep162,HI. MARCIE...
115,ep162,HOW ARE YOU?
116,ep162,FINE. HERE'S OUR HOUSE.
117,ep162,ALL RIGHT...
118,ep162,IT'S VERY NICE.
119,ep162,"I LIKE THE BIG WINDOWS LIKE THAT, TOO."
120,ep162,THEY LET IN A LOT OF LIGHT.
121,ep162,DINING ROOM OVER HERE.
122,ep162,"YEAH. NICE DINING ROOM, HONEY."
123,ep162,"YEAH, IT IS NICE."
124,ep162,"I LIKE THE LIGHT, THE WINDOWS AND STUFF."
125,ep162,I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL FOR OUR DINING ROOM TABLE.
126,ep162,"WELL, IT'S GOT THE CORNERS FOR THE HUTCH."
127,ep162,"YEAH, THAT'S TRUE."
128,ep162,HAVEN'T FOUND MANY PLACES LIKE THAT.
129,ep162,NO. YOU.
130,ep162,THANKS A LOT.
131,ep162,"(Suzanne) THIS HOUSE COSTS MUCH MORE THAN DAN AND MARCIE WANT TO SPEND, BUT IT DOES OPEN THEIR EYES TO THE MARKET IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THEY PREFER."
132,ep162,THERE'S THOUSANDS OF HOUSES FOR SALE.
133,ep162,WE GOTTA BE ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT FITS AT LEAST CLOSER TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN.
134,ep162,"OH, I KNOW."
135,ep162,THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE.
136,ep162,"THIS IS A NICE AREA, THOUGH."
137,ep162,"(Suzanne) FRUSTRATED WITH THEIR FINDINGS, THE POWERS CALL IT A DAY."
138,ep162,"AFTER TAKING NEARLY A WEEK OFF, DAN AND MARCIE ALONG WITH THEIR DAUGHTER ALLISON READILY HIT THE ROAD HOPING TO FIND A NEW HOME."
139,ep162,AN OPEN HOUSE SIGN SOON GRABS THEIR ATTENTION.
140,ep162,THIS HOUSE IS AN OLDER CRAFTSMAN-STYLE HOME QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE TRACT HOUSES THAT THE POWERS HAVE BEEN SEEING.
141,ep162,HI. ARE YA?
142,ep162,FINE. HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE TODAY?
143,ep162,"YES, WE ARE."
144,ep162,GO RIGHT AHEAD.
145,ep162,THANK YOU.
146,ep162,THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
147,ep162,YOU'RE WELCOME.
148,ep162,"WOW, THIS IS NICE, HONEY."
149,ep162,"YEAH, THIS IS REAL NICE."
150,ep162,I LIKE IT A LOT.
151,ep162,IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARACTER TO IT AND EVERYTHING.
152,ep162,"YEAH. WANNA GO LOOK IN THE BACKYARD, PUNKIN' YEAH."
153,ep162,"OKAY, YOU GO LOOK IN THE BACKYARD, BUT BE CAREFUL."
154,ep162,OKAY. YOU.
155,ep162,"I LIKE THE HARDWOOD FLOORS, TOO."
156,ep162,"OH, YEAH."
157,ep162,"THE DINING ROOM, THOUGH..."
158,ep162,"I MEAN, IT'S NICE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE SMALL FOR OUR DINING ROOM SET AND EVERYTHING."
159,ep162,YEAH... HAVE TO DO SOME MEASURING.
160,ep162,YEAH. LET'S GO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE ROOMS.
161,ep162,"OKAY. WOW, THIS IS NICE."
162,ep162,"YEAH, I LIKE THIS."
163,ep162,"(Suzanne) THIS BEDROOM IS CHARMING, BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOO COZY FOR ALL THE POWERS' THINGS."
164,ep162,THE KITCHEN IS ALSO SMALL AND NARROW.
165,ep162,"AND TO COMPLICATE MATTERS, THERE'S ONLY ONE BATHROOM."
166,ep162,"ALLISON SEEMS TO APPROVE OF THE BACKYARD, AND IT IS SPACIOUS."
167,ep162,"ALLISON, COME ON..."
168,ep162,IT'S TIME TO GO!
169,ep162,(Suzanne) BUT THE POWERS NEED MORE ROOM ON THE INSIDE THAN THIS HOME OFFERS.
170,ep162,"WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
171,ep162,YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
172,ep162,IT'S A GREAT HOUSE.
173,ep162,THANK YOU.
174,ep162,THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
175,ep162,THANK YOU.
176,ep162,"UH-HUH, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME."
177,ep162,"BYE-BYE. AFTER SEEING THIS HOUSE, THE POWERS ARE NOW SET ON FINDING AN OLDER CHARACTER HOME, BUT WITH ANOTHER COUPLE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET."
178,ep162,"HOWEVER, IN AN AREA KNOWN FOR HAVING LOTS OF TRACT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME."
179,ep162,"NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS, THE POWERS' PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT."
180,ep162,WILL THEY FIND WHAT THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR OR END UP SETTLING FOR LESS?
181,ep162,SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE RETURN.
182,ep162,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS...
183,ep162,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
184,ep162,DAN AND MARCIE POWERS HAVE A SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE WISH LIST.
185,ep162,THEY WANT A LARGE HOME WITH LOTS OF CHARACTER IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
186,ep162,BUT SO FAR ALL THE HOMES THAT FIT THE BILL ARE WAY OUT OF THE COUPLE'S PRICE RANGE.
187,ep162,DAN AND MARCIE ARE ON THE VERGE OF COMPROMISING WHAT THEY WANT WHEN A COWORKER OF MARCIE'S GIVES THEM A LEAD ON AN OLDER HOME IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
188,ep162,THE HOUSE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF BEING RENOVATED BEFORE IT'S PUT ON THE MARKET.
189,ep162,DAN AND MARCIE DECIDE TO TAKE A QUICK PEEK INSIDE.
190,ep162,BUYING A HOME THAT'S IN THE PROCESS OF A RENOVATION THEN COMPLETING THE WORK THEMSELVES MIGHT JUST BE AN AFFORDABLE WAY FOR DAN AND MARCIE TO GET A GREAT HOUSE.
191,ep162,I DON'T KNOW...
192,ep162,"IT LOOKS LIKE IT NEEDS SOME WORK, BUT..."
193,ep162,IT'S OKAY.
194,ep162,"(Suzanne) PLEASED WITH WHAT THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE, DAN AND MARCIE WANT TO GET A CLOSER LOOK."
195,ep162,"WELL, WHY DON'T YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND AND FIND OUT WHO WE NEED TO TALK TO ABOUT IT, AND THEN SEE IF WE CAN GET IN, TAKE A LOOK AT IT."
196,ep162,OKAY... CALL 'EM RIGHT NOW.
197,ep162,YEAH. GONNA GO AROUND BACK...
198,ep162,SEE WHAT THE YARD LOOKS LIKE.
199,ep162,"OKAY. WHILE MARCIE CONTACTS THE REALTOR WHO'LL BE LISTING THE HOME, DAN CHECKS AROUND BACK."
200,ep162,"IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE RENOVATION IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT THERE MAY STILL BE ROOM FOR THE COUPLE TO NEGOTIATE ON THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE."
201,ep162,HI... THIS SAM?
202,ep162,"HI, SAM..."
203,ep162,"I'M OVER HERE AT THE SOUTH ADRONA HOUSE, AND I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD GET IN TO LOOK AT IT."
204,ep162,"(Suzanne) SOON AFTER RECEIVING A CALL FROM MARCIE, SAM OLSON, THE REALTOR REPRESENTING THIS HOME, ARRIVES TO SHOW IT."
205,ep162,THIS IS MY WIFE MARCIE.
206,ep162,NICE MEETING YOU.
207,ep162,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS HOUSE?
208,ep162,IT'S NICE.
209,ep162,IT'S NICE...
210,ep162,IT LOOKS GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE.
211,ep162,I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE INSIDE.
212,ep162,IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARACTER TO IT.
213,ep162,I THINK I'D BE NICE.
214,ep162,"WHY DON'T WE GO IN, AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT."
215,ep162,SO HOW MUCH MORE WORK DO YOU HAVE LEFT?
216,ep162,"OH, WE'VE STILL GOT QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO DO."
217,ep162,WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO HERE ON THE PATIO AS YOU CAN SEE.
218,ep162,YEAH... LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BIT THERE.
219,ep162,"WHY DON'T WE GO IN AND TAKE A LOOK, THOUGH, AND WE'LL SEE WHAT'S INSIDE."
220,ep162,OKAY. GOT A LOT OF NICE DETAIL TO IT.
221,ep162,"YEAH, IT DOES."
222,ep162,"THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS HOUSE, SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SEE IN HERE."
223,ep162,THE ARCHED DOORWAY INTO THE DINING ROOM IS REALLY NICE.
224,ep162,I LIKE THAT.
225,ep162,THE FIREPLACE.
226,ep162,"YEAH, THAT'S HUGE."
227,ep162,"I MEAN, YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT ANYMORE."
228,ep162,IT'S GOT A LOT OF NEAT STUFF THAT YOU DON'T SEE DONE ANYMORE IN HOUSES.
229,ep162,WHY DON'T YOU COME ON IN HERE IN THE DINING ROOM?
230,ep162,I'LL SHOW YOU A FEW THINGS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON.
231,ep162,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ROOMS IN HERE.
232,ep162,"IT'S GOT A LOT OF NICE DETAIL TO IT, YOU KNOW, THE ROUNDED CEILINGS."
233,ep162,"YEAH, THAT REALLY DOES LOOK NICE."
234,ep162,IT LOOKS VERY NICE.
235,ep162,AND THE DETAIL.
236,ep162,THAT HUTCH IS NICE.
237,ep162,WHY DON'T WE GO INTO THE KITCHEN?
238,ep162,I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THERE.
239,ep162,OKAY. IS THE KITCHEN.
240,ep162,YOU'VE GOT A GOOD SIZE KITCHEN.
241,ep162,THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE ROOMS THAT STILL NEEDS SOME WORK.
242,ep162,"NOW WHAT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF US FINISHING IT OURSELVES, MAYBE TO SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND KIND OF DO IT IN OUR OWN STYLE?"
243,ep162,YOU THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO DO THAT?
244,ep162,"YEAH... FATHER'S A CONTRACTOR, AND I'M SURE I COULD GET HIM TO COME DOWN HERE AND HELP US."
245,ep162,"IF YOU COULD DO THAT, YOU'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SAVE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY."
246,ep162,"YOU COULD GET THE HOUSE CHEAPER, AND YOU'D PROBABLY GET IT MORE THE WAY YOU WANT IT INSTEAD OF THE WAY SOMEONE ELSE WANTS IT."
247,ep162,"(Suzanne) THE POSSIBILITIES ARE PROMISING, BUT THERE'S STILL MORE TO SEE."
248,ep162,THIS IS THE SECOND BEDROOM HERE.
249,ep162,"(Suzanne) UNBOTHERED BY THE WORK THAT STILL REMAINS, THE POWERS ARE ALREADY IMAGINING THEMSELVES IN THIS SPACE."
250,ep162,"THERE'S STILL SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THERE, BUT IT COULD BE A REAL CUTE BATHROOM."
251,ep162,AND THIS IS THE ONLY BATHROOM...
252,ep162,RIGHT? ONLY ONE.
253,ep162,OKAY. THE HOUSE GETS A STRIKE WITH ONLY ONE BATHROOM.
254,ep162,NOW IT'S UP TO THE MASTER BEDROOM TO MAKE UP FOR IT.
255,ep162,IT'S STILL GOT THE SAME DETAIL AS YOU'D HAVE IN THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
256,ep162,STILL GOT THE CURVED CEILINGS AND HARDWOOD FLOORS.
257,ep162,"YEAH, THAT'S NICE."
258,ep162,NICE SIZED BEDROOM.
259,ep162,YEAH. GET ALL THE BEDROOM FURNITURE IN ONE ROOM INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT ONES.
260,ep162,YEAH. WOULD BE NICE.
261,ep162,USE THE SPARE ROOM AS A COMPUTER ROOM NOW.
262,ep162,"YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT."
263,ep162,ALL RIGHT.
264,ep162,(Suzanne) THIS HOME IS EXPECTED TO SELL QUICKLY WHEN IT GOES ON THE MARKET.
265,ep162,"IF DAN AND MARCIE WANT TO SECURE IT, THEY'LL HAVE TO ACT FAST."
266,ep162,"WELL, WHAT'D YOU THINK?"
267,ep162,I LIKE IT.
268,ep162,YEAH... NICE.
269,ep162,(Sam) IT'S A PRETTY NEAT HOUSE...
270,ep162,HUH? IS.
271,ep162,(Suzanne) THE HOUSE IS EVEN MORE APPEALING TO THE POWERS SINCE MARCIE'S FATHER IS A CONTRACTOR AND WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP THEM COMPLETE THE RENOVATIONS.
272,ep162,(Marcie) I LIKE IT.
273,ep162,YOU LIKE IT?
274,ep162,YES. IT'S ONLY GOT ONE BATHROOM.
275,ep162,THAT'S ALL RIGHT...
276,ep162,WE CAN PUT IN A SECOND BATHROOM.
277,ep162,OKAY... THAT'S THE ONE YOU WANT.
278,ep162,THIS IS THE ONE I WANT.
279,ep162,"ALL RIGHT, THEN WE'LL MAKE AN OFFER ON IT."
280,ep162,"OKAY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT ONLY HAS ONE BATHROOM, THE COUPLE HAS A STRONG FEELING ABOUT THIS HOUSE."
281,ep162,BUT THEY AGREE TO GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP BEFORE OFFICIALLY MAKING AN OFFER.
282,ep162,"THE NEXT DAY, THE POWERS CALL REALTOR SAM OLSON WHILE ON THEIR WAY TO LUNCH."
283,ep162,"HI, SAM..."
284,ep162,THIS IS MARCIE POWERS.
285,ep162,YEAH... LIKE TO MAKE AN OFFER ON THE HOUSE.
286,ep162,CAN WE DO IT OVER THE PHONE?
287,ep162,THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO RIGHT NOW.
288,ep162,"OH, GOOD..."
289,ep162,"OKAY. MARCIE LEARNS FROM SAM THAT, BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS OWNED BY INVESTORS, NOT AN INDIVIDUAL, THE OFFER PROCESS TAKES LESS TIME."
290,ep162,SO THE POWERS COULD FIND OUT ANY MINUTE IF THEY GOT THE HOUSE OR NOT.
291,ep162,MARCIE AND DAN POWERS HAVE FOUND A HOME THAT FITS THEM PERFECTLY.
292,ep162,WILL THEIR OFFER BE ACCEPTED AND THEIR SEARCH FINALLY OVER?
293,ep162,STAY TUNED.
294,ep162,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
295,ep162,"AFTER LOOKING FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS, MARCIE AND DAN POWERS HAVE FINALLY FOUND A PROMISING HOME."
296,ep162,"NOT WANTING TO LOOK ANY FURTHER, THEY QUICKLY MADE AN OFFER WHILE ON THEIR WAY TO LUNCH."
297,ep162,THE FAMILY EXPECTS TO HEAR BACK FROM THEIR REALTOR SAM OLSON AT ANY TIME.
298,ep162,"IF WE GET THE HOUSE, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO FIRST?"
299,ep162,I DON'T KNOW.
300,ep162,"WE'VE GOTTA DO FLOORS IN THE HALLWAY AND THE BEDROOMS, AND WE'VE GOT TO PAINT."
301,ep162,"WE GOTTA GET THAT KITCHEN DONE, BECAUSE THERE'S NO CABINET DOORS."
302,ep162,(phone ringing) HELLO.
303,ep162,"WELL, HI, SAM..."
304,ep162,HOW ARE YOU?
305,ep162,"(Suzanne) AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF SEARCHING, THE POWERS' HOUSE HUNT HAS A HAPPY ENDING."
306,ep162,ALL RIGHTY...
307,ep162,BYE-BYE. RIGHT...
308,ep162,WE GOT THE HOUSE.
309,ep162,(Suzanne) THE POWERS ARE SURPRISED THAT THEIR OFFER WAS ACCEPTED SO QUICKLY.
310,ep162,ALL RIGHT.
311,ep162,"YEA! AFTER LUNCH, THE RESTAURANT STAFF HELPS THE POWERS FAMILY CELEBRATE THEIR GOOD FORTUNE."
312,ep162,WOW! YOU VERY MUCH...
313,ep162,ALL RIGHT!
314,ep162,"(Suzanne) BY ACTING SO QUICKLY AND BUYING A HOUSE THAT WAS NOT MOVE-IN READY, THE POWERS HAVE SAVED THEMSELVES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY."
315,ep162,"NOW WITH THE RENOVATIONS NEARLY COMPLETE, THE POWERS HAVE FINALLY MOVED INTO THEIR FIRST HOME."
316,ep162,(Marcie) WE ARE SO HAPPY WITH THIS HOUSE.
317,ep162,IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO BE ABLE TO SIT HERE AND CALL IT OUR OWN.
318,ep162,YEAH. REALLY...
319,ep162,"I MEAN, FOR AS MUCH STRESS AS WE WENT THROUGH AND EVERYTHING IN BUYING THE HOUSE, WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER, IT WAS JUST SUCH A GOOD FEELING."
320,ep162,"AND WE'RE JUST SO HAPPY WITH THE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANNA DO TO IT AND MAKE IT OUR OWN."
321,ep162,IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT.
322,ep162,"(Suzanne) SINCE THEIR NEW HOME IS MUCH LARGER THAN THEIR OLD ONE, THE POWERS CAN FIT ALL OF THEIR FURNITURE NEATLY INTO EACH RESPECTIVE ROOM."
323,ep162,"(Marcie) IT'S VERY NICE BEING ABLE TO HAVE OUR FULL DINING ROOM SET IN THE DINING ROOM, WHICH IS INCLUDING OUR HUTCH."
324,ep162,"IT HAD BEEN TUCKED AWAY FAR AWAY IN THE CORNER OF A BEDROOM, 'CAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE IT'D FIT."
325,ep162,"NOW IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN, AND MY MOM CAME THROUGH AND PUT ALL HER LITTLE DECORATIVE TOUCHES ON THAT FOR ME WHILE I WAS BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS."
326,ep162,"(Suzanne) DAN AND MARCIE'S FOUR- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER ALLISON IS ALSO ENJOYING THE NEW HOME AND HER NEW, MORE SPACIOUS BEDROOM."
327,ep162,(Dan) OUR DAUGHTER ALLISON REALLY LIKES THE PLACE.
328,ep162,"SHE'S GOT HER OWN BEDROOM, WHICH SHE HAD BEFORE, BUT NOW SHE'S GOT A FULL-SIZE BED AND A LOT MORE ROOM IN HER BEDROOM THAN SHE HAD BEFORE."
329,ep162,"(Suzanne) MARCIE'S FAVORITE ROOM IS THE LIVING ROOM, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEIR SECTIONAL SOFA CAN REMAIN ALL IN ONE PIECE."
330,ep162,"(Marcie) THE WAY WE'VE GOT IT SET UP WITH OUR COUCH, IT MAKES IT SEEM SO COZY, AND WITH THE FIREPLACE RIGHT THERE, EVENTUALLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A FIRE AND ALL SNUGGLE ON THE COUCH AND WATCH THE FIRE."
331,ep162,I JUST CAN'T WAIT SO WE CAN DO THAT.
332,ep162,"(Suzanne) FOR DAN, THE KITCHEN IS KEY, AND THE NEW ONE WITH ITS OPEN LAYOUT OFFERS MUCH MORE WORKABLE SPACE."
333,ep162,"THERE'S ALSO A DISHWASHER, WHICH THE COUPLE HASN'T HAD IN FOUR YEARS."
334,ep162,I LIKE TO COOK.
335,ep162,"WE HAD TO BUY A BRAND-NEW STOVE, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STOVE HERE, SO I WAS ABLE TO PICK OUT SOMETHING THAT I LIKED, AND THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A LOT OF USE OUT OF."
336,ep162,(Suzanne) BUYING AN UNFINISHED HOME ENABLED THE POWERS TO DO WHAT AT FIRST SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE.
337,ep162,"I THINK ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, FOR US, THIS EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS BUYING A HOUSE THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF BEING RENOVATED AND STUFF, WE WERE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE ON THE LINE OF WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR, SOMETHING WITH SOME CHARACTER AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT, AND THEN BE ABLE TO COME IN AND MAKE IT WHAT WE WANTED."
338,ep162,IT'S JUST THE MOST WONDERFUL FEELING TO BE ABLE TO OWN THIS HOME.
339,ep162,WE JUST LOVE IT.
340,ep162,"YEAH. FIRST-TIME BUYERS, DAN AND MARCIE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THEIR PURCHASE."
341,ep162,"BUYING A HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF A RENOVATION ENABLED THEM TO SAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET A HOUSE WITH CHARACTER THAT THEY CAN ENJOY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME."

12,ep163,"THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T LIKED-- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T MAKE CHANGES TO THE APARTMENT-- BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S BEEN OKAY."
13,ep163,"I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT I DON'T HAVE A BACKYARD, AND I'M GETTING SICK OF HAVING TO WALK UP STEPS TO GET TO MY APARTMENT, AND HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT HOW MUCH NOISE I MAKE SO I DON'T UPSET THE NEIGHBORS, AND YOU KNOW, JUST STANDARD APARTMENT STUFF."
14,ep163,IT'S GETTING SMALL.
15,ep163,"(Suzanne) MOST 19-YEAR-OLDS ARE WORKING ON THEIR COLLEGE DEGREES, BUT NOT SHAUN."
16,ep163,"AT 16 HE FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL, MOVED IN TO HIS FIRST APARTMENT AND DECIDED TO GET A HEAD START ON HIS CAREER."
17,ep163,"IT'S PAID OFF FOR HIM, AND HE WANTS TO PUT THE MONEY HE'S MADE TO GOOD USE."
18,ep163,IT WAS ACTUALLY A DECISION TO BUY BECAUSE I'M SICK OF PAYING RENT.
19,ep163,"IT'S JUST THROWING MONEY AWAY, AND I'M NEVER GONNA SEE ANY OF THAT AGAIN."
20,ep163,"SO I WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING SO I COULD START BUILDING EQUITY IN A HOUSE, AND HOPEFULLY GO TO A BETTER HOUSE IN A COUPLE YEARS."
21,ep163,(Suzanne) SO WHAT EXACTLY IS SHAUN LOOKING FOR IN A HOUSE?
22,ep163,"WELL, FOR STARTERS, SOMETHING A LITTLE ROOMIER THAN HIS CURRENT APARTMENT."
23,ep163,"(Shaun) I'M LOOKING FOR A THREE BEDROOM, TWO BATH WITH A DECENT-SIZE BACKYARD, AND A TWO CAR GARAGE-- A HOUSE THAT DOESN'T NEED TOO MUCH WORK."

33,ep163,"I WANTED A HOUSE WITH A BIG BACKYARD, BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET A DOG, AND ALSO WAS THINKING ABOUT LIKE A SPA OR A POOL OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO BETTER IN A BACKYARD THAN A BALCONY."
34,ep163,(Suzanne) ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR SHAUN IS THAT HE'S ABLE TO WIRE HIS NEW PLACE FOR A NETWORKED COMPUTER SYSTEM.
35,ep163,(Shaun) I WAS THINKING ABOUT ALSO PUTTING SOME SORT OF HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM AND SETTING UP THE HOUSE WITH A NETWORK SO THAT I CAN PUT COMPUTERS IN DIFFERENT ROOMS.
36,ep163,"AND WITH AN APARTMENT I CAN'T DRILL ANY HOLES, AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT THE INVESTMENT INTO PUTTING AN AUTOMATION SYSTEM IN IT THAT'S GONNA BE RIPPED OUT AS SOON AS I MOVE."

47,ep163,"WELL, I THINK SHAUN FELT REAL COMFORTABLE WITH US, 'CAUSE WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME, AND I THINK THE TRUST WAS THERE BETWEEN ALL OF US TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND MAKE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PURCHASES THAT SHAUN WILL EVER MAKE, TOGETHER."

59,ep163,"BUT SHAUN IS NOT JUST SHOPPING FOR A HOME, HE'S ALSO SHOPPING FOR A MORTGAGE."
60,ep163,AND DUE TO HIS SHORT CREDIT HISTORY IT'S THAT PART OF THE PROCESS WHICH IS PROVING MORE DIFFICULT THAN EXPECTED.

62,ep163,I KNOW YOU'RE USING YOUR CREDIT UNION.
63,ep163,HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

145,ep163,DEFINITELY BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE.
146,ep163,"YEAH, THIS IS NICE AND CLEAN, BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOO SMALL OUT HERE."
147,ep163,"YEAH, I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU."
148,ep163,"IT HAS A LITTLE PRIVACY, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE SOME LARGE FENCES, BUT YOU'RE SORT OF ENCLOSED HERE."
149,ep163,"YEAH, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A PARKING LOT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BACK WALL."
150,ep163,I'D RATHER HAVE A NEIGHBOR BACK THERE.

155,ep163,"I TALKED TO THE MORTGAGE LOAN BROKER YESTERDAY, AND HE'S REVIEWING YOUR PAPERWORK, AND HE SHOULD HAVE SOME DIFFERENT LOANS FOR YOU BY TOMORROW TO HELP US OUT."
156,ep163,GREAT. GO CHECK OUT A BEDROOM.
157,ep163,OKAY. SHAUN'S BIGGEST PROBLEM SO FAR HAS BEEN SECURING FINANCING.

162,ep163,"SHAUN'S FRIENDS AND REALTORS, STEVE ERDELY AND CHAD CERETTO, HAVE SHOWN HIM TWO HOMES SO FAR, BUT SHAUN ISN'T FINDING WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR."
163,ep163,CHAD AND STEVE WANT TO GET SHAUN A LITTLE MORE HOUSE FOR HIS MONEY.
164,ep163,SO THE TRIO HAS DECIDED TO MOVE THEIR SEARCH TO ANOTHER PART OF TOWN WHERE REAL ESTATE PRICES ARE MORE AFFORDABLE.
165,ep163,"HEY, SHAUN, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE THIS HOUSE."
166,ep163,"YEAH, I LIKE THE OUTSIDE."
167,ep163,IT'S GOT A NICE LONG DRIVEWAY.

178,ep163,"I LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THIS KITCHEN, BUT LOOK AT THIS OVEN!"
179,ep163,THIS THING IS PRETTY OLD HERE!
180,ep163,YEAH. THINK THAT OVEN'S OLDER THAN ALL OF US COMBINED!
181,ep163,WHAT IS THIS?
182,ep163,WHAT IS A GRILLEVATOR?
183,ep163,THE GRILLEVATOR!
184,ep163,"HEY, LOOK, YOU GOT THE ROASTAMETER OVER THERE TOO!"
185,ep163,"WELL, THAT'S GOOD."
186,ep163,"THAT'S REAL EASY TO FIX, THOUGH."
187,ep163,"I MEAN, JUST BUY A NEW OVEN, NO PROBLEM."
188,ep163,YEAH. LET'S GO LOOK AT A BEDROOM.
189,ep163,OKAY. I TOLD YOU YOU'D LIKE THIS PLACE!
190,ep163,(Steve) LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MASTER BEDROOM.
191,ep163,"YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
192,ep163,I LIKE IT.
193,ep163,"YEAH, THIS IS NICE."
194,ep163,"IT'S PRETTY BIG, AND I LIKE THE WINDOWS ON IT."
195,ep163,BATHROOM OVER HERE.

200,ep163,YOU THINK IT'LL WORK FOR YOU?
201,ep163,"YEAH. LIKE THE SIZE OF IT, AND IT LOOKS, YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS GOOD."
202,ep163,NOW FOR THE TREAT.
203,ep163,I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LIKE THIS.
204,ep163,"THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA SELL YOU ON THIS HOUSE, I THINK."
205,ep163,LET'S GO OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE BACKYARD.
206,ep163,OKAY. WOW...
207,ep163,IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOT A POOL OUT HERE.
208,ep163,"YEAH, IT'S A REALLY, REALLY BIG POOL, A REALLY NICE-SIZE POOL."
209,ep163,IT'S GOT A NICE LITTLE GRASS AREA.
210,ep163,"YEAH, I LIKE THIS."
211,ep163,IT'S GREAT.
212,ep163,I LIKE THE FACT THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH GRASS.
213,ep163,I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO MOW.
214,ep163,DEFINITELY. MAKES IT REALLY NICE.
215,ep163,THIS IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE OVER HERE-- THE MANLY-MAN BARBECUE.
216,ep163,IS THIS A REFRIGERATOR DOWN HERE?
217,ep163,"YEAH, YOU GOT A REFRIGERATOR."
218,ep163,YOU GOT A SINK...
219,ep163,GOT A BARBECUE.
220,ep163,"GOT A, YOU KNOW, A GRILL..."
221,ep163,YOU GOT EVERYTHING.
222,ep163,"I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE A WHOLE KITCHEN OUT HERE."
223,ep163,"ALL RIGHT, YEAH, I REALLY LIKE THIS PLACE, SO LET'S GO LOOK IT OVER ONE MORE TIME, AND MAYBE WE CAN WRITE UP AN OFFER ON IT."
224,ep163,"OH, OKAY, WELL, I'M GLAD YOU REALLY LIKE THIS."
225,ep163,LET'S GO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK...
226,ep163,THIS IS A BIG DECISION.
227,ep163,WE DON'T WANT TO PRESSURE YOU.
228,ep163,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT SHAUN HAS FOUND A HOUSE HE REALLY LIKES, FEAR SETS IN."
229,ep163,"HE'S ABOUT TO MAKE THE BIGGEST PURCHASE OF HIS LIFE, AND HE WANTS TO BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE HOUSE HE WANTS."
230,ep163,"I THINK I WANT TO SLEEP ON IT, AND YOU KNOW..."
231,ep163,THINK ABOUT IT.
232,ep163,"WE CAN COME BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT AGAIN TOMORROW, AND HOPEFULLY WRITE UP AN OFFER THEN FOR IT."
233,ep163,THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
234,ep163,"JUST BE AWARE THAT GOOD HOUSES WON'T LAST A LONG TIME, SO WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION PRETTY SOON."
235,ep163,"OKAY. A TOUGH DECISION, BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS ONE DEFINITELY HAS SOME POTENTIAL."
236,ep163,"YEAH, IT DOES."
237,ep163,"ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S GO GET SOME LUNCH."
238,ep163,"OKAY. OVER LUNCH THEY CONTEMPLATE A GAME PLAN, AND THEN DECIDE TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE THE NEXT DAY FOR ONE LAST LOOK."
239,ep163,I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE PLACE.
240,ep163,COULD BE SHAUN'S FUTURE HOUSE HERE.
241,ep163,HOPEFULLY. THIS HOUSE IS GREAT.
242,ep163,IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
243,ep163,EXCELLENT. DO YOU THINK OF THIS NICE-SIZE POOL OVER HERE?
244,ep163,I LOVE IT.
245,ep163,SO I THINK I'M PRETTY MUCH READY TO WRITE UP AN OFFER.
246,ep163,"LET'S JUST GO GLANCE OVER THE REST OF THE HOUSE, AND I THINK I'M READY."
247,ep163,EXCELLENT. GO...
248,ep163,ALL RIGHT.
249,ep163,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT SHAUN HAS DEFINITELY DECIDED ON THIS HOUSE, IT'S UP TO STEVE AND CHAD TO MAKE SURE THEIR FRIEND GETS IT."
250,ep163,"WHILE SHAUN HEADS BACK TO WORK, HIS TWO REALTORS START BY FILLING OUT ALL THE NECESSARY PAPERWORK THAT COMES WITH MAKING AN OFFER."
251,ep163,"THEN THEY'LL NEED TO MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS, BECAUSE SHAUN HAS STILL NOT FOUND A LENDER THAT WILL PREQUALIFY HIM FOR A MORTGAGE."
252,ep163,"UNTIL HIS FINANCING IS IN PLACE, THE SELLERS MAY NOT EVEN CONSIDER HIS OFFER."
253,ep163,"WITHOUT A MORTGAGE LENDER TO BACK IT UP, WILL SHAUN'S OFFER GET THE CONSIDERATION IT DESERVES?"
254,ep163,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
255,ep163,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
256,ep163,"IF HIS OFFER IS ACCEPTED, 19-YEAR-OLD SHAUN COOLEY IS ABOUT TO BECOME A HOMEOWNER."
257,ep163,"THE HOUSE HE'S FOUND IS ABOUT 35 MILES FROM HIS HOMETOWN AND HAS THREE BEDROOMS, TWO BATHS, A LARGE KITCHEN, AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, A SWIMMING POOL WHERE SHAUN CAN THROW SOME GREAT POOL PARTIES."
258,ep163,"NOW ALL THAT REMAINS IS FOR SHAUN'S REALTORS, STEVE ERDELY AND CHAD CERETTO, TO INFORM HIM WHETHER OR NOT HIS LOAN APPLICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED."
259,ep163,SHAUN'S REALTORS AGREED TO NOTIFY SHAUN ABOUT HIS LOAN AND HIS OFFER VIA E-MAIL.
260,ep163,"SO TWO DAYS LATER WHEN SHAUN ARRIVES AT WORK, THE GOOD NEWS ARRIVES ON HIS DESKTOP."
261,ep163,ALL RIGHT!
262,ep163,"(Suzanne) FINALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE SHAUN WILL GET THE MORTGAGE HE NEEDS TO PURCHASE THE HOUSE HE WANTS."
263,ep163,"WITH HIS FINANCING SECURED, SHAUN'S OFFER WAS QUICKLY ACCEPTED."
264,ep163,"AND JUST A SHORT TIME LATER, HE'S FEELING RIGHT AT HOME."
265,ep163,(Shaun) I LIKE THE FACT THAT THIS IS MY HOUSE.
266,ep163,I LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN CHANGE ANYTHING THAT I WANT TO CHANGE.
267,ep163,"I WAS HAPPY THAT I HAD RECEIVED THE HOME LOAN, BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT I WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THE HOUSE THAT I WANTED AND MEANT THAT I WASN'T GONNA FALL OUT OF ESCROW."
268,ep163,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT THE HARD PART OF THE HOME-BUYING PROCESS IS OVER, SHAUN CAN GET ON WITH THE FUN PART--ENJOYING HIS NEW HOME."
269,ep163,"(Shaun) MY FAVORITE ROOM IS PROBABLY MY OFFICE, NOW THAT I HAVE ONE."
270,ep163,IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE MY DESK AND COMPUTER OUT OF MY BEDROOM.
271,ep163,"IT'S PRETTY EMPTY NOW, SO I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO BUY MORE STUFF FOR IT, LIKE BIGGER FILING CABINETS AND OTHER OFFICE STUFF."
272,ep163,"(Suzanne) AT THE MOMENT, SHAUN IS BUSY UNCOVERING THE SECRETS HIS NEW HOUSE HOLDS."
273,ep163,I'VE PUT STUFF ON THE GRILLEVATOR.
274,ep163,I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT THE PURPOSE OF THE GRILLEVATOR.
275,ep163,I HAVEN'T YET MADE IT GO UP OR DOWN WITH FOOD ON IT!
276,ep163,SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR YET.
277,ep163,I'M GONNA FIND OUT!
278,ep163,"(Suzanne) SHAUN ALSO APPRECIATES THE HOME'S OTHER FUN EXTRAS, LIKE ITS ELECTRIC GARAGE DOOR."
279,ep163,BUT HE'S GOT HIS HEART SET ON WIRING THE HOUSE FOR MORE ELABORATE ELECTRONICS.
280,ep163,"SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE HERE I PLAN ON WIRING EVERY ROOM FOR COMPUTER AND VIDEO AND AUDIO AND TELEPHONE, 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE ROOMS IN THIS HOUSE THAT HAVE TELEPHONE, AND EVEN LESS ROOMS THAT HAVE VIDEO."
281,ep163,AND THEN I ALSO PLAN TO POSSIBLY PUT AN AUTOMATION SYSTEM IN HERE.
282,ep163,(Suzanne) SHAUN'S FIRST LESSON IN HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THAT THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER PROJECT.
283,ep163,"BUT EVEN BEFORE HE HAS IT WIRED THE WAY HE'D LIKE IT, SHAUN'S NEW HOUSE HAS PLENTY TO OFFER."
284,ep163,(Shaun) THE BACKYARD'S PROBABLY MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS HOUSE.
285,ep163,I LIKE THE POOL AND THE BARBECUE.
286,ep163,IT'S A NICE ENVIRONMENT.
287,ep163,IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO HAVE GET-TOGETHERS WITH FRIENDS AND STUFF.
288,ep163,"HEY, GUYS."
289,ep163,"HEY, WHAT'S UP, SHAUN?"
290,ep163,(Suzanne) AND HE'S DOING EXACTLY THAT.
291,ep163,THIS FIRST-TIME HOMEOWNER IS HOSTING A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER FOR STEVE AND CHAD TO SHOW THEM HOW MUCH HE'S APPRECIATED THEIR HELP IN FINDING HIS DREAM HOME.
292,ep163,"IT WAS NICE TO HAVE CHAD AND STEVE HELP ME LOOK FOR THE HOUSE, BECAUSE THEY WERE MY FRIENDS."
293,ep163,I DIDN'T FEEL I HAD TO BE AS FORMAL WITH THEM AS I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE WITH A NORMAL REAL ESTATE AGENT.
294,ep163,IT MADE THE WHOLE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT EASIER.
295,ep163,"THEY KNEW MY TASTES AND WHAT I LIKED AND DIDN'T LIKE, SO THEY HELPED ME OUT TO FIND A HOUSE AND NOT WASTE A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT STUFF THAT I WASN'T GONNA LIKE IN THE FIRST PLACE."
296,ep163,"(Suzanne) SHAUN FEELS FORTUNATE THAT CHAD AND STEVE WERE THERE TO OFFER A HELPING HAND, AND SHAUN IS READY AND WILLING TO RETURN THE FAVOR!"
297,ep163,(laughter) HELPING THEIR FRIEND SHAUN FIND A HOME GAVE CHAD AND STEVE A REASON TO CELEBRATE AS WELL.
298,ep163,"SHAUN GOT HIS HOUSE, AND THE YOUNG REALTORS COMPLETED THEIR VERY FIRST SALE."

1,ep164,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep164,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep164,"NEWLYWEDS NIKKI AND WARREN DOW HAVE BEEN DOING ALL THEIR LIVING, EATING AND SLEEPING IN ONE ROOM."
4,ep164,THE TIME IS RIGHT TO START LOOKING FOR A HOUSE THAT WILL GIVE THEM THE ELBOW ROOM THEY BOTH WANT.
5,ep164,BUT THESE FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS ARE ALSO ON A TIGHT BUDGET.
6,ep164,WILL NIKKI AND WARREN HAVE TO SEARCH DAY AND NIGHT TO FIND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR?
7,ep164,IT'S ALL NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep164,"♪♪ EVER SINCE NEWLYWEDS WARREN AND NIKKI DOW BEGAN RENTING THIS TINY APARTMENT, THE COUPLE'S EATING, LIVING AND SLEEPING SPACE HAS BEEN PACKED INTO ONE ROOM."
9,ep164,"IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THEY STARTED FEELING THE PINCH, SO THEY DECIDED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO IT WAS TIME FOR A CHANGE."
10,ep164,WE HAVE ONE ROOM.
11,ep164,"IT'S ACTUALLY A ONE- BEDROOM APARTMENT, BUT THE ROOM THAT WE HAVE IS SO SMALL THAT WE'RE USING THE LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM/FAMILY ROOM, EVERYTHING, BEDROOM, AS OUR MAIN ROOM."
12,ep164,"(Suzanne) THE APARTMENT'S BEDROOM WAS TOO SMALL FOR THE COUPLE'S FURNITURE, SO THEY'VE TURNED THAT ROOM INTO A MUCH NEEDED STORAGE AREA."
13,ep164,"DESPITE ITS SMALL SIZE, THE APARTMENT HAS SOME CHARMING FEATURES THAT NIKKI AND WARREN ENJOY."
14,ep164,"ALTHOUGH IT'S SMALL, IT IS OPEN AND AIRY."
15,ep164,"WE HAVE A LOT OF WINDOWS IN HERE, AND WE KIND OF..."
16,ep164,THERE'S A NICE OCEAN BREEZE THAT COMES THROUGH.
17,ep164,WE HAVE A HUGE FIREPLACE AND MANTEL.
18,ep164,"AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE COMING HOME TO LIKE A CABIN ENVIRONMENT, A LITTLE VACATION HOME."
19,ep164,(Suzanne) BUT THE VACATION HOUSE FEEL JUST ISN'T ENOUGH FOR EVERYDAY LIFE.
20,ep164,"WHAT DOESN'T WORK FOR US IN THIS PLACE IS OBVIOUSLY SPACE IS AN ISSUE WITH STORAGE, CLOSETS."
21,ep164,"WE HAVE ONE CLOSET, BASICALLY, WE SHARE."
22,ep164,"WE HAVE ONE CLOSET, BASICALLY, WE SHARE."
23,ep164,CLOSET SPACE.
24,ep164,CLOSET SPACE.
25,ep164,"WE CAN'T EVEN BUY NEW CLOTHES AT THIS POINT, BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIT ANY MORE CLOTHES IN OUR CLOSET."
26,ep164,MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING.
27,ep164,MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING.
28,ep164,"YEAH. WARREN AND NIKKI BOTH LIKE TO COOK, BUT THEIR CURRENT KITCHEN JUST UNDERSCORES THEIR NEED FOR A BIGGER SPACE."
29,ep164,"WE BASICALLY ONLY HAVE ONE OUTLET PLUG FOR ALL OUR APPLIANCES, SO IT GETS VERY FRUSTRATING."
30,ep164,"IF YOU WANNA USE YOUR CUISINART OR YOUR BLENDER, YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG THE MICROWAVE, YOU KNOW, REDO THE TIME, THINGS LIKE THAT."
31,ep164,"IT'S ALMOST TO THE POINT WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN WANNA BOTHER WITH TRYING TO MAKE A NICE MEAL, BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO COMPLICATED."
32,ep164,"(Suzanne) FOR NIKKI AND WARREN, THE APARTMENT'S WALLS ARE ALSO A PROBLEM."
33,ep164,(Warren) WITH THE CINDER BLOCK IT'S REALLY...
34,ep164,IT'S COLD.
35,ep164,IT'S DEFINITELY COLD.
36,ep164,IT'S DEFINITELY COLD.
37,ep164,"IT LOOKS COLD, TOO."
38,ep164,"IT LOOKS COLD, TOO."
39,ep164,"YOU COME HOME AND YOU'RE LIKE, OH, GOSH!"
40,ep164,YOU COME HOME...
41,ep164,"YOU HAVE TO PUT ON A SWEATSHIRT, SWEATS."
42,ep164,YOU CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND IN YOUR PAJAMAS.
43,ep164,YOU REALLY GET COLD.
44,ep164,"YOU HAVE TO HAVE SLIPPERS ON, A ROBE."
45,ep164,TWO SOCKS.
46,ep164,TWO SOCKS.
47,ep164,IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SKIING OR YOU'RE CAMPING SOMEWHERE.
48,ep164,"(Suzanne) THE DOWS CURRENTLY HAVE A PATIO, BUT WANT THEIR NEW HOME TO HAVE A YARD, IDEALLY WITH SOME PRIVACY."
49,ep164,"INSIDE, THEY'VE GOT A WISH LIST THAT STARTS WITH A FIREPLACE."
50,ep164,"I LIKE FIRES, ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTERTIME..."
51,ep164,"A PLACE THAT HAS SOME CHARM TO IT, LIKE WITH SOME HARDWOOD FLOORS..."
52,ep164,"A LARGER KITCHEN WHERE WE COULD BOTH WORK AND MAKE THAT ALMOST LIKE A FAMILY ROOM, 'CAUSE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN THE KITCHEN."
53,ep164,(Suzanne) WARREN AND NIKKI ALSO BOTH WANT A HOME OFFICE.
54,ep164,"FOR RIGHT NOW, THE COMPUTER'S ON OUR DINING ROOM TABLE, WHICH WE CAN'T USE, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER'S THERE."
55,ep164,"YEAH, SO OUR KITCHEN IS OUR OFFICE."
56,ep164,OUR OFFICE IS OUR KITCHEN RIGHT NOW.
57,ep164,(Suzanne) ONE GREAT FEATURE OF THEIR APARTMENT THAT NIKKI AND WARREN DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP IS ITS BEACHSIDE LOCATION.
58,ep164,THE BIGGEST REASON WHY WE MOVED IN HERE WAS BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE BEACH.
59,ep164,WE FIGURED WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE AS CLOSE TO THE BEACH.
60,ep164,AND THAT'S WHY WE COMPROMISED WITH A SMALL PLACE.
61,ep164,AND THAT'S WHY WE COMPROMISED WITH A SMALL PLACE.
62,ep164,"YEAH. BUT NOW THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A HOME, THEY'RE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD."
63,ep164,THE DOWS KNOW THEY MIGHT HAVE TO SACRIFICE THE FABULOUS LOCATION TO GET THE SPACE THEY NEED.
64,ep164,AND THE DOWS HAVE THE ADDED PRESSURE OF BUYING IN A VERY HOT MARKET.
65,ep164,"THEY'VE ALREADY MISSED OUT ON SEVERAL HOMES, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MAKE AN OFFER SOON ENOUGH."
66,ep164,"I THINK IT'S HARD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS PICTURE IN YOUR MIND OF WHAT YOU WANT, AND THEN YOU GO OUT, AND YOU SEE HOMES, AND IT'S NOT..."
67,ep164,"ONE THING MIGHT BE RIGHT, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS WRONG."
68,ep164,"AND YOU TRY TO, YOU KNOW, FIGURE IN YOUR MIND, IS IT WORTH IT..."
69,ep164,IS IT WORTH EVERYTHING?
70,ep164,CAN I LIVE HERE...
71,ep164,AND IT'S HARD.
72,ep164,IT'S HARD TO MAKE A DECISION IN A FEW DAYS ABOUT WHERE YOU WANNA LIVE.
73,ep164,ABOUT WHERE YOU WANNA LIVE.
74,ep164,"RIGHT. WHEN WE COME BACK, WILL WARREN AND NIKKI FIND THAT THE HOUSES THEY CAN AFFORD DON'T HAVE WHAT THEY WANT?"
75,ep164,"IT'S GOOD SIZED, BUT IT'S, I DON'T KNOW..."
76,ep164,"IT'S NOT VERY PRIVATE, I GUESS."
77,ep164,(Suzanne) NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
78,ep164,WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
79,ep164,NEWLYWEDS WARREN AND NIKKI DOW ARE FEELING CRAMPED IN THEIR TINY APARTMENT WHERE ALMOST ALL THE LIVING SPACE IS CONFINED TO ONE ROOM.
80,ep164,SO THEY'VE DECIDED THE TIME HAS COME TO BUY A HOME.
81,ep164,"THEY HOPE TO FIND A PLACE THAT SHARES THEIR APARTMENT'S BEST FEATURE, ITS FABULOUS LOCATION NEAR THE BEACH."
82,ep164,THE CHALLENGE WILL BE FINDING A HOME THEY LIKE IN THE AREA THEY LOVE AT A PRICE THEY CAN AFFORD.
83,ep164,"HELPING THEM MEET THAT CHALLENGE IS REALTOR NEDA JONCICH, WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE NIKKI'S SISTER."
84,ep164,"NEDA HAS A GOOD IDEA ABOUT NOT ONLY WHAT WARREN AND NIKKI WANT, BUT ALSO WHAT HURDLES THEY MIGHT FACE."
85,ep164,THEY'RE VERY CAUTIOUS RIGHT NOW ON HOW THEY'RE APPROACHING THE SALE OF A HOUSE.
86,ep164,"THEY'LL SEE A HOUSE, AND THEY'LL THINK ABOUT IT."
87,ep164,AND MAYBE THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT...
88,ep164,"THEY MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH, AND THEY REALLY NEED TO MOVE AND PUT A BID IN FOR THE HOUSE THAT THEY REALLY LIKE."
89,ep164,(Suzanne) NIKKI AND WARREN HAVE ALREADY MISSED OUT ON SEVERAL HOUSES THEY LIKED AND ARE GETTING DISCOURAGED.

255,ep164,I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE HOUSE FOR US.
256,ep164,I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE HOUSE FOR US.
257,ep164,"NO? IN THE END, THE DOWS DECIDE TO WAIT FOR JUST THE RIGHT HOUSE AND HOPE THEIR TIMING IS ALSO JUST RIGHT."
258,ep164,"LATER THAT WEEK, NEDA COMES ACROSS A LISTING THAT LOOKS PERFECT ON PAPER."
259,ep164,IT'S IN A PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE DOWS LOVE BUT THOUGHT THEY COULD NEVER AFFORD.
260,ep164,"THE COUPLE IS WILLING TO DO SOME FIXING UP IF THEY FIND AN OTHERWISE IDEAL HOUSE, AND NEDA THINKS THIS ONE MAY BE IT."
261,ep164,"WASTING NO TIME, SHE HURRIES OUT TO SEE THE HOUSE, SO SHE CAN TELL WARREN AND NIKKI ABOUT IT IN DETAIL."
262,ep164,"IT LOOKS GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE, AND IT EVEN HAS A VIEW OF THE OCEAN."
263,ep164,"AFTER A QUICK LOOK INSIDE, NEDA IS CONVINCED THIS IS THE PERFECT HOUSE FOR HER SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW."

307,ep164,"EVEN THOUGH IT'S DARK, THEY CAN TELL THE HOUSE HAS A LOT OF THE FEATURES THEY WANT."
308,ep164,"IT'S SPACIOUS INSIDE, AND BECAUSE IT'S A FIXER-UPPER, IT'S REASONABLY PRICED."
309,ep164,"AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, NIKKI'S SISTER GAVE IT HER SEAL OF APPROVAL."

488,ep164,'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T GET THE OFFER IN.
489,ep164,"NO, I LOVE IT."
490,ep164,"NO, I LOVE IT."

492,ep164,LOOK AT THIS VIEW.
493,ep164,THIS IS THE BEST.
494,ep164,THIS IS THE BEST.
495,ep164,(Suzanne) SO NIKKI AND WARREN HAVE A HOUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN LOVE.
496,ep164,WILL MOVING IN CAUSE THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MIND AND REGRET THEIR HASTY DECISION?
497,ep164,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
498,ep164,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
499,ep164,WARREN AND NIKKI DOW HAD TO MAKE A QUICK DECISION ON A HOUSE THEY HAD ONLY SEEN ONE TIME AT NIGHT.
500,ep164,"THEY DIDN'T WANNA MISS OUT ON YET ANOTHER HOME, SO THEY SUBMITTED AN OFFER."
501,ep164,"WOW, WE GOT THE HOUSE."
502,ep164,WE DID?
503,ep164,WE DID?
504,ep164,"YEAH. WITHIN HOURS, THE DOWS' OFFER WAS ACCEPTED, BUT NOW THAT THEY'VE SETTLED IN, DO THEY FEEL THEIR GAMBLE PAID OFF?"
505,ep164,WE LOVE OUR NEW HOUSE.
506,ep164,IT'S GREAT.
507,ep164,IT'S GREAT.
508,ep164,I LOVE THE TREES.
509,ep164,I LOVE THE TREES.
510,ep164,IT'S QUIET...
511,ep164,THERE'S A COOL BREEZE.
512,ep164,YOU HEAR THE BIRDS.
513,ep164,IT'S NICE AND BIG AND SPACIOUS COMPARED TO OUR SMALL APARTMENT.
514,ep164,IT'S NICE TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE ROOM.
515,ep164,IT'S NICE TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE ROOM.
516,ep164,MM-HMM. THE HOUSE NEEDED QUITE A BIT OF COSMETIC WORK WHEN WARREN AND NIKKI BOUGHT IT.
517,ep164,"WHILE THAT MADE THE HOUSE MORE AFFORDABLE, THE AMOUNT OF WORK THESE FIRST-TIME BUYERS FACED WAS A LITTLE DAUNTING."
518,ep164,"INITIALLY WHEN WE SAW THIS PLACE, AND ACTUALLY AFTER WE HAD FOUND OUT WE GOT IT, WE WERE REALLY NERVOUS, 'CAUSE WE MAYBE THOUGHT WE WERE IN OVER OUR HEADS, 'CAUSE THIS HOUSE HAD SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE."
519,ep164,BUT WE'RE TOTALLY HAPPY ABOUT WHERE WE'VE COMEE WITH IT.
520,ep164,WE'RE REALLY HAPPY THAT WE STUCK IT OUT.
521,ep164,"(Suzanne) WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE ROOM THAT'S UNDERGONE THE BIGGEST TRANSFORMATION IN NIKKI AND WARREN'S HANDS IS THE KITCHEN."
522,ep164,"(Nikki) WE REDID OUR KITCHEN, AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS."
523,ep164,"WE PUT IN ALL NEW TILE AND CABINETS, AND WE HAVE NEW APPLIANCES."
524,ep164,AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH THE WAY IT LOOKS.
525,ep164,WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER IN THE KITCHEN OR THE LIVING ROOM.
526,ep164,(Suzanne) NIKKI AND WARREN ENJOY TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE SPACE THEIR NEW HOME AFFORDS THEM.
527,ep164,"THEIR BRIGHT, COMFORTABLE LIVING ROOM IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO RELAX ON WEEKENDS."
528,ep164,"PLUS, IT GIVES THEM THE SPACE THEY WANTED FOR ENTERTAINING."
529,ep164,AND THE COUPLE IS THRILLED TO HAVE GONE FROM A CLOSET-SIZED BEDROOM IN THEIR OLD RENTAL TO A FULL-SIZED MASTER BEDROOM IN THE NEW HOME.
530,ep164,THERE'S EVEN ANOTHER BEDROOM TO SPARE.
531,ep164,"THERE'S EXTRA ROOM OUTSIDE, TOO."
532,ep164,"A PRIVATE BACKYARD WAS A PRIORITY FOR THE DOWS, AND WARREN HAS ALREADY STARTED REDOING THE GARDEN."
533,ep164,(Nikki) HOW ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
534,ep164,PRETTY GOOD...
535,ep164,MAKING PROGRESS.
536,ep164,(Suzanne) NIKKI AND WARREN HAVE SETTLED COMFORTABLY INTO A HOME THAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.
537,ep164,WE FEEL THAT WE GOT REALLY LUCKY.
538,ep164,THERE'S NOT ONE FLAW IN OUR MINDS.
539,ep164,JUST EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.
540,ep164,"FROM THE YARD TO THE FIREPLACE, THE FLOORS, THE KITCHEN, EVERYTHING JUST KIND OF WORKED OUT."
541,ep164,WARREN AND NIKKI FEEL FORTUNATE THAT THEIR QUICK DECISION TO MAKE AN OFFER GOT THEM THE HOME THEY'D BEEN DREAMING ABOUT FOR YEARS.

10,ep165,"(Arthur) I KNEW IT WAS A FIXER-UPPER WHEN I BOUGHT IT, BUT I KIND OF HAD A FIGURE IN MY HEAD AND I WENT THROUGH THAT REALLY QUICK."
11,ep165,AND REALIZED IT WAS GONNA TAKE TWICE THAT AMOUNT TO GET THE HOUSE THE WAY I LIKED IT.
12,ep165,(Suzanne) ARTHUR'S BACKYARD IS ALSO A FIXER-UPPER.
13,ep165,AT 4000 SQUARE FEET THE GROUNDS ALONE REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL UPKEEP.
14,ep165,THIS IS AN ASPECT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH ARTHUR WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE UP.
15,ep165,"I'VE NOTICED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE I'VE HAD THE HOUSE, I HAVEN'T TRAVELED AS MUCH AS I LIKE TO AND DONE NEARLY AS MUCH OF THE STUFF AS I USED TO DO WHEN I WAS RENTING, BEFORE."
16,ep165,"AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE MY OWN PLACE, BUT MAYBE I DON'T NEED TO HAVE A PLACE THAT'S AS MUCH WORK."

24,ep165,I'M DOIN' OKAY...
25,ep165,HOW ARE YOU?
26,ep165,I'M GOOD.
27,ep165,(Suzanne) ARTHUR IS SO HAPPY IN HIS CURRENT NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HE'D REALLY LIKE TO STAY NEARBY.
28,ep165,"THIS MIGHT POSE A PROBLEM FOR HIM, HOWEVER, BECAUSE REAL ESTATE PRICES IN THE AREA ARE RISING QUICKLY."
29,ep165,"WHILE THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ARTHUR AS HE SELLS HIS CURRENT HOME, IT MIGHT BE AN OBSTACLE TO PURCHASING A NEW HOME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD."

34,ep165,"FOR INSTANCE, THE LAYOUT OF HIS HOME IS IDEAL FOR ENTERTAINING, WITH THE COMMON AREAS ON ONE FLOOR, AND THE BEDROOMS ON ANOTHER."
35,ep165,(Arthur) IT'S A COOL HOUSE TO HAVE PEOPLE OVER AND TO ENTERTAIN.
36,ep165,SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'LL MISS MOST ABOUT IT.
37,ep165,"AND THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS WHEN I START TO LOOK FOR A NEW HOUSE, IS THAT I HAVE TO HAVE A HOUSE WHERE YOU CAN ENTERTAIN."
38,ep165,"BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY NEED LARGE BEDROOMS OR LARGE BATHROOMS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT I DO LIKE A LARGE LIVING AREA AND A DECENT KITCHEN, AND SOME KIND OF PATIO AREA OR YARD WHERE YOU CAN HANG OUT..."

67,ep165,"OH, THE TOILET SEAT'S UP."
68,ep165,YEAH. TWO GUYS...
69,ep165,RIGHT. IMPORTANT TO KEEP THOSE CLOSED.

71,ep165,THAT MAKES SENSE.

73,ep165,"(Arthur) BASICALLY RIGHT NOW I'M NOT LOOKING, I'M WINDOW-SHOPPING."
74,ep165,"BECAUSE IF I GET INVOLVED WITH SEARCHING FOR A HOUSE, I'M NOT GONNA PAY ATTENTION TO SELLING THIS HOUSE."
75,ep165,"THE LARGEST OBSTACLE I FORESEE IN BUYING A NEW HOUSE IS PRICE, JUST BECAUSE IT'S A CRAZY REAL ESTATE MARKET."

116,ep165,"YEAH, AND THERE'S..."
117,ep165,DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S A FENCE BACK HERE FOR THE YARD.
118,ep165,NO. IT HAS KIND OF A STEEP BREAKAWAY DOWN THERE.
119,ep165,"RIGHT, RIGHT TO THE STREET."
120,ep165,YES. WHAT DO YOU THINK...
121,ep165,WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND LOOK AT THE BEDROOMS?

126,ep165,"OKAY. DISENCHANTED WITH THE HOMES HE'S SEEN SO FAR AND CONCERNED THAT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WITH ALL OF THE FEATURES HE WANTS WILL BE OUT OF HIS PRICE RANGE, ARTHUR DECIDES TO EXPLORE ANOTHER OPTION..."
127,ep165,CONDOMINIUMS. DAYS LATER ARTHUR AND LINDA TAKE A LOOK AT A CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX IN THE AREA.
128,ep165,A CONDO MIGHT HAVE THE SIZE HE WANTS WITHOUT THE OVERWHELMING UPKEEP OF A HOUSE.
129,ep165,"THIS IS ABOUT 1400 SQUARE FEET, AS I UNDERSTAND."
130,ep165,I'VE NOT SEEN THIS ONE YET.
131,ep165,THAT'S PRETTY LARGE.
132,ep165,"OH, IT'S NICE."
133,ep165,VERY NICE...
134,ep165,BEAUTIFUL WOOD FLOORS.
135,ep165,RIGHT. I LIKE THAT...
136,ep165,"CROWN MOLDINGS, FAUX FIREPLACE..."
137,ep165,THIS IS NICE.
138,ep165,"YEAH, IT'S NICE AND BRIGHT."
139,ep165,DOUBLE-HUNG WINDOWS...
140,ep165,"IT'S A BIG ROOM, TOO."
141,ep165,"YEAH, VERY NICE."
142,ep165,(Suzanne) ANOTHER PLUS IS THIS CONDO'S LOCATION NEAR ARTHUR'S PREFERRED NEIGHBORHOOD.
143,ep165,THIS IS A NICE LITTLE DINING ROOM.
144,ep165,A LITTLE DINING EL.
145,ep165,"OH, LOOK AT THESE, THESE BUILT-INS."
146,ep165,(Suzanne) THESE BUILT-INS ADD THE TYPE OF CHARM AND CHARACTER THAT ARTHUR IS LOOKING FOR.
147,ep165,THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM FOR ARTHUR'S TABLE AND LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT.
148,ep165,(Linda) VERY NICE.
149,ep165,"THE BALCONY IS OFF THE KITCHEN HERE, ARTHUR."
150,ep165,THIS KITCHEN'S SMALLER THAN MY LAST KITCHEN.
151,ep165,"YEAH, THAT IT IS."
152,ep165,AND THE BALCONY HERE...
153,ep165,"OH, THAT'S NOT REALLY MUCH OF A BALCONY."
154,ep165,"NO WAY TO, UH, CONFINE THE DOG THERE."
155,ep165,"YEAH, IT'S NOT VERY DOG-FRIENDLY."
156,ep165,"IT'S STILL REALLY NICE, THOUGH."
157,ep165,I LIKE THE KITCHEN.
158,ep165,"(Suzanne) DESPITE ITS SMALL SIZE, ARTHUR LIKES THE KITCHEN'S CHARM."
159,ep165,(Arthur) THIS MUST BE WHERE THE BEDROOMS ARE.
160,ep165,YES. AND BATH...
161,ep165,(Suzanne) THE MASTER BEDROOM IS MUCH BIGGER THAN ARTHUR'S CURRENT ROOM.
162,ep165,ALL OF HIS FURNITURE WOULD FIT HERE.
163,ep165,THE SECOND BEDROOM IS ALSO ROOMY.
164,ep165,IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR BARRY.
165,ep165,OKAY. IS NICE.
166,ep165,IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SMALL.
167,ep165,NO. GOOD-SIZE.
168,ep165,(Suzanne) THE CONDO HAS THE SPACE OF A HOUSE WITHOUT ALL THE MAINTENANCE.
169,ep165,ARTHUR LIKES THE OVERALL LAYOUT AND SIZE.
170,ep165,"DESPITE HIS MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE PATIO AND THE SPACE FOR HIS DOG, HE MUST FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE."
171,ep165,"NEEDING SOME TIME TO THINK, ARTHUR DECIDES TO SLEEP ON IT."
172,ep165,"OKAY, THIS IS FOR YOUR FILE."
173,ep165,(Suzanne) THE NEXT DAY ARTHUR DECIDES HE CAN MAKE CONDO LIVING WORK.
174,ep165,HE AND LINDA WRITE AN OFFER THEY THINK WILL BE EASILY ACCEPTED.
175,ep165,"ARTHUR IS TRYING TO COORDINATE MOVING OUT OF HIS OLD HOUSE TO MOVE RIGHT INTO THE NEW PLACE, BUT HE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO MAKE IT ALL WORK."
176,ep165,"(ring) AS THE CLOCK TICKS DOWN FOR ARTHUR'S MOVE-OUT DATE, HE WAITS ANXIOUSLY TO HEAR FROM LINDA ABOUT THE OFFER."
177,ep165,"HELLO? HI, LINDA."
178,ep165,"OH, NO..."
179,ep165,WHAT'S UP?
180,ep165,"OH, IT DID?"
181,ep165,(Suzanne) ARTHUR LEARNS SOMEONE ELSE HAS SUBMITTED A HIGHER OFFER.
182,ep165,"AS MUCH AS ARTHUR LIKES THE CONDO, HE FEELS THE PRICE IS NOW TOO STEEP."
183,ep165,"IN THIS CURRENT MARKET, SELLING HIS HOME WAS THE EASY PART, BUT BUYING HAS PROVEN MORE DIFFICULT."
184,ep165,"OKAY, THANKS..."
185,ep165,BYE-BYE. (Suzanne) TIME HAS RUN OUT FOR ARTHUR.
186,ep165,"ESCROW HAS CLOSED ON HIS OLD HOME, SO HE'S MOVING IN WITH A FRIEND."
187,ep165,"WHILE BECOMING A RENTER WASN'T PART OF ARTHUR'S PLANS, IT HAS FREED HIM FROM HOUSE-HUNTING UNDER A DEADLINE."
188,ep165,CAN YOU BRING ME THAT OTHER CHAIR?
189,ep165,SURE. HIS HOUSE-HUNTING NEEDS HAVE CHANGED TOO.
190,ep165,ARTHUR'S BROTHER AND ROOMMATE HAS MOVED AWAY TO PURSUE A JOB OPPORTUNITY.
191,ep165,NOW ARTHUR CAN TAKE THE TIME HE NEEDS TO FIND THE HOUSE HE WANTS.
192,ep165,PHEW! ARTHUR HAVE TO MAKE HIS TEMPORARY HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS PERMANENT?
193,ep165,OR IS HIS NEW PERFECT HOME JUST AROUND THE BEND?
194,ep165,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
195,ep165,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
196,ep165,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
197,ep165,ARTHUR PATTERSON HAD LITTLE TROUBLE SELLING HIS PREVIOUS HOME.
198,ep165,BUT HE'S FINDING THAT BUYING A NEW ONE IN A SELLER'S MARKET IS A DIFFICULT TASK.
199,ep165,OKAY. RUNNING OUT OF SPACE.
200,ep165,"(Suzanne) AFTER BEING OUTBID ON A CONDO, ARTHUR HAS TO FIND A TEMPORARY PLACE TO LIVE."
201,ep165,"WELL, THIS LOOKS LIKE WE GOT EVERYTHING."
202,ep165,"IT'LL STAY PUT FOR THE TIME BEING, TILL I FIND ANOTHER PLACE."
203,ep165,THANKS... DONE.
204,ep165,"(Suzanne) FOR NOW HE'S STAYING WITH A FRIEND, AND IS FOCUSING ON FINDING A NEW PLACE TO LIVE."
205,ep165,ARTHUR HEARS OF A HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S NOT EVEN ON THE MARKET YET.
206,ep165,BUT HIS REALTOR LINDA DIONISIO IS UNAVAILABLE AND CAN'T SHOW HIM THE HOUSE.
207,ep165,LINDA HAS ARRANGED FOR CHRIS LEESE TO SHOW ARTHUR THE HOME.
208,ep165,"ARTHUR KNOWS IF HE LIKES IT, HE'LL HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY."
209,ep165,SO THIS IS NICE.
210,ep165,"YES, IT IS."
211,ep165,CRAFTSMAN-STYLE HOUSE...
212,ep165,"BUNGALOW... BEDROOMS, TWO BATH?"
213,ep165,UH-HUH. THIS IS A GREAT ROOM.
214,ep165,"YEAH, IT IS."
215,ep165,YOU CAN TELL IT'S JUST BEEN PAINTED.
216,ep165,UH-HUH. HAS RECESSED LIGHTING.
217,ep165,AND A FIREPLACE...
218,ep165,I HAVEN'T HAD A FIREPLACE IN AGES.
219,ep165,"YEAH, A WORKING FIREPLACE."
220,ep165,IT'S VERY PRETTY...
221,ep165,I WANNA SEE THE KITCHEN.
222,ep165,ALL RIGHT.
223,ep165,"WELL, THIS IS A NICE KITCHEN."
224,ep165,"YEAH, YOU CAN TELL THEY TOTALLY REMODELED THIS HOUSE."
225,ep165,"MM-HMM. I LIKE THE CABINETS, THEY'RE DECENT."
226,ep165,"AND THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH OF THEM, TOO."
227,ep165,MM-HMM. TILE COUNTERTOPS INSTEAD OF FORMICA...
228,ep165,THAT'S A PLUS.
229,ep165,YEAH. THERE'S A DISHWASHER HERE AS WELL.
230,ep165,YEAH. DIDN'T HAVE ONE AT YOUR OLD PLACE.
231,ep165,"NO. THAT WAS A DRAG, TOO..."
232,ep165,SO I KINDA LIKE THAT.
233,ep165,AND YOU COULD PUT A STACKABLE WASHER AND DRYER HERE.
234,ep165,"AND I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BUY A STOVE, TOO."
235,ep165,"YEAH. THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM, 'CAUSE THEN I CAN GET ONE THAT I WANT."
236,ep165,"WELL, LET'S GO OUT ON THE DECK."
237,ep165,ALL RIGHT.
238,ep165,THIS IS A GREAT DECK FOR ENTERTAINING.
239,ep165,"YEAH. LOVE THE VIEW, TOO."
240,ep165,YEAH. NICE.
241,ep165,LET ME LOOK DOWN OVER HERE.
242,ep165,HAS A BIT OF A BACKYARD FOR YOUR DOG.
243,ep165,"YEAH, BUT IT'S LOW- MAINTENANCE ENOUGH."
244,ep165,IT'S NOT LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO MUCH GARDENING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
245,ep165,NOT AT ALL.
246,ep165,"WOW, THIS IS GREAT."
247,ep165,LET'S CHECK THE REST OUT.
248,ep165,OKAY. NICE.
249,ep165,THAT DECK REALLY WOULD BE GREAT FOR ENTERTAINING.
250,ep165,"YEAH. IT'S PRETTY NEW, TOO, SO IT'S NOT GONNA NEED A LOT OF UPKEEP FOR A LONG TIME."
251,ep165,THIS MUST BE THE FULL BATHROOM OF THE TWO.
252,ep165,YEAH. NICE AND BRIGHT IN HERE.
253,ep165,"YEAH... GOT A FULL-SIZE TUB, TOO."
254,ep165,I LIKE IT.
255,ep165,LET'S CHECK OUT THE BEDROOM.
256,ep165,THIS IS A NICE-SIZE ROOM.
257,ep165,"YEAH, IT IS."
258,ep165,"I LIKE THE TWO WINDOWS, TOO..."
259,ep165,IT OPENS IT UP.
260,ep165,(Suzanne) THE MASTER BEDROOM HAS LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT.
261,ep165,"WITH DETAILS LIKE CROWN MOLDING, WIDE BASEBOARDS, AND HARDWOOD FLOORS, THIS IS A HOME THAT ARTHUR CAN SEE HIMSELF LIVING IN."
262,ep165,LET ME LOOK AT THE CLOSET.
263,ep165,"AH, NICE SIZE."
264,ep165,COOL. CHECK OUT THE OTHER BEDROOM...
265,ep165,"I LIKE THIS ONE, THOUGH."
266,ep165,"THIS WOULD BE THE MASTER BEDROOM, PROBABLY."
267,ep165,YEAH. THIS IS THE SECOND BEDROOM.
268,ep165,"YEAH. NOT AS BIG AS THE OTHER ONE, BUT IT'D BE A GOOD OFFICE."
269,ep165,"YEAH, IT WOULD..."
270,ep165,"OR A SINGLE-BED GUEST ROOM, SOMETHING LIKE THAT..."
271,ep165,"SURE. CLOSET, THOUGH..."
272,ep165,IT'S NOT BAD.
273,ep165,"AND IS THIS WHERE THE SECOND BATHROOM IS, DO YOU THINK?"
274,ep165,YEAH. THIS OUT...
275,ep165,SO THIS IS THE GUEST BATHROOM.
276,ep165,YEAH. STALL SHOWER...
277,ep165,THAT'S FINE.
278,ep165,IT'S ALL YOU NEED FOR A GUEST.
279,ep165,PERFECT. THERE IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
280,ep165,I KINDA LIKE IT...
281,ep165,IN EVERY ROOM THERE IS HERE.
282,ep165,"DEFINITELY, THIS HOUSE HAS A LOT OF CHARACTER."
283,ep165,(Suzanne) THE HOUSE SEEMS LIKE A PERFECT FIT.
284,ep165,IT HAS A GREAT OUTDOOR ENTERTAINING AREA WITH BEAUTIFUL VIEWS.
285,ep165,AND THE YARD IS BIG ENOUGH FOR ARTHUR'S DOG BUT REQUIRES LITTLE MAINTENANCE.
286,ep165,INSIDE THERE ARE QUALITY UPGRADES LIKE TILE COUNTERTOPS AND NEW CABINETRY IN THE KITCHEN.
287,ep165,"ORIGINAL HARDWARE-LIKE DOORKNOBS, CABINET LATCHES, AND VENT REGISTERS ADD CHARACTER TO THE HOME."
288,ep165,AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS ARTHUR'S DREAM OF A FIREPLACE.
289,ep165,I LIKE THIS HOUSE.
290,ep165,"YEAH, IT'S REALLY A GREAT PROPERTY."
291,ep165,YOU CAN TELL THEY PUT SOME TIME INTO IT YEAH.
292,ep165,ON THE INSIDE...
293,ep165,MM-HMM. IT'S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TOO.
294,ep165,IT'S KINDA WHAT I'M LOOKIN' FOR.
295,ep165,"AND THE YARD AS WELL, I THINK THEY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB ON IT."
296,ep165,"YEAH, IT'S IN SHAPE."
297,ep165,YOU KNOW WHAT...
298,ep165,"I WANT TO TALK TO LINDA, 'CAUSE I THINK I WANT TO PLACE AN OFFER."
299,ep165,YOU THINK IT'S WHAT I NEED?
300,ep165,CERTAINLY... AHEAD AND GIVE HER A CALL.
301,ep165,"YOU LIKE IT, THOUGH?"
302,ep165,I LIKE THIS PLACE A LOT.
303,ep165,'CAUSE YOU SAW THE LAST HOUSE.
304,ep165,"OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA GIVE HER A CALL THEN, AND SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO."
305,ep165,ALL RIGHT.
306,ep165,"WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, WILL ARTHUR GET THE HOUSE?"
307,ep165,OR IS IT JUST TOO TOUGH TO BUY IN A SELLER'S MARKET?
308,ep165,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
309,ep165,"AFTER SELLING HIS HOUSE IN A BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET, ARTHUR PATTERSON IS NOW FACING OVERINFLATED PRICES AND MULTIPLE OFFERS AS A HOMEBUYER."
310,ep165,"CURRENTLY RENTING A ROOM AT A FRIEND'S HOME, ARTHUR HAS MADE AN OFFER ON A HOUSE THROUGH HIS REALTOR LINDA DIONISIO."
311,ep165,"THE HOUSE HAS EVERYTHING ARTHUR WANTED, BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK OVERSEAS HAS COME UP, AND HE'S BEGINNING TO HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT BUYING."
312,ep165,"OH, HELLO..."
313,ep165,I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMEBODY PULL UP.
314,ep165,HI. ARE YOU?
315,ep165,"GOOD, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?"
316,ep165,I'M FINE.
317,ep165,GOOD TO SEE YOU.
318,ep165,WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?
319,ep165,"WELL, I HAD TO BE OVER ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN."
320,ep165,AND SINCE WE PUT THE OFFER IN...
321,ep165,"WE HAVE A COUNTEROFFER, AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MULTIPLE OFFERS ON THE PROPERTY."
322,ep165,SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'LL GET IT?
323,ep165,"WELL, IT MEANS THAT WE COULD GET INTO A BIDDING WAR, POSSIBLY, AND THE PROPERTY COULD POTENTIALLY GO ABOVE THE ASKING PRICE."
324,ep165,MM. FOR ARTHUR THAT'S ALL HE NEEDS TO HEAR.
325,ep165,"AS MUCH AS HE LIKED THE HOUSE, HE'S UNWILLING TO PAY A PRICE HE FEELS IS TOO HIGH."
326,ep165,"AND WITH HIS NEW JOB OPPORTUNITY, ARTHUR'S PRIORITIES HAVE CHANGED."
327,ep165,HE DECIDES NOT TO PROCEED ANY FURTHER WITH HIS HOUSE SEARCH.
328,ep165,AND YOU WOULDN'T BE UPSET WITH THAT?
329,ep165,"OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT."
330,ep165,OKAY. I'LL DO IS I WILL CONTACT THE LISTING AGENT TO LET HIM KNOW oF YOUR WISHes NOT TO RESPOND TO THE COUNTER.
331,ep165,I DOUBT THAT HE'LL BE UPSET BECAUSE OF HAVING SEVERAL OFFERS IN HAND.
332,ep165,"RIGHT, HE'S GOT IT PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW."
333,ep165,"WELL, THANKS FOR STOPPING BY."
334,ep165,YOU BET...
335,ep165,I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
336,ep165,"ALL RIGHT, BYE BYE-BYE NOW."
337,ep165,TAKE CARE.
338,ep165,YOU TOO.
339,ep165,(Suzanne) IT'S OFFICIAL...
340,ep165,ARTHUR HAS CALLED A HALT TO HIS SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME.
341,ep165,FOR ABOUT THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS THIS HOUSE HUNTING HAS KIND OF BEEN THE FRONT BURNER OF EVERYTHING.
342,ep165,"I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR PLACES, I'VE BEEN SELLING MY HOUSE, I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH REALTORS AND ALL THE OTHER PAPERWORK THAT'S INVOLVED IN THAT."
343,ep165,"(Suzanne) NOW THAT THOSE HEADACHES ARE GONE, ARTHUR HAS DISCOVERED SOME UNEXPECTED JOYS OF RENTING."
344,ep165,HE HAS THE SPACE HE WANTED WITHOUT THE CONCERNS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP.
345,ep165,"PLUS ARTHUR NOT ONLY ENJOYS THE CHARMING SURROUNDINGS OF HIS FRIEND'S HOME, BUT ALSO THE NEWFOUND FREEDOM THAT COMES WITH HIS LIFESTYLE CHANGE."
346,ep165,(Arthur) SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED WHILE SEARCHING FOR A HOUSE AND ALSO SELLING MY HOUSE ARE WHAT I NEED AND WHAT I DON'T NEED.
347,ep165,"AND I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO ONE WORD, WHICH IS, BASICALLY, RESPONSIBILITY."
348,ep165,"I'M GLAD FOR THE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD A HOUSE, AND I LIVED IN IT AND I FIXED IT UP A LITTLE AND I KNEW WHAT THAT AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IS LIKE."
349,ep165,"BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I KINDA WOULD LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE."
350,ep165,"(Suzanne) WHILE ENJOYING HIS FREEDOM, ARTHUR SEES NO REASON NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OFFER TO WORK OVERSEAS."
351,ep165,HE DECIDES TO DO IT.
352,ep165,I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I'M NOT EVEN GONNA BE HERE.
353,ep165,I'M GONNA BE GONE WORKING AND TRAVELING AND JUST KIND OF EXPERIENCING THINGS THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE IN MY LIFE.
354,ep165,"AND SIX MONTHS AGO, TO SAY THAT I WOULD BE DOING THIS, I WOULD NEVER HAD BELIEVED IT, BECAUSE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SELLING THE HOUSE, AND SEARCHING FOR A NEW HOUSE, AND STAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND WORKING AT THE HOME OFFICE."
355,ep165,SO IT'S REALLY...
356,ep165,IT'S EXCITING.
357,ep165,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH ARTHUR DIDN'T FIND A HOUSE, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED OUT WELL FOR HIM."
358,ep165,(Arthur) IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT A HOUSE.
359,ep165,BUT I'M LOOKIN' FORWARD TO TRYIN' SOMETHING NEW FOR A WHILE.
360,ep165,ARTHUR'S SEARCH DIDN'T END THE WAY HE EXPECTED IT WOULD.
361,ep165,"INSTEAD, HE DISCOVERED THAT FINDING A HOME DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN BUYING A HOUSE."
362,ep165,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
363,ep165,THANKS FOR WATCHING.

366,ep165,♪♪
546,ep165,WELCOME TO
1,ep166,SUZANNE WHANG.
2,ep166,WELCOME TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
3,ep166,"AFTER NEARLY TWO YEARS OF MARRIAGE, AMY AND MARK BRADFORD ARE READY TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS."
4,ep166,"CURRENTLY APARTMENT DWELLERS, THIS YOUNG COUPLE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO LIVING IN A HOME OF THEIR OWN."
5,ep166,BUT THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING ONE THEY CAN AFFORD IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LIKE.
6,ep166,WILL THE BRADFORDS FIND A HOME WITHOUT COMPROMISING THEIR DREAM?
7,ep166,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep166,"♪♪ ♪♪ MARK AND AMY BRADFORD ARE NEWLY MARRIED AND ANXIOUS TO LEAVE APARTMENT LIVING BEHIND, IN FAVOR OF A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME."
9,ep166,"(Mark Bradford) WE'VE LIVED IN THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX TOGETHER FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF, AND THAT WAS WHEN WE GOT MARRIED, AND WE GOT INTO A TWO BEDROOM."
10,ep166,"AND WE LIKE THIS PLACE FOR AN APARTMENT-- IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE, AND THE RENT IS VERY GOOD-- BUT JUST NOT SATISFIED LONG TERM WITH IT."
11,ep166,"(Suzanne) PART OF THE COUPLE'S LONG-TERM PLAN INVOLVES RAISING A BIG FAMILY, SO A GOOD-SIZED HOUSE WITH EXTRA ROOMS IS WHAT AMY AND MARK ARE LOOKING FOR."
12,ep166,WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT MOVING WHEN WE DECIDED TO HAVE CHILDREN.
13,ep166,"AND THIS PLACE IS PERFECT FOR JUST THE TWO OF US, BUT WE ARE PLANNING ON EXPANDING, SO WE'D LIKE A BIGGER PLACE."
14,ep166,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH THEIR CURRENT LIVING ARRANGEMENTS HAVE SERVED THEIR NEEDS SO FAR, THERE IS A DOWNSIDE TO LIVING IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX."
15,ep166,"I REALLY LIKE OUR NEIGHBORS, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZE HOW WILD THEY ARE UP THERE."
16,ep166,SO I'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO GET RID OF UPSTAIRS NEIGHBORS.
17,ep166,"WELL, I DO MOST OF THE COOKING, AND A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE-- IT'S A LITTLE BIT SMALL FOR ME."
18,ep166,I LIKE MORE SPACE.
19,ep166,AND THERE ISN'T REALLY A LOT OF STORAGE FOR PUTTING ENOUGH POTS AND PANS AND ALL THE DISHES.
20,ep166,"SO IT ENDS UP BEING ON THE COUNTER, AND THAT GIVES A CLUTTERED FEELING."
21,ep166,"AND I LIKE A BIGGER KITCHEN WITH MORE CLEAN, CLEAR COUNTER SPACE."
22,ep166,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH THE BRADFORDS' LIVING ROOM IS SPACIOUS, IT'S HAD TO DOUBLE AS A STUDY ROOM FOR AMY, WHO IS A PART-TIME STUDENT, BECAUSE OF THE APARTMENT'S LACK OF SQUARE FOOTAGE."
23,ep166,"IN ADDITION TO WANTING MORE SPACE INSIDE, HAVING MORE ROOM OUTSIDE IS ALSO AN ISSUE."
24,ep166,WE CURRENTLY HAVE A REALLY CUTE LITTLE PATIO AREA THAT I LIKE.
25,ep166,"HOWEVER, I'D LIKE TO HAVE A YARD SOMEDAY."
26,ep166,AND I KNOW...
27,ep166,"IT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE, BUT I WOULD REALLY, REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A YARD."
28,ep166,(Suzanne) BUT THE PRIME CONCERN FOR THE BRADFORDS IS WANTING TO HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR A NEW FAMILY.
29,ep166,"(Mark) BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING KIDS, WE JUST DECIDED WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE IN MOVING INTO A PLACE THAT WE WOULD BE FORCED TO MOVE OUT OF IF WE HAD KIDS."
30,ep166,SO WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE DECIDED WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN STAY IN FOR 10 TO 15 YEARS.
31,ep166,"(Suzanne) A HOUSE, NOT A CONDO, A LARGER KITCHEN, A LIGHT AND AIRY LIVING ROOM, A BIG BACKYARD AND MORE BEDROOMS..."
32,ep166,"ALL OF THESE ARE HIGH ON THEIR WISH LIST, ALONG WITH..."
33,ep166,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!"
34,ep166,(Suzanne) AND THAT'S WHERE REALTOR NICK PETERS COMES INTO PLAY.
35,ep166,"A FRIEND OF THE COUPLE, NICK WAS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE TO HELP THE BRADFORDS FILL THIS TALL ORDER."
36,ep166,"(Nick Peters) THEY REALLY WANT THE CLASSIC HOME WITH THE BARBECUE BACKYARD AND THE PICKET-FENCE FRONT YARD, AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR."
37,ep166,"I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED, GIVEN THE PRICE RANGE THEY WANT TO BUY IN, THE AREA THEY WANT, AND THE SIZE OF THE HOME AND THE YARD."
38,ep166,"I MEAN, THAT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH THING TO FIND."
39,ep166,"(Suzanne) AFTER A MORE LENGTHY CONVERSATION WITH THE BRADFORDS, NICK WAS ABLE TO HELP MARK AND AMY COME TO SOME REALIZATIONS ABOUT THE HOUSES THEY ARE CONSIDERING."
40,ep166,"THAT AREA, YOU'RE RIGHT."
41,ep166,"IT'S GOT SOME REALLY NEAT HOMES, AND THERE'S NICE BLOCKS..."
42,ep166,I KNOW THAT AREA.
43,ep166,"BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF IS YOU'RE NOT JUST BUYING A HOME, OR EVEN A STREET."
44,ep166,YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUYING A COMMUNITY.
45,ep166,"(Mark) ONE OF THE THINGS OUR REALTOR BROUGHT TO MIND WAS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT LOCATIONS, WHERE WOULD AMY OR MYSELF-- BUT AMY PRIMARILY-- BE GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE, GOING TO GO RENT A MOVIE?"
46,ep166,THAT REALLY CHANGED THE WAY THAT I LOOKED AT A NEIGHBORHOOD.
47,ep166,"(Suzanne) THE TROUBLE IS, THE HOMES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS MARK AND AMY LIKE THE MOST ARE NOT IN THEIR BUDGET."
48,ep166,"NICK SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A LESS EXPENSIVE CONDOMINIUM IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT AMY, IN PARTICULAR, HAS HER HEART SET ON OWNING A HOUSE."
49,ep166,THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT A CONDO DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME AT ALL.
50,ep166,"SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT A CONDO WITH ME, SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT A CONDO WITH ME, NO."
51,ep166,NO. SHE THINKS IT'S GONNA BE JUST LIKE LIVING IN THE APARTMENT.
52,ep166,"(Suzanne) WANTING THE BRADFORDS TO EXPLORE ALL THEIR OPTIONS, NICK DOES SOME RESEARCH AND FINDS SEVERAL OF THE BEST HOUSES AND THE BEST CONDOS WITHIN THEIR RANGE, SO THE BRADFORDS CAN DO SOME COMPARATIVE SHOPPING."
53,ep166,THE BRADFORDS HAVE REACHED AN IMPASSE.
54,ep166,"THEIR HEARTS ARE SET ON A HOUSE, WHILE THEIR BUDGET IS GEARED TOWARD A CONDO."
55,ep166,CAN THEY FIND A HAPPY MEDIUM...
56,ep166,STAY TUNED.
57,ep166,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
58,ep166,"AFTER A LENGTHY DISCUSSION WITH MARK AND AMY BRADFORD, REALTOR NICK PETERS HAS COME UP WITH A LIST OF CONDOS AND HOMES FOR THE COUPLE TO SEE."
59,ep166,NOW IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHAT THE BEST OPTION IS.
60,ep166,"(Nick) NOW REMEMBER, THIS IS PART OF THE RULING-OUT PROCESS."
61,ep166,RIGHT... GONNA SEE A CONDO.
62,ep166,AND WE'RE REALLY AT PROBABLY THE NICEST CONDO COMPLEX IN THE AREA.
63,ep166,SO THERE'S A HUGE BALCONY THAT WRAPS AROUND ALL THE WAY AROUND IT.
64,ep166,THAT WRAPS AROUND ALL THE WAY AROUND IT.
65,ep166,"OH, THAT'S COOL."
66,ep166,"OH, THAT'S COOL."
67,ep166,"THIS IS A FIRST FLOOR CONDO, SO THAT MEANS BENEATH YOU IS THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE, AND UPSTAIRS ARE OTHER UNITS."
68,ep166,(Amy) THERE IS PEOPLE ABOVE ME?
69,ep166,(Amy) THERE IS PEOPLE ABOVE ME?
70,ep166,"YEAH, IT'S ONE LEVEL."
71,ep166,"YEAH, IT'S ONE LEVEL."
72,ep166,AND THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO LEVELS ABOVE YOU.
73,ep166,SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE MY APARTMENT NOW.
74,ep166,AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN.
75,ep166,AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE KITCHEN.
76,ep166,OKAY. THIS IS INTERESTING.
77,ep166,"IT'S CUTE, BUT IT'S SMALL."
78,ep166,IT IS A LITTLE BIT TIGHT.
79,ep166,BUT IT'S CUTE...
80,ep166,I LIKE IT.
81,ep166,"(Nick) OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BEDROOMS."
82,ep166,"REMEMBER, IT'S A TWO BEDROOM, TWO BATH CONDO."
83,ep166,"IT HAS NINE-FOOT CEILINGS, WHICH IS NICE."
84,ep166,"AND AGAIN, BECAUSE IT'S AN END UNIT, YOU HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT COMING INTO THE BEDROOM."
85,ep166,IT'S A GOOD SIZE.
86,ep166,IT'S NICE.
87,ep166,AND HERE IS YOUR MASTER BATHROOM.
88,ep166,"IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK, BUT IT'S GOOD SIZED."
89,ep166,BUT IT'S GOOD SIZED.
90,ep166,(Amy) DUAL SINKS!
91,ep166,(Amy) DUAL SINKS!
92,ep166,"THERE YOU GO, MARK, YOU HAVE YOUR SINKS!"
93,ep166,YEAH. LIKE IT...
94,ep166,THIS IS VERY NICE.
95,ep166,"OKAY, SO THE TOUR IS OVER."
96,ep166,I GUESS THE QUESTION NOW IS...
97,ep166,"AGAIN, THIS IS PROBABLY THE NICEST COMPLEX WE'RE GONNA SEE IN YOUR TARGET PRICE RANGE."
98,ep166,SO ARE CONDOS STILL ON THE LIST AS HOMES TO SEE?
99,ep166,I DON'T THINK SO.
100,ep166,I DON'T THINK SO.
101,ep166,NO. WITH THE GROUNDS?
102,ep166,EVEN WITH THE GROUNDS?
103,ep166,"THE GROUNDS ARE BEAUTIFUL, THE GROUNDS ARE BEAUTIFUL, BUT THIS PLACE STILL FEELS LIKE APARTMENT LIVING."
104,ep166,"(Suzanne) AFTER SEEING THIS SPACE, THE BRADFORDS ARE ALL THE MORE DETERMINED TO FIND A HOUSE."
105,ep166,"SO NICK TAKES THEM TO THE NEXT STOP ON HIS SHOPPING LIST, A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME IN THE SAME COMMUNITY."
106,ep166,"IT'S JUST GOT A ONE CAR GARAGE, THOUGH."
107,ep166,LOOK AT ALL THE FLOWERS.
108,ep166,THIS IS NICE...
109,ep166,IT'S PRETTY.
110,ep166,(Suzanne) BUT THE HOUSE IS LOCATED NEAR A MAJOR BOULEVARD WITH A LOT OF BUSY TRAFFIC.
111,ep166,IT HAS NEW CARPET AND PAINT.
112,ep166,IT'S KIND OF NICE.
113,ep166,HERE'S THE LIVING ROOM.
114,ep166,"THERE'S NO FAMILY ROOM, SO THIS'LL BE YOUR MAIN ROOM."
115,ep166,"I KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE MOSTLY TO SEE THE KITCHEN AND THE YARD, SO LET'S GO THIS WAY."
116,ep166,THE KITCHEN LEADS RIGHT OUT TO THE YARD.
117,ep166,THE KITCHEN LEADS RIGHT OUT TO THE YARD.
118,ep166,OKAY. DO YOU THINK?
119,ep166,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
120,ep166,IT'S A LITTLE SMALL.
121,ep166,IT'S A LITTLE SMALL.
122,ep166,IT'S CUTE.
123,ep166,I LIKE THAT WINDOW.
124,ep166,YOU CAN SEE ALL THE BACKYARD.
125,ep166,YOU CAN SEE ALL THE BACKYARD.
126,ep166,"YEAH, THAT'S NICE."

128,ep166,THERE'S NO APPLIANCES HERE AT ALL.
129,ep166,"RIGHT, THERE'S NO BUILT-INS."
130,ep166,"RIGHT, THERE'S NO BUILT-INS."
131,ep166,I DON'T SEE ANY.
132,ep166,I DON'T SEE ANY.
133,ep166,"WELL, LET'S SEE THE YARD."

136,ep166,WOW! MY GOODNESS.
137,ep166,"OH, MY GOODNESS."
138,ep166,THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
139,ep166,THIS IS A GOOD- SIZE YARD.
140,ep166,CAN YOU SEE HOW ALL THE HOMES AROUND ARE ONE STORY?
141,ep166,SO YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD PRIVACY.
142,ep166,SO YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD PRIVACY.
143,ep166,THIS IS GREAT.
144,ep166,THIS IS GREAT.
145,ep166,"WELL, LET'S GO BACK, THEN, AND SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE."
146,ep166,AND SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
147,ep166,"OKAY. EVEN THOUGH THE BACKYARD IS SPACIOUS, WITH ONLY TWO BEDROOMS, THIS HOUSE IS SMALLER THAN THE COUPLE WOULD LIKE."
148,ep166,"AFTER LOCATION, LOTS OF ROOM IS NEXT ON MARK AND AMY'S WISH LIST."
149,ep166,"AND WHILE THE NEXT HOUSE NICK HAS FOUND FOR THEM TO LOOK AT HAS THE SPACE, IT'S GOING TO NEED SOME FIXING UP."
150,ep166,"OKAY, MARKO."
151,ep166,"OKAY, MARKO."
152,ep166,YEAH. REMINDER...
153,ep166,"YOU TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WANTING TO MAYBE TAKE ON A PROJECT."
154,ep166,WANTING TO MAYBE TAKE ON A PROJECT.
155,ep166,RIGHT. KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE WALK THROUGH.
156,ep166,IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.
157,ep166,IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.
158,ep166,"YEAH. DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL, THOUGH."
159,ep166,IT'S A GOOD LIVING SPACE HERE.
160,ep166,"AND YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO DO A LITTLE WORK, RIGHT?"
161,ep166,"WELL, IT LOOKS SO FAR LIKE IT'D BE A PROJECT."
162,ep166,"YEAH, IT WOULD."

168,ep166,"YEAH, THIS IS GREAT."
169,ep166,"YEAH, THIS IS GREAT."
170,ep166,IT LOOKS LIKE IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK.
171,ep166,IT SURE DOES.
172,ep166,"ALSO, THE KITCHEN GOES OUT TO THE BACKYARD, SO THIS IS KIND OF NICE."
173,ep166,(Mark) THIS IS GREAT.
174,ep166,IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE.
175,ep166,IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN THE LAST ONE.
176,ep166,"YEAH, IT IS."

181,ep166,YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE.
182,ep166,YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE.
183,ep166,UH-HUH. SO THERE YOU GO.

186,ep166,"WELL, I GOTTa TELL YOU THAT I DID SAY I WANTED TO SEE A PROJECT, BUT THIS REALLY, TO BE HONEST, IS TOO MUCH OF A PROJECT FOR ME."
187,ep166,I FEEL LIKE IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
188,ep166,"BUT IF YOU WERE WILLING TO, YOU KNOW, GET A BUNCH OF GUYS TOGETHER TO HELP ME DO THE WORK!"
189,ep166,"NO, LET'S NOT GO THERE!"
190,ep166,WE'LL FIND A DIFFERENT SOLUTION.
191,ep166,"YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T COME UP THAT OFTEN, BUT EVERY SO OFTEN A TOWNHOME WILL COME UP, LIKE AN END UNIT THAT FEELS PRETTY PRIVATE."
192,ep166,TRUST ME ON THIS!
193,ep166,"SOMETIMES ONE DOES COME UP, THERE'S A YARD ATTACHED OR TO THE SIDE OF IT, AND IT HAS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."
194,ep166,"AND QUITE FRANKLY, THERE'S MORE SPACE IN THOSE, IF IT'S A TOWNHOME, NOT A HOME."
195,ep166,IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE APARTMENT LIVING STILL.
196,ep166,"IF IT'S THE RIGHT SETUP, IT ISN'T."
197,ep166,"(Suzanne) AT THIS POINT, THE BRADFORDS DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT ANY OPTION THAT NICK THINKS MIGHT WORK."
198,ep166,"SO IF A TOWNHOUSE COMES ON THE MARKET, AMY AGREES, SHE'LL TAKE A LOOK."
199,ep166,"WE'LL FIND IT, HON."
200,ep166,"(Suzanne) UP NEXT, CAN NICK FIND THE PERFECT HOME FOR THE DISILLUSIONED HOUSE HUNTERS?"

203,ep166,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
204,ep166,"AFTER LOOKING AT JUST ONE CONDOMINIUM, AMY AND MARK BRADFORD HAVE DECIDED THAT IT FEELS TOO MUCH LIKE APARTMENT LIVING."
205,ep166,"AND EVEN THOUGH THE COUPLE HAS THEIR HEART SET ON A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME, THE HOUSES THEY'VE SEEN IN THEIR PRICE RANGE HAVE NOT BEEN RIGHT FOR THEIR NEEDS."
206,ep166,"SO THEIR REALTOR, NICK PETERS, COMES UP WITH ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE-- A ROOMY TOWNHOUSE LOCATED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH GREAT APPEAL."
207,ep166,"AMY, REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID YARD WAS REALLY IMPORTANT, AND YOU SAID TOWNHOMES PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN?"
208,ep166,AND YOU SAID TOWNHOMES PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN?

424,ep166,IT'S JUST PERFECT.
425,ep166,"INITIALLY, WE WERE LOOKING FOR A HOUSE, AND THEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH NICK OUR REALTOR, STARTED LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS, AND FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING THAT MET ALL OF OUR NEEDS."
426,ep166,"THE HOUSE SITUATION WASN'T WORKING FOR US-- EITHER IT WAS LOCATION, OR IT WAS COST FOR WHAT WE WANTED."
427,ep166,"AND WITH THIS PLACE, IT WORKED PERFECT."

430,ep166,ABOUT NEIGHBORS.
431,ep166,"NOISE. FOR THE REPAIRING-- SOME OF THE PLACES WE WERE LOOKING AT NEEDED A LOT OF REPAIRS, AND THIS WAS MOVE-IN."

433,ep166,WE DIDN'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING FOR IT.
434,ep166,"WE JUST MOVED IN AND MOVED OUR STUFF IN, AND IT'S LIVABLE."
435,ep166,"I GONNA MAKE EGGS, HONEY..."
436,ep166,HOW MANY DO YOU WANT?
437,ep166,"THREE. THE KITCHEN WAS IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE I WANTED SOMETHING..."
438,ep166,"FIRST OF ALL, COUNTER SPACE IS A BIG DEAL WITH ME, AND OUR KITCHEN HERE HAS A PANTRY THAT ALLOWED US TO PUT A LOT OF THINGS INTO ONE SPECIFIC AREA AND KEEP THE COUNTERS FREE."
439,ep166,AND IT'S CERTAINLY GOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR BOTH US TO BE IN THERE NOW.
440,ep166,"IT WAS TOO SQUASHED FOR TWO PEOPLE TO BE IN THE KITCHEN BEFORE, AND NOW WE HAVE ROOM."
441,ep166,"I WANTED A PLACE FOR MY DESK, SO I COULD DO BILLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT COMFORTABLY."
442,ep166,"AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE ENOUGH SPACE HERE FOR THAT, FOR ME TO HAVE MY DESK AND MY COMPUTER AND BE ABLE TO DO ALL MY PAPERWORK AND BOOKS, AND HAVE IT NOT BE CLUTTERED, HAVE IT NOT LOOK LIKE A REC ROOM OR A PLACE THAT WE JUST PUT JUNK IN."
443,ep166,SO IT'S WORKED OUT REALLY WELL.
444,ep166,"(Suzanne) WHILE AMY AND MARK BOTH ADMIT THAT THE HOME-BUYING PROCESS WAS STRESSFUL AT TIMES, THEY BOTH CREDIT THE SAME THING-- OR IN THIS CASE, THE SAME PERSON, WITH MAKING THEIR HOUSE HUNTING MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE IN THE END."
445,ep166,"IT'S ALL ABOUT A REALTOR WHO ASKS REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS, BECAUSE IT'S A JOURNEY, AND IT'S A WAY FOR YOU TO FIND OUT THINGS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW."
446,ep166,"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT, AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR FIVE YEARS FROM NOW."
447,ep166,AND I DON'T THINK WE WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND A PLACE AS GOOD AS THIS WITHOUT TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.
448,ep166,"YEAH, TRUST YOUR REALTOR."
449,ep166,"NOW THAT THEY'VE SETTLED INTO A NEW HOME WITH PLENTY OF ROOM, MARK AND AMY ARE READY TO START THE FAMILY THEY'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF HAVING."
450,ep166,I'M SUZANNE WHANG...
451,ep166,THANKS FOR WATCHING.

454,ep166,♪♪
1,ep167,HOUSE HUNTERS...
2,ep167,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep167,KEN AND JAYE KOPP HAVE BEEN LIVING IN A SMALL RENTAL HOUSE WITH A BIG YARD.
4,ep167,"THAT USED TO BE JUST THE WAY THEY WANTED IT, BUT NOW THEIR PRIORITIES HAVE CHANGED."
5,ep167,KEN AND JAYE WOULD LIKE TO TRADE THEIR SPACIOUS YARD FOR A MORE SPACIOUS HOUSE.
6,ep167,"BOTH ARE FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS, AND THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT REAL ESTATE."
7,ep167,WHAT HURDLES WILL KEN AND JAYE FACE?
8,ep167,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
9,ep167,♪♪ THIS TWO-BEDROOM RENTAL HAS BEEN HOME TO KEN AND JAYE KOPP FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.
10,ep167,"AT FIRST, THE HOUSE SEEMED IDEAL FOR THEM."
11,ep167,"IT WAS TERRIFIC FINDING IT, 'CAUSE IT HAD ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN A HOUSE."
12,ep167,"SO IT HAD THE DETACHED GARAGE AND THE LARGE DECK AND THE LARGE YARD, AND IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH FOR US THEN."
13,ep167,"(Suzanne) WHEN JAYE AND KEN FIRST MOVED IN, THEY LIKED SPENDING THEIR LEISURE TIME ON HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS."
14,ep167,THEY RENOVATED THEIR OLD POTTING SHED AND FILLED THEIR YARD WITH NEW LANDSCAPING.
15,ep167,"WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN HERE, THE YARD NEEDED A LOT OF WORK, AND SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND PUT IN A LAWN AND ALL THE ROSES AND ALL THE BEDDING PLANTS AND THINGS, AND IT BECAME REALLY, REALLY BEAUTIFUL."
16,ep167,(Suzanne) KEN ALSO PLANTED AN HERB GARDEN AND FRUIT TREES TO PROVIDE FRESH INGREDIENTS FOR USE IN THE KITCHEN.
17,ep167,"OH, HI, LOVE."
18,ep167,"OH, HI, LOVE."
19,ep167,"HI, SWEETS..."
20,ep167,HOW'S DINNER?
21,ep167,"HI, SWEETS..."
22,ep167,HOW'S DINNER?
23,ep167,GREAT... READY.
24,ep167,GREAT... READY.
25,ep167,I GOT SOME ROSEMARY FOR YA.
26,ep167,I GOT SOME ROSEMARY FOR YA.
27,ep167,AND SOME LIMES...
28,ep167,THAT'S PERFECT.
29,ep167,THAT'LL BE GREAT ON THE FISH.
30,ep167,ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKE IS THE SIZE OF THE KITCHEN AND JUST THE ABILITY TO MOVE AROUND.
31,ep167,"THE WAY IT'S SET UP IS FANTASTIC, 'CAUSE THERE IS THE SPACE TO COOK AND WALK AROUND, AND YOU'RE NOT BUMPING INTO THINGS AND WONDERING WHERE THINGS ARE."
32,ep167,SO IT IS SET UP VERY NICELY.
33,ep167,(Suzanne) THE TWO OF THEM HAVE TRIED TO MAKE THE MOST OF WHAT HAS BEEN THEIR FIRST HOME TOGETHER.
34,ep167,"STILL, THE KOPPS HAVE GOTTEN TIRED OF LIVING IN A HOUSE THEY DON'T OWN."
35,ep167,(Ken) A RENTAL LIKE THIS DOESN'T EXACTLY COME WITH NICE FIXTURES.
36,ep167,IT COMES WITH ENTRY-LEVEL FIXTURES IN THE BATHROOM.
37,ep167,IT COMES WITH ENTRY- LEVEL FAUCETS AND ENTRY-LEVEL SINKS AND ENTRY-LEVEL CARPETING.
38,ep167,AND ENTRY-LEVEL CARPETING.
39,ep167,AND A USED STOVE.
40,ep167,AND A USED STOVE.
41,ep167,"YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A RENTAL."
42,ep167,"(Suzanne) AND BECAUSE KEN'S JOB KEEPS HIM ON THE ROAD FOR A GOOD PART OF EACH MONTH, GARDENING HAS GONE FROM BEING A PLEASURE TO A CHORE."
43,ep167,"(Ken) AS MY CAREER'S CONTINUED TO CHANGE NOW, I'M SPENDING LESS AND LESS TIME HERE, AND THE YARD'S GETTING KIND OF BURDENSOME."
44,ep167,"IT REQUIRES A LOT OF TIME EVERY WEEKEND TRIMMING THINGS, PLANTING THINGS, REPLACING THINGS."
45,ep167,"(Suzanne) KEN AND JAYE PREFER TO SPEND TIME ON HOBBIES, LIKE FISHING, SCUBA DIVING AND CAMPING, ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE NOT ONLY BIG CHUNKS OF TIME, BUT ALSO A GREAT DEAL OF STORAGE SPACE."
46,ep167,THE DETACHED GARAGE KEN AND JAYE WERE SO HAPPY WITH IS NOW FULL OF EQUIPMENT.
47,ep167,(Ken) GOT THE FISHING GEAR AND THE DIVING GEAR AND ALL OF THIS STUFF.
48,ep167,WE TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE FOR TWO PEOPLE.
49,ep167,WE TAKE UP A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE FOR JUST TWO OF US.
50,ep167,"(Suzanne) ACTUALLY, IT ISN'T JUST THE TWO OF THEM."
51,ep167,A FEMALE RABBIT NAMED STEW HAS BECOME A CHERISHED PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD.
52,ep167,"(Ken) WE BROUGHT HER IN, AND SHE WRAPPED MY WIFE AROUND HER LITTLE FINGER."
53,ep167,IN MOMENTS.
54,ep167,IN MOMENTS.
55,ep167,"AND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG, EITHER."
56,ep167,"AND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG, EITHER."
57,ep167,SHE'S BECOME A GOOD MEMBER OF THE FAMILY.
58,ep167,"(Suzanne) AS STEW GOT TO KNOW JAYE AND KEN, SHE ALSO GOT TO KNOW HER WAY AROUND THE HOUSE."
59,ep167,"STEW, WHEN WE FIRST GOT HER, SHE SPENT MOST OF HER TIME IN ONE ROOM."
60,ep167,"AND STEW THEN MOVED AND TOOK OVER SEVERAL ROOMS, AND NOW SHE BASICALLY RUNS THE WHOLE HOUSE AND HAS THE RUN OF THE PLACE."
61,ep167,"SHE'S HOUSE BROKEN AND QUIET AND CLEAN AND JUST A GREAT, GREAT PET."
62,ep167,"(Suzanne) THE SECOND BEDROOM IS OFFICIALLY STEW'S ROOM, BUT KEN AND JAYE USE IT AS AN OFFICE, AND IF THEY HAVE HOUSE GUESTS, THEY'RE IN THERE, TOO."
63,ep167,SO IT'S TIME FOR A BIGGER HOUSE.
64,ep167,BUT THE KOPPS HAVE NEVER BOUGHT REAL ESTATE BEFORE AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT IT.
65,ep167,HOW DO YOU SELECT A REALTOR?
66,ep167,DO YOU CALL THEM AND MAKE APPOINTMENTS?
67,ep167,DO YOU BUMP INTO THEM?
68,ep167,DO YOU ASK YOUR FRIENDS?
69,ep167,SO HOW DO YOU DO IT?
70,ep167,'CAUSE WE NEVER LOOKED FOR A HOUSE.
71,ep167,"NEITHER OF US HAS EVER PURCHASED ANYTHING, SO HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT FINDING THESE PEOPLE?"
72,ep167,WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE WEB.
73,ep167,"YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR FEATURES, BEDROOMS, BATHROOMS, SQUARE FOOTAGE, PRICING."
74,ep167,"SQUARE FOOTAGE, PRICING."
75,ep167,AND WE STARTED CALLING PEOPLE.
76,ep167,AND WE STARTED CALLING PEOPLE.
77,ep167,"YOU KNOW, HOW BIG IS YOUR HOUSE?"
78,ep167,HOUSES THAT WE COULD REMEMBER IN OUR HEAD.
79,ep167,FRIENDS AND OUR FAMILIES AND THINGS.
80,ep167,"YOU KNOW, HOW BIG IS YOUR HOUSE?"
81,ep167,"YOU KNOW, HOW BIG IS YOUR HOUSE?"
82,ep167,WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR HOUSE?
83,ep167,WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT YOUR HOUSE?
84,ep167,SO WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE IMPORTANT.
85,ep167,(Suzanne) JAYE AND KEN ALSO LOOKED AROUND THEIR CURRENT HOME FOR IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO CHANGE AND WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO KEEP.
86,ep167,"SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A NEW HOME WOULD INCLUDE A FIREPLACE, A THIRD BEDROOM FOR THE OFFICE."
87,ep167,SECOND BATHROOM.
88,ep167,SECOND BATHROOM.
89,ep167,TWO BATHROOMS WOULD BE GREAT.
90,ep167,TWO BATHROOMS WOULD BE GREAT.
91,ep167,"DETACHED GARAGE IS CRITICAL, DETACHED GARAGE AND A LONG DRIVEWAY."
92,ep167,THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
93,ep167,THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
94,ep167,"AND ALSO, PARTY FLOW, AND ALSO, PARTY FLOW, HAVE A NICE FLOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE ENTERTAINING, SO THEY KNOW WHERE..."
95,ep167,IT'S JUST DIRECTED.
96,ep167,"(Suzanne) ONE FEATURE OF THEIR CURRENT HOME THAT THE COUPLE WOULD LIKE THEIR NEW HOUSE TO HAVE IS STYLISH DESIGN ELEMENTS, LIKE HARDWOOD FLOORS."
97,ep167,"IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN OLD HOME, BUT IT HAS TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT."
98,ep167,"WE DON'T WANT A COOKIE CUTTER KIND OF PLACE, AND THE INTERIOR'S PRETTY IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW, SOME DESIGN ELEMENTS IN THE INTERIOR."
99,ep167,"(Suzanne) THANKS TO ALL THEIR RESEARCH, KEN AND JAYE HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF HOUSE BIG THEY'D LIKE THEIR HOUSE TO BE AND WHAT FEATURES ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM."
100,ep167,"WITH THESE PRIORITIES IN MIND, THE COUPLE IS STARTING THEIR HOUSE SEARCH ON THEIR OWN."
101,ep167,"PEOPLE WHO HAVE SHOPPED FOR HOMES BEFORE TELL US THAT WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE HOUSE, YOU'LL KNOW IT."
102,ep167,"YOU'LL KNOW THAT THIS IS THE PLACE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK ANY FURTHER."
103,ep167,"(Suzanne) COMING UP NEXT, THE KOPPS START THEIR SEARCH WITHOUT THE HELP OF A REALTOR."
104,ep167,BUT WILL THEY GET IN OVER THEIR HEADS?
105,ep167,"OH, JAYE, YOU'VE GOTTA COME IN THE BEDROOM."
106,ep167,LOOK AT THIS.
107,ep167,(Suzanne) THAT'S NEXT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
108,ep167,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
109,ep167,JAYE KOPP AND HER HUSBAND KEN HAVE DECIDED IT'S TIME TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR SMALL TWO-BEDROOM RENTAL HOUSE.
110,ep167,"THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A HOME THAT DOESN'T DEMAND TOO MUCH TIME FOR MAINTENANCE, BUT OFFERS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL THEIR NEEDS."
111,ep167,"SINCE NEITHER JAYE NOR KEN HAS EVER BOUGHT A HOUSE BEFORE, THEY FIRST GOT ADVICE FROM THEIR FRIENDS AND DID RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET."
112,ep167,NOW THEY'VE STARTED LOOKING AT HOMES ON THEIR OWN.
113,ep167,"WELL, THIS IS CUTE."
114,ep167,"WELL, THIS IS CUTE."
115,ep167,"YEAH, I LIKE THIS."
116,ep167,"YEAH, I LIKE THIS."
117,ep167,(Suzanne) OPEN HOUSES CAN BE A GREAT WAY TO SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
118,ep167,"BUT WITHOUT A REALTOR GUIDING THEM, JAYE AND KEN HAVEN'T HAD MUCH LUCK FINDING A PLACE THAT SUITS THEIR NEEDS."
119,ep167,"WELL, LET'S GO FIND ANOTHER OPEN HOUSE."
120,ep167,(Suzanne) THE NEXT OPEN HOUSE KEN AND JAYE FIND IS FOR A HOME THAT'S CLEARLY LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE.
121,ep167,BUT THEY'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK TO SEE IF A HOUSE LIKE THIS FEELS RIGHT TO THEM.
122,ep167,"THIS IS INCREDIBLE, LOVE."
123,ep167,"THIS IS INCREDIBLE, LOVE."
124,ep167,YOU LOVE THIS DRIVEWAY?
125,ep167,YOU LOVE THIS DRIVEWAY?
126,ep167,I SURE DO...
127,ep167,"OH, LOOK AT THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS."
128,ep167,"OH, MY GOSH."
129,ep167,"OH, MY GOSH."
130,ep167,IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD.
131,ep167,IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD.
132,ep167,LET'S GO IN.

162,ep167,BEAUTIFUL RAILS AND THINGS.
163,ep167,"OH, IT IS."
164,ep167,"OH, IT IS."
165,ep167,WHAT A GORGEOUS PLACE.
166,ep167,"LOOK AT THESE CEILINGS, TOO, ALL THE MOLDING IT HAS."
167,ep167,ALL THE MOLDING IT HAS.
168,ep167,WOW! A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
169,ep167,"JAYE, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS BEDROOM."
170,ep167,"JAYE, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS BEDROOM."
171,ep167,OKAY. MY GOD.
172,ep167,"OH, MY GOD."
173,ep167,LOOK AT THIS FIREPLACE.
174,ep167,LOOK AT THIS FIREPLACE.
175,ep167,THIS IS HUGE...
176,ep167,ALL THE GLASS.
177,ep167,THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
178,ep167,"WOW! JAYE AND KEN SEE A LOT THAT THEY LIKE ABOUT THE HOUSE, BUT THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S RIGHT FOR THEM."
179,ep167,TOO MUCH HOUSE FOR US!
180,ep167,TOO MUCH HOUSE FOR US!
181,ep167,THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH HOUSE FOR US.
182,ep167,THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH HOUSE FOR US.
183,ep167,"IT'S BEAUTIFUL, THOUGH, JUST TOO MUCH TO CLEAN."
184,ep167,"(Suzanne) SO FAR, ONE HOUSE WAS TOO BIG AND ONE HOUSE TOO SMALL."
185,ep167,WILL THE NEXT ONE BE JUST RIGHT?
186,ep167,IS ANYBODY HERE?
187,ep167,IS ANYBODY HERE?
188,ep167,HELLO. ON IN.
189,ep167,HI. ARE YOU?
190,ep167,HOW ARE YOU?

199,ep167,NICE TO MEET YOU.
200,ep167,"CHRIS, I'M KEN."
201,ep167,NICE TO MEET YOU.

206,ep167,"HI, KEN..."
207,ep167,HOW ARE YOU?
208,ep167,GOOD... GREAT.
209,ep167,GOOD... GREAT.
210,ep167,LET ME GIVE YOU A FLIER ON THE HOUSE.
211,ep167,LET ME GIVE YOU A FLIER ON THE HOUSE.
212,ep167,ALL RIGHT.
213,ep167,ALL RIGHT.
214,ep167,"THE HOUSE IS A TWO BEDROOM, ONE BATH, AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND, SEE WHAT YOU THINK, AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE END, I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM."
215,ep167,HOW'S THAT?
216,ep167,HOW'S THAT?
217,ep167,PERFECT. YOU.
218,ep167,THANK YOU.
219,ep167,GOOD. YOU SOON.
220,ep167,"OH, THIS MUST BE THE MASTER."
221,ep167,I LIKE THOSE WINDOWS.
222,ep167,"IT'S AWFULLY SMALL, THOUGH."
223,ep167,THAT RECESSED LIGHTING'S NICE.
224,ep167,"(Suzanne) AFTER A QUICK LOOK AROUND, KEN AND JAYE SEE THIS HOUSE ISN'T RIGHT FOR THEM."
225,ep167,"IT HAS TWO SMALL BEDROOMS INSTEAD OF THE THREE THEY WANT, AND IT HAS A SWIMMING POOL IN THE BACKYARD THAT THEY DEFINITELY DON'T WANT."
226,ep167,"BUT THE HOUSE DOES HAVE ONE MAJOR PLUS, AND THAT'S ITS REALTOR."
227,ep167,"WHEN KEN AND JAYE TALK TO CHRIS BROTMAN ABOUT THEIR SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME, THEY BEGIN TO THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP THEM."
228,ep167,"I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--WHY DON'T WE GO INSIDE, AND LET'S MAKE A LIST OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."
229,ep167,OKAY. RIGHT?
230,ep167,ALL RIGHT?
231,ep167,"SURE. ONCE CHRIS KNOWS WHAT KEN AND JAYE'S PRIORITIES ARE, HE CAN CHECK THE MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE BACK AT HIS OFFICE FOR HOUSES THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS."
232,ep167,"THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A DETACHED GARAGE, A LONG DRIVEWAY, THREE BEDROOMS, TWO BATHS, NICE KITCHEN, AND HARDWOOD FLOORS IS WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR."
233,ep167,"(Suzanne) AFTER FINDING SOME POSSIBILITIES, CHRIS ARRANGES TO GO SEE HOUSES WITH JAYE AND KEN LATER IN THE WEEK."
234,ep167,(Chris) THIS HOUSE IS A LITTLE MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
235,ep167,"IT'S GOT THREE BEDROOMS IN IT, AND IT'S IN A GREAT LITTLE NEIGHBORHOOD."
236,ep167,IT'S A CUTE HOUSE...
237,ep167,I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.
238,ep167,THE LIVING ROOM IS REALLY NICE.
239,ep167,IT'S REALLY A GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM WITH FORCED AIR HEATING.
240,ep167,WITH FORCED AIR HEATING.
241,ep167,TERRIFIC. NICE...

248,ep167,"UH-HUH, THAT'S PERFECT."
249,ep167,"UH-HUH, THAT'S PERFECT."
250,ep167,AND THEN OVER HERE YOU HAVE ALL THE APPLIANCES.
251,ep167,"AND THERE'S LOTS OF COUNTER SPACE HERE, TOO."
252,ep167,"AND THERE'S LOTS OF COUNTER SPACE HERE, TOO."
253,ep167,AND A BACKSPLASH AND A BACKSPLASH AND YOU GOT A BUILT-IN HERE.
254,ep167,AND YOU GOT A BUILT-IN HERE.
255,ep167,I LIKE THE TRIM ON THE CABINETS.

257,ep167,LET'S GO SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
258,ep167,LET'S GO SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
259,ep167,YEAH. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEDROOMS.
260,ep167,"IT'S REALLY A NICE SIZE BEDROOM, TOO."
261,ep167,"(Jaye) OH, THIS'D BE GREAT FOR AN OFFICE."
262,ep167,THIS COULD BE A GREAT OFFICE.

294,ep167,YEAH. THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
295,ep167,I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
296,ep167,I LIKE ALL THE GLASS.

305,ep167,"OH, THIS IS A GOOD SIZE."
306,ep167,IT IS A GOOD SIZE YARD.
307,ep167,AND YOU'VE GOT THE DETACHED GARAGE BACK THERE.
308,ep167,THE YARD'S PRETTY LOW MAINTENANCE.
309,ep167,IT IS...
310,ep167,YOU'RE RIGHT.
311,ep167,"WELL, WE'RE GETTING CLOSER."
312,ep167,"WELL, WE'RE GETTING CLOSER."
313,ep167,"I THINK SO, TOO..."
314,ep167,"YEAH. THINK SO, TOO..."
315,ep167,YEAH. GOT THE TWO BEDROOMS AND THE THIRD FOR THE OFFICE.
316,ep167,AND THE THIRD FOR THE OFFICE.
317,ep167,UH-HUH. THE GARAGE IS THERE...
318,ep167,I DON'T KNOW.
319,ep167,IT'S JUST...
320,ep167,"I DON'T THINK THIS IS IT, YOU KNOW?"
321,ep167,"YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK, THOUGH..."
322,ep167,WE'RE GETTING CLOSER.
323,ep167,"IT'S A NICE LITTLE HOUSE, BUT IT JUST ISN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU."

330,ep167,"IT'S NICE, BUT IT JUST..."
331,ep167,IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT EDGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
332,ep167,"(Suzanne) TOURING A HOUSE WITH THE KOPPS GIVES CHRIS A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHAT IT IS THEY'RE AFTER-- MORE SPACE, LESS MAINTENANCE AND SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE UNIQUE."
333,ep167,"COMING UP NEXT, CHRIS HAS A SURPRISE IN STORE FOR JAYE AND KEN."

339,ep167,THEY'D LIKE SOMEPLACE BIGGER THAN THE TWO-BEDROOM HOUSE THEY'RE CURRENTLY RENTING.
340,ep167,"THE PAIR STARTED THEIR HOUSE HUNT ON THEIR OWN, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW A REAL ESTATE AGENT THEY WANTED TO WORK WITH."
341,ep167,THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH LUCK FINDING ANYTHING SUITABLE.
342,ep167,"THEN AT AN OPEN HOUSE, THEY MET REALTOR CHRIS BROTMAN AND HIT IT OFF."
343,ep167,"BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY GAVE HIM, CHRIS CAME UP WITH SOME POTENTIAL HOUSES."

541,ep167,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
542,ep167,KEN AND JAYE KOPP DECIDED THAT THEIR RENTAL HOUSE WAS TOO SMALL AND THEIR YARD WAS TOO BIG.
543,ep167,SO THEY FIGURED IT WAS TIME TO MAKE THE LEAP INTO HOMEOWNERSHIP.
544,ep167,THEY FOUND A HOUSE THAT IS EVERYTHING THEY WERE HOPING FOR AND MORE AND HAVE MADE AN OFFER.

570,ep167,THIS IS GREAT...
571,ep167,LET'S GO SEE IT.
572,ep167,THIS IS GREAT...
573,ep167,LET'S GO SEE IT.
574,ep167,WE HAVE A HOUSE!

583,ep167,LET'S CALL CHRIS.
584,ep167,LET'S CALL CHRIS.
585,ep167,(Suzanne) THE KOPPS HAVE WASTED NO TIME MOVING INTO THE THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE THAT CAUGHT THEIR EYE WHEN THEY FIRST SAW IT.
586,ep167,BOTH KEN AND JAYE ARE GETTING COMFORTABLE IN THEIR NEW HOME.
587,ep167,THEY FIND THEY HAVE TAKEN TO HOMEOWNERSHIP RIGHT AWAY.
588,ep167,"WELL, WE'VE BEEN IN THIS PLACE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS NOW, AND IT'S BEEN FABULOUS."
589,ep167,JUST LOVE IT.
590,ep167,JUST LOVE IT.
591,ep167,IT'S BEEN GREAT.
592,ep167,IT'S BEEN GREAT.
593,ep167,IT'S VERY NICE OWNING YOUR OWN HOME.
594,ep167,"IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO FIND A HOUSE WITH CHARACTER, AND WE FOUND THAT HERE."
595,ep167,"THE FIREPLACES ARE VERY DIFFERENT, AND THEY STICK OUT, AND THE BEAUTIFUL MANTELS AND THE WINDOWS AND JUST THE WHOLE WAY THE HOUSE FLOWS."
596,ep167,IT HAS A PERSONALITY OF ITS OWN.
597,ep167,IT'S WONDERFUL.
598,ep167,(Suzanne) ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE WAS A SURPRISE TO BOTH KEN AND JAYE.
599,ep167,(Jaye) WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS BEHIND THE DOOR.
600,ep167,WE CAME STROLLING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THOUGHT IT WAS GORGEOUS AS IT WAS.
601,ep167,AND THOUGHT IT WAS GORGEOUS AS IT WAS.
602,ep167,WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR?
603,ep167,WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR?
604,ep167,I THOUGHT IT WAS A CLOSET OR SOMETHING THE WAY THAT IT'S ALL FROSTED GLASS.
605,ep167,THE WAY THAT IT'S ALL FROSTED GLASS.
606,ep167,"... A PANTRY, BACK PORCH."
607,ep167,"... A PANTRY, BACK PORCH."
608,ep167,"DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS, AND WE OPENED IT UP TO THIS STUNNING ROOM WITH THE HIGH CEILINGS AND ANOTHER FIREPLACE AND A BEAUTIFUL BATH."
609,ep167,AND A BEAUTIFUL BATH.
610,ep167,DOUBLE SINK AND JACUZZI BATH DOUBLE SINK AND JACUZZI BATH AND A WALK-IN...
611,ep167,AND A WALK-IN...
612,ep167,WALK-IN CLOSET.
613,ep167,WALK-IN CLOSET.
614,ep167,"WE WERE STUNNED, 'CAUSE WE LOVED THE HOUSE EVEN BEFORE WE GOT BACK THERE."
615,ep167,(Suzanne) THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE NOW FOR EVERYONE TO SPREAD OUT.
616,ep167,THEY EVEN HAVE THE GUEST ROOM THEY WANTED.
617,ep167,AND KEN AND JAYE LOVE BEING ABLE TO PUT THEIR OWN STAMP ON THE HOUSE.
618,ep167,THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE DID TO REALLY MAKE THIS SPACE OUR OWN.
619,ep167,"ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WE DID WAS, FROM MY STANDPOINT, WAS DEVELOPING THE OFFICE."
620,ep167,"I WORK AT HOME A LOT, AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE IN THE OFFICE, SO WE'RE REALLY CUSTOMIZING THE OFFICE AND HAVING CUSTOM WORK SPACES AND CABINETS AND THINGS MADE..."
621,ep167,REALLY MADE THIS OUR OWN.
622,ep167,"(Suzanne) AND SAFELY NESTLED INTO A CORNER IS EVERYTHING THEIR PET RABBIT, STEW, MIGHT NEED TO FEEL AT HOME IN THE NEW HOUSE."
623,ep167,BUT STEW'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S ENJOYING HAVING HER FAVORITE THINGS AROUND HER.
624,ep167,JAYE IS REDISCOVERING A FEW OF HER OWN.
625,ep167,JAYE HAS NOT UNPACKED A LOT OF HER BOOKS FOR YEARS AND YEARS.
626,ep167,"WHEN WE WERE FIRST MARRIED AND LIVED IN THE OTHER HOME, THAT STUFF WAS STILL PACKED AWAY."
627,ep167,"YOU KNOW, HERE..."
628,ep167,"I REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE SITTING ON THE FLOOR HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND UNPACKING ALL THE BOOKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND PUTTING THEM UP, JAYE WAS JUST, WOW, MY FRIENDS."
629,ep167,LOOK AT MY FRIENDS.
630,ep167,"YOU KNOW, HERE'S JANE AUSTEN..."
631,ep167,HERE'S MARK TWAIN.
632,ep167,"YOU KNOW, HERE'S THOMAS HARDY..."
633,ep167,MY FRIENDS.
634,ep167,THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT REALLY HELP US MAKE THIS OUR OWN SPACE.
635,ep167,"JAYE, KEN AND EVEN STEW CAN NOW ENJOY THEIR NEW HOME WITH PLENTY OF ROOM TO HAVE ALL OF THEIR FAVORITE THINGS AROUND THEM."

2,ep168,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep168,GREG AND KAREN COWELL AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN HAVE LIVED IN THEIR CURRENT HOME FOR EIGHT YEARS.
4,ep168,"THEY LOVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT THEIR HOME IS NO LONGER BIG ENOUGH."
5,ep168,"WITH TWO GROWING KIDS, THIS FAMILY OF SPORTS ENTHUSIASTS NEEDS TO FIND A HOME THAT HAS ENOUGH SPACE FOR THEM AND ALL THEIR GEAR."
6,ep168,CAN THE COWELLS HIT A HOME RUN?
7,ep168,(Karen) WAY TO GO!
8,ep168,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
9,ep168,♪♪ KAREN AND GREG COWELL KNOW THEY HAVE TO FIND A BIGGER HOME FOR THEIR FAMILY.
10,ep168,"THEIR TWO GROWING CHILDREN, KATIE AND RYAN, NEED MORE SPACE."
11,ep168,(Katie) AW!
12,ep168,(Katie) AW!
13,ep168,SNAGGED IT AGAIN...
14,ep168,SNAGGED IT AGAIN...
15,ep168,"THEY LIKE THEIR CURRENT HOUSE, BUT WITH ONLY THREE BEDROOMS, IT'S JUST NOT BIG ENOUGH."
16,ep168,SO THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME TO MAKE A MOVE.
17,ep168,CURRENTLY WE LIVE IN A HOUSE...
18,ep168,WE'VE BEEN THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW.
19,ep168,AND WE MOVED IN THINKING THAT THIS WAS THE LAST HOUSE.
20,ep168,"AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE OUTGROWN IT."
21,ep168,WITH TWO CHILDREN...
22,ep168,NOT ENOUGH CLOSET SPACE...
23,ep168,NOT ENOUGH GARAGE SPACE...
24,ep168,NOT ENOUGH KITCHEN SPACE...
25,ep168,THE KIDS ARE MAKING A TRANSITION RIGHT NOW.
26,ep168,"KATIE'LL BE STARTING KINDERGARTEN, AND THEN RYAN'S GOING TO MIDDLE SCHOOL."
27,ep168,"AND SO HE'S STEPPING UP, AND THEY'RE BOTH GONNA BE CHANGING SCHOOLS."
28,ep168,"WE FIGURE IT'S A GOOD TIME TO MAKE A COMPLETE MOVE, HOUSING WISE AND FOR THE SCHOOLS."
29,ep168,(Suzanne) BUT KAREN AND GREG ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO THEIR CHILDREN'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE MOVE.
30,ep168,(Greg) RYAN WAS A LITTLE DISTURBED.
31,ep168,"HE'S GROWN UP WITH THE KIDS IN THE AREA, SO HE WAS REAL CONCERNED ABOUT HIS TIGHT-KNIT GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT HE WAS GONNA LEAVE, AND HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY NEW FRIENDS."
32,ep168,(Suzanne) THE COWELLS LIKE THEIR COMMUNITY AND WANT TO STAY NEARBY.
33,ep168,"WELL, WE LIVE A PRETTY FULL DAY AT WORK, AND WE FEEL THAT WHEN WE GET HOME WE SHOULD ENJOY IT."
34,ep168,AND WE PLACED OURSELVES IN AN AREA WHERE WE CAN DO THAT.
35,ep168,"THERE'S MOUNTAINS, IT'S CLOSE TO THE BEACH, IT'S CLOSE TO THE LAKE, AND WE ENJOY ALL THAT."
36,ep168,(Suzanne) THE FAMILY ALSO ENJOYS THEIR BIG BACKYARD AND MAXIMIZES THEIR USE OF OUTDOOR SPACE.
37,ep168,"INDOORS, THOUGH, IT'S ANOTHER STORY."
38,ep168,THE COMMON AREAS OF THEIR CURRENT HOME ARE BECOMING CRAMPED.
39,ep168,(Karen) ONE OF THE BIG THINGS FOR ME WAS THE KITCHEN.
40,ep168,WE DO A LOT OF ENTERTAINING.
41,ep168,WE DO ALL THE ENTERTAINING FOR FAMILY.
42,ep168,"WE HAVE FRIENDS WE HAVE OVER, AND THE KITCHEN IS VERY SMALL."
43,ep168,"AND WHEN THE KIDS WERE LITTLE, IT WAS NO BIG DEAL."
44,ep168,"NOW THAT THEY'RE BIGGER, AND THEY WANT TO BE IN THE KITCHEN AND HELPING, MORE THAN ONE PERSON IN THE KITCHEN IS TOO MANY."
45,ep168,(Suzanne) THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR A HOME THAT HAS A BETTER FLOW FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE FAMILY ROOM.
46,ep168,(Greg) WE WANT IT TO BE MORE OF AN OPEN AREA THAN IT IS CURRENTLY.
47,ep168,"YOU KNOW, BECOME MORE OF THE FOCUS AS YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM, INSTEAD OF JUST BEING A CUBICLE OFF TO THE SIDE, AS WE HAVE NOW."
48,ep168,THE ROOMS ARE REAL BOXY AND SQUARED-OFF.
49,ep168,"(Suzanne) FOR HIS PART, GREG LIKES THE MASTER BEDROOM, BUT ISN'T WILD ABOUT THE MASTER BATH."
50,ep168,"(Greg) FOR ME UH, THE BATHROOM..."
51,ep168,I THINK THE TWO MOST-USED PLACES IN THE HOUSE ARE THE BATHROOM AND THE KITCHEN.
52,ep168,"AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE A BIGGER BATHROOM, SO WE CAN MOVE AROUND AND HAVE MORE FREE SPACE."
53,ep168,(Suzanne) MORE FREE SPACE IS THE COWELLS' BATTLE CRY AS THEY BEGIN LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME.
54,ep168,"THIS ACTIVE OUTDOORSY FAMILY ALSO HAS LOTS OF EQUIPMENT THAT IS STUFFED INTO THEIR CURRENT GARAGE, SO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE SPACE THERE, TOO."
55,ep168,"KAREN AND GREG ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO FIND A RECENTLY BUILT HOUSE, ONE THAT'S IN MOVE-IN CONDITION AND THAT THEY CAN DECORATE TO SUIT THEIR TASTES."
56,ep168,IT'S GONNA BE QUITE A CHALLENGE TO WALK INTO A HOUSE AND JUST KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE THE POTENTIAL OF IT.
57,ep168,BECAUSE I'M USED TO WALKING INTO A HOUSE THAT'S UP-TO-DATE.
58,ep168,AND I DON'T KNOW THA WE CAN REALLY GO THROUGH A REMODEL.
59,ep168,I THINK IT'S ALL...
60,ep168,WE'RE PRETTY PARTICULAR.
61,ep168,I'M SURE A REALTOR WILL BE READY TO GET RID OF US BEFORE THIS IS ALL OVER.
62,ep168,"(laughing) (Suzanne) WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS, KAREN AND GREG HIT THE HOUSING MARKET."
63,ep168,THIS IS PRETTY SMALL.
64,ep168,THIS IS PRETTY SMALL.
65,ep168,IT'S SMALL.
66,ep168,IT'S SMALL.
67,ep168,(Suzanne) FIND OUT WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THE COWELLS...
68,ep168,NEXT. WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
69,ep168,KAREN AND GREG COWELL HAVE OUTGROWN THEIR CURRENT HOME.
70,ep168,"WITH TWO KIDS AND AN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE, THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE SPACE THEY NEED."
71,ep168,"THE COWELLS WANT A HOME THAT'S NEW OR NEWLY REMODELED, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE HASSLE OF A RENOVATION."
72,ep168,THEY DO WANT TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT NEIGHBORHOOD.
73,ep168,"FOR THIS DIFFICULT SEARCH GREG AND KAREN HAVE JOINED FORCES WITH REALTOR DEBBIE KELLY, A CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND WHO IS ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA..."
74,ep168,"THE COWELLS HAVE VERY, VERY SPECIFIC..."
75,ep168,"THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC ITEMS, SUCH AS HOMES THAT ARE NEWER, HOMES THAT ARE VERY CLEAN, IN MINT CONDITION AND WITH THEIR TASTES."
76,ep168,AND THAT CAN BE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT.
77,ep168,BECAUSE USED HOMES...
78,ep168,SOMEBODY LIVES THERE.
79,ep168,AND THEY'VE ALREADY DECORATED IT AND DESIGNED IT ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS.
80,ep168,"(Suzanne) DEBBIE HITS THE MARKET WITH THE COWELLS, SHOWING THEM THE KINDS OF HOMES THAT WILL FIT THEIR BUDGET AND HOPEFULLY THEIR NEEDS."
81,ep168,"OKAY, THIS MUST BE THE FAMILY ROOM."
82,ep168,AND THE KITCHEN IN THERE...
83,ep168,"UM, I DON'T KNOW..."
84,ep168,I THINK IT'S PRETTY SMALL.
85,ep168,"UM, I DON'T KNOW..."
86,ep168,I THINK IT'S PRETTY SMALL.
87,ep168,YEAH. YOU THINK?
88,ep168,DON'T YOU THINK?
89,ep168,I THINK WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BIGGER FAMILY ROOM I THINK WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BIGGER FAMILY ROOM AND A BIGGER KITCHEN.
90,ep168,AND A BIGGER KITCHEN.
91,ep168,IT'S MUCH SMALLER IT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN WHAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY.
92,ep168,SO WE'RE NOT ACCOMPLISHING WHAT WE WANT.
93,ep168,I CAN TELL THE ROOMS ARE PRETTY SMALL.
94,ep168,I DON'T THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK.
95,ep168,I DON'T THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK.
96,ep168,OKAY. NOT REALLY AS BIG AS WE WERE LOOKING FOR.
97,ep168,IT'S NOT REALLY AS BIG AS WE WERE LOOKING FOR.
98,ep168,OKAY. HAVE ANOTHER HOUSE THAT I HAVE MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT TODAY.

103,ep168,IT'S A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY.
104,ep168,IT'S NOT TOO FAR...
105,ep168,IT'S A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY.
106,ep168,"OKAY, GREAT."
107,ep168,"OKAY, GREAT."
108,ep168,AND WE'LL SEE...
109,ep168,SORRY ABOUT THAT...
110,ep168,SORRY ABOUT THAT...
111,ep168,THAT'S OKAY.
112,ep168,THAT'S OKAY.
113,ep168,I THINK THE THE ROOMS ARE WAY TOO SMALL.
114,ep168,"NO, LISTEN, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM..."
115,ep168,WE HAVE TO GO AND SEE WHAT'S GONNA WORK FOR YOU.
116,ep168,ALL RIGHT.
117,ep168,ALL RIGHT.
118,ep168,"ALL RIGHT, GREAT."
119,ep168,"ALL RIGHT, GREAT."
120,ep168,"OKAY, THIS, YOU GUYS..."
121,ep168,HAS A THREE CAR GARAGE...
122,ep168,"YEAH, I LIKE THE THREE CAR GARAGE."
123,ep168,"YEAH, I LIKE THE THREE CAR GARAGE."
124,ep168,"RIGHT, FOR THE BOAT, I WAS THINKING."
125,ep168,"RIGHT, FOR THE BOAT, I WAS THINKING."
126,ep168,"IT'S GOT SOME GOOD CURB APPEAL, TOO."
127,ep168,THE VEGETATION...
128,ep168,IT'S A NICE LOOKING HOUSE ON THE OUTSIDE.
129,ep168,"AND IT'S GOT THE SQUARE FOOTAGE YOU WERE LOOKING FOR, AND THE BEDROOMS."
130,ep168,AND THE BEDROOMS.
131,ep168,YEAH... MANY BEDROOMS?
132,ep168,YEAH... MANY BEDROOMS?

137,ep168,"OKAY, YOU GUYS."
138,ep168,"OKAY, YOU GUYS."
139,ep168,OKAY. IT'S BLUE.
140,ep168,"OH, IT'S BLUE."
141,ep168,"WOW... HEH, HEH."
142,ep168,"WOW... HEH, HEH."
143,ep168,ALL BLUE.
144,ep168,ALL BLUE.
145,ep168,A LOT OF BLUE.
146,ep168,A LOT OF BLUE.
147,ep168,"WELL, LET'S LOOK UPSTAIRS."
148,ep168,"ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO CHECK OUT THE MASTER BEDROOM."
149,ep168,"ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO CHECK OUT THE MASTER BEDROOM."
150,ep168,OKAY. SEE HOW THAT WORKS.
151,ep168,(Suzanne) THE BLUE CARPET IS THE COWELLS' FIRST INDICATION THAT RENOVATIONS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MOLD THIS HOUSE TO THEIR TASTES.
152,ep168,(Greg) IT'S STILL BLUE.
153,ep168,(Suzanne) AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THEY DISCOVER A GOOD-SIZED FAMILY ROOM CONNECTED TO ALL THE BEDROOMS.
154,ep168,I THINK THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.
155,ep168,KINDA SMALL.
156,ep168,KINDA SMALL.
157,ep168,"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
158,ep168,"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
159,ep168,THEY SURE COULD'A TAKEN SOME OF THIS MASTER BEDROOM...
160,ep168,AND SWITCHED IT OUT HERE TO...
161,ep168,AND SWITCHED IT OUT HERE TO...
162,ep168,YEAH. LITTLE BIT BIGGER...
163,ep168,A LITTLE BIT BIGGER...
164,ep168,AND THE BLUE CARPET AGAIN...
165,ep168,AND THE BLUE CARPET AGAIN...
166,ep168,AND THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BATH.
167,ep168,AND THIS MUST BE THE MASTER BATH.
168,ep168,"MM-HMM. UM, IT'S OKAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'D HAVE TO RIP OUT THIS LINOLEUM."
169,ep168,"BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'D HAVE TO RIP OUT THIS LINOLEUM."
170,ep168,"MM-HMM. KNOW, MAYBE A RESALE HOUSE ISN'T GONNA WORK, AND WE'LL HAVE TO GO LOOK AT SOME NEW HOMES."
171,ep168,MAYBE SO.
172,ep168,MAYBE SO.
173,ep168,IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
174,ep168,IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

183,ep168,"WELL, WE HAVE TO KEEP TRYING."
184,ep168,ALL RIGHT.
185,ep168,(Suzanne) AS KAREN AND GREG WRAP UP THEIR SEARCH FOR THE DAY THEY BEGIN CONSIDERING DEBBIE'S SUGGESTION THAT THEY LOOK AT SOME BRAND-NEW HOUSES THAT ARE BEING BUILT IN THE AREA.
186,ep168,THE BENEFIT TO BUYING A BRAND-NEW HOUSE IS THE OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE IT TO FIT YOUR PERSONAL STYLE.
187,ep168,THE DRAWBACK IS POSSIBLY HAVING TO WAIT MONTHS FOR CONSTRUCTION TO BE COMPLETED.
188,ep168,"THE FOLLOWING WEEK, AFTER TOURING SEVERAL MORE HOUSES WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING PROMISING, THE COWELLS DECIDE TO HEAD OUT ON THEIR OWN FOR A QUICK TOUR OF A NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA."
189,ep168,"THE MODEL HOMES IN THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE FULLY FURNISHED, TO GIVE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS AN IDEA OF WHAT A COMPLETED HOME COULD LOOK LIKE."
190,ep168,"OH, LOOK AT THIS."
191,ep168,"OH, LOOK AT THIS."

292,ep168,DID YA?
293,ep168,DID YA?
294,ep168,"(Suzanne) EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THIS MODEL HOME HAS, THE COWELLS DECIDE TO DO A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A BRAND-NEW HOUSE."
295,ep168,THE FAMILY HAS FINALLY FOUND A HOME THEY THINK WILL WORK FOR THEM.
296,ep168,"BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO COMMIT, WILL THE COWELLS GET COLD FEET?"
297,ep168,STAY TUNED.
298,ep168,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
299,ep168,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
300,ep168,KAREN AND GREG COWELL BEGAN LOOKING AT HOMES SEVERAL WEEKS AGO WITHOUT MUCH LUCK.
301,ep168,"SO ON THE ADVICE OF THEIR REALTOR DEBBIE KELLY, THE COWELLS STARTED INVESTIGATING A NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT NEAR THEIR CURRENT HOME."
302,ep168,"ALTHOUGH THE FAMILY WOULD LIKE A HOUSE THEY COULD MOVE RIGHT INTO, KAREN AND GREG HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ONE OF THE MODEL HOMES IN THE DEVELOPMENT."
303,ep168,"AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE COWELLS FOUND A HOUSE IN THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS JUST LIKE THE MODEL THEY LOVED, AND IT WAS BEING BUILT ON A GOOD-SIZED LOT."
304,ep168,SO THEY'VE BEGUN THE PAPERWORK REQUIRED TO PURCHASE IT ONCE CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE.
305,ep168,"IN THE MEANTIME, THE FAMILY HAS SOLD THEIR PREVIOUS HOME AND MOVED INTO A RENTAL HOUSE, INTENDING TO MOVE AGAIN INTO THEIR NEWLY-BUILT HOME, WHEN IT IS COMPLETED IN FOUR MONTHS."
306,ep168,BUT THIS FAMILY IS ABOUT TO BE THROWN FOR A LOOP.
307,ep168,ONE OF THE REASONS THE COWELLS LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THEIR NEW HOUSE IS BEING BUILT IS ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A BEAUTIFUL LAKE.
308,ep168,"BUT WHILE THE FAMILY IS OUT ENJOYING A A SATURDAY ON THE WATER, THEY SPOT ANOTHER NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, ONE THAT OFFERS HOMES IN THEIR PRICE RANGE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE LAKE."
309,ep168,SEVERAL DAYS LATER REALTOR DEBBIE KELLY TAKES KAREN AND GREG TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT THEY'VE SEEN FROM THE WATER.
310,ep168,HERE WE GO.
311,ep168,HERE WE GO.
312,ep168,OKAY. THE COWELLS WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'VE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
313,ep168,"SO EVEN THOUGH GREG AND KAREN HAVE ALREADY DECIDED ON THE OTHER HOUSE IN THE OTHER DEVELOPMENT, THEY WON'T BE SATISFIED UNTIL THEY'VE SEEN EVERYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE."
314,ep168,(Debbie) SO HOW DO YOU LIKE THE EXTERIOR?
315,ep168,I LIKE IT...
316,ep168,I LIKE THE STONE A LOT.
317,ep168,I LIKE IT...
318,ep168,I LIKE THE STONE A LOT.
319,ep168,"YES, VERY NICE."
320,ep168,"YES, VERY NICE."
321,ep168,"I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE SET ON THE OTHER HOUSE, BUT THIS COULD WORK."
322,ep168,OH... SORRY.
323,ep168,"OH, LOOK AT THIS..."
324,ep168,THIS IS A TOTALLY SEPARATE DINING ROOM.
325,ep168,THAT'S KIND OF A NEAT IDEA.
326,ep168,"OH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S EVEN YOUR COLOR."
327,ep168,I KNOW...
328,ep168,I LOVE THAT COLOR.
329,ep168,I KNOW...

354,ep168,THAT'S FOR SURE.
355,ep168,THAT'S FOR SURE.
356,ep168,"MM-HMM. THE FAMILY ROOM, I THINK, IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE OTHER HOUSE, AND I LIKE THE WAY IT'S SITUATED."
357,ep168,AND I LIKE THE WAY IT'S SITUATED.
358,ep168,"IT'S ELONGATED, WHICH MAKES IT NICE."
359,ep168,"IT'S ELONGATED, WHICH MAKES IT NICE."
360,ep168,"THERE'S MORE DEPTH, MORE SEPARATION FROM THE TWO ROOMS."

367,ep168,YEAH IT REALLY...
368,ep168,IT'S VERY DRAMATIC.
369,ep168,IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER HOME.
370,ep168,"YEAH, IT IS."
371,ep168,OKAY. HOPE THIS MASTER BEDROOM IS BIG.
372,ep168,"OH, THIS IS NOT BAD..."
373,ep168,"IT'S NOT AS BIG AS THE OTHER HOUSE, BUT IT'S REALLY A GOOD SIZE."
374,ep168,"AND IT'S GOT YOUR COLOR AGAIN, KAREN."
375,ep168,YOU KNOW WHAT...
376,ep168,ACCORDING TO THIS I THINK YOU CAN HAVE A DECK OFF OF THE MASTER BEDROOM.

378,ep168,I REALLY WOULD ENJOY THAT.
379,ep168,I REALLY WOULD ENJOY THAT.

427,ep168,THERE YOU GO.
428,ep168,THAT WILL BE GREAT.
429,ep168,THAT WILL BE GREAT.
430,ep168,"OH, MY GOSH."
431,ep168,"OH, MY GOSH."
432,ep168,THE BATHROOM'S GREAT...
433,ep168,THERE'S TWO SINKS.
434,ep168,I LIKE THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TUB AND THE SINKS.
435,ep168,WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
436,ep168,THERE'S A LOT OF COMPARISONS TO THINK ABOUT.
437,ep168,"OH, MY GOSH..."
438,ep168,"HERE WE GO AGAIN-- THIS HOUSE, THAT HOUSE THIS HOUSE, THAT HOUSE."
439,ep168,(Suzanne) LUCKILY IT'S NOT TOO LATE YET FOR THE COWELLS TO CHANGE THEIR MIND.
440,ep168,THE PAPERWORK ON THE FIRST HOUSE HASN'T BEEN COMPLETED.
441,ep168,BUT NOW IS THE MOMENT OF TRUTH...
442,ep168,WHICH HOUSE IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR THEM?
443,ep168,FIRST WE SEE WHAT LOTS ARE AVAILABLE WITH THE BUILDER.
444,ep168,THEN WE CAN...
445,ep168,THEN WE CAN...
446,ep168,'CAUSE THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE HOUSE.
447,ep168,'CAUSE THAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE HOUSE.
448,ep168,"I'D LOVE TO BE BACK ON A CUL-DE-SAC AGAIN, ON A FLAT STREET, WHERE THE KIDS CAN PLAY BASKETBALL AND RIDE THEIR BIKES OUT IN THE FRONT STREET."
449,ep168,I DON'T KNOW...
450,ep168,I DON'T KNOW...
451,ep168,AND THE VIEW IS IMPORTANT.
452,ep168,AND THE VIEW IS IMPORTANT.
453,ep168,"THAT'LL HELP BE A DECIDING FACTOR, I THINK."
454,ep168,A VIEW WOULD BE NICE...
455,ep168,A VIEW WOULD BE NICE...
456,ep168,AND IF WE CAN GET A VIEW...
457,ep168,AND IF WE CAN GET A VIEW...
458,ep168,"OKAY, WELL, BEFORE WE GET TOO EXCITED I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO IN AND TALK TO THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE."
459,ep168,"BECAUSE, IN THESE DIVISIONS HERE-- THE SUBDIVISIONS-- SOMETIMES THE LOTS MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR..."
460,ep168,"THE CUL-DE-SAC, THE FLAT STREET..."
461,ep168,"SO LET'S GO IN, AND WE'LL GO TO THE SALES OFFICE AND TALK TO THEM AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE."
462,ep168,AND TALK TO THEM AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE.
463,ep168,ALL RIGHT.
464,ep168,ALL RIGHT.
465,ep168,'CAUSE I LIKE THE HOUSE...
466,ep168,"I LIKE THE FAMILY ROOM, I LOVE THE MASTER BATHROOM."
467,ep168,I LOVE THE MASTER BATHROOM.
468,ep168,"BUT I LIKE THE OTHER ONE, TOO."
469,ep168,"BUT I LIKE THE OTHER ONE, TOO."
470,ep168,"YEAH, I KNOW."
471,ep168,"YEAH, I KNOW."
472,ep168,"WELL, MAYBE THIS WILL BE A DECIDING FACTOR, WELL, MAYBE THIS WILL BE A DECIDING FACTOR, BECAUSE IF THERE'S NOTHING AVAILABLE..."
473,ep168,SO LET'S GO CHECK.
474,ep168,SO LET'S GO CHECK.
475,ep168,OKAY. WILL THE COWELLS FINALLY SETTLE ON THIS LAKEFRONT HOME...
476,ep168,OR WILL THEY BE LURED AWAY AGAIN?
477,ep168,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
478,ep168,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
479,ep168,"AFTER A LENGTHY SEARCH, GREG AND KAREN COWELL HAVE DECIDED TO BUY A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED HOME."
480,ep168,"BUT AFTER TOURING MODEL HOUSES IN TWO SEPARATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS, THE COWELLS ARE TORN."
481,ep168,INITIALLY THE FAMILY FOUND A MODEL HOME WITH A FLOOR PLAN THAT INCLUDED A SPACIOUS KITCHEN AND A GREAT MASTER BEDROOM.
482,ep168,BUT THEN THEY STUMBLED UPON A MODEL IN A DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAD AN EVEN BETTER FAMILY ROOM AND A LOCATION MUCH CLOSER TO A LAKE THE FAMILY LOVES.
483,ep168,"IN THE END, THEY DECIDED THAT IF A DESIRABLE LOT NEAR THE LAKE WAS AVAILABLE, THEY'D CALL A HALT TO THEIR PURCHASE OF THE FIRST HOUSE AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF BUYING THE SECOND HOUSE."
484,ep168,"DURING A VISIT TO THE DEVELOPER'S OFFICE, THE COWELLS GET THE NEWS."
485,ep168,THERE'S ONE LOT STILL AVAILABLE ON A CUL-DE-SAC OVERLOOKING THE LAKE.
486,ep168,"WELL, WE HAVE TO GO CHECK IT OUT...."
487,ep168,LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.
488,ep168,"WELL, WE HAVE TO GO CHECK IT OUT...."
489,ep168,LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.
490,ep168,WE DO...
491,ep168,WE DO...
492,ep168,THIS IS SO EXCITING...
493,ep168,"I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT, YOU GUYS."
494,ep168,THIS IS SO EXCITING...
495,ep168,"I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT, YOU GUYS."
496,ep168,"YES, DEFINITELY."
497,ep168,"YES, DEFINITELY."
498,ep168,EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.
499,ep168,YOU'RE RIGHT.
500,ep168,YOU'RE RIGHT.
501,ep168,LET'S HURRY.
502,ep168,LET'S HURRY.
503,ep168,(Suzanne) THE HOUSE ON THIS LOT IS THE MODEL THE COWELLS WANTED.
504,ep168,AND THE HOME IS MUCH CLOSER TO COMPLETION THAN THE FIRST HOUSE THEY WERE CONSIDERING.
505,ep168,WOW! IS A GREAT LOT.
506,ep168,THIS IS A GREAT LOT.
507,ep168,THIS IS GREAT!
508,ep168,I LOVE THE COLORS.
509,ep168,I LOVE THE COLORS.
510,ep168,"I DO, TOO."
511,ep168,"I DO, TOO."
512,ep168,AND THE BRICKWORK...
513,ep168,THIS'LL WORK OUT...
514,ep168,YA LIKE IT?
515,ep168,THIS'LL WORK OUT...
516,ep168,YA LIKE IT?
517,ep168,I THINK THIS IS IT...
518,ep168,I LOVE IT.
519,ep168,I THINK THIS IS IT...
520,ep168,I LOVE IT.
521,ep168,FINALLY... RIGHT...
522,ep168,WE'RE HOMEOWNERS!
523,ep168,FINALLY... RIGHT...
524,ep168,WE'RE HOMEOWNERS!
525,ep168,GREAT! TWO MONTHS LATER THE LAKEFRONT HOME IS COMPLETE...
526,ep168,AND SO IS THE COWELLS' MOVE.
527,ep168,"THOUGH THEIR SEARCH TOOK SOME TIME AND A COUPLE OF UNEXPECTED TWISTS, THE END IS EVEN BETTER THAN THEY HAD HOPED FOR."
528,ep168,(Karen) THE PAINT COLORS AND THE FURNITURE AND THE DéCOR OF THE HOUSE...
529,ep168,I THINK WHAT WE'VE ENVISIONED HAS COME TO FRUITION.
530,ep168,WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE SO FAR.
531,ep168,"(Suzanne) THE NEW KITCHEN HAS ALL THE SPACE THAT THE COWELLS WANTED, AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADD THEIR OWN CUSTOM EXTRAS."
532,ep168,CABINETRY AND EVERYTHING'S COMIN' TOGETHER...
533,ep168,"WE BUILT IN A DRY BAR, WHICH IS VERY NICE."
534,ep168,FOR OUR WINE.
535,ep168,"AND FOR THE 40-INCH TELEVISION WE'VE DONE SOME CUSTOM CABINETRY, AND WE'RE GONNA PUT A STEREOSYSTEM IN THAT."
536,ep168,(Suzanne) UPSTAIRS THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR DAY-TO-DAY LIVING.
537,ep168,(Karen) WE LOVE OUR BEDROOM...
538,ep168,IT'S BIGGER THAN THE PREVIOUS HOUSE.
539,ep168,IT'S BIGGER THAN THE PREVIOUS HOUSE.
540,ep168,YES. LOVE HAVING THE DECK.
541,ep168,"WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TOTALLY UTILIZE IT, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE FURNITURE OUT THERE YET."
542,ep168,BUT WE HAVE...
543,ep168,"EVERY MORNING WE WAKE UP TO THE VIEW, AND EVERY NIGHT WE GO TO SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS OF THE CITY BELOW US."
544,ep168,AND WHO COULD NOT LOVE THE BATHROOM?
545,ep168,"I MEAN, IT'S WONDERFUL."
546,ep168,"I MEAN, IT'S WONDERFUL."
547,ep168,WE CALL IT OUR SIXTH BEDROOM.
548,ep168,WE CALL IT OUR SIXTH BEDROOM.
549,ep168,"PEOPLE SAY THEIR LIVING ROOM IS THE SIZE OF OUR BATHROOM, BUT WE LOVE IT, YOU KNOW, IT'S WONDERFUL."
550,ep168,"(Suzanne) FOR THE COWELLS, DECORATING THE NEW HOME IS A FULL-FAMILY AFFAIR."
551,ep168,(Greg) RYAN AND KATIE HAVE HAD A LOT OF INPUT IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL ROOMS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.
552,ep168,"THEY'VE LOOKED AT THEIR BOOKS AND THEIR SPORT MAGAZINES, AND PICKED AND CHOOSED THE COLOR SCHEMES THAT THEY WANTED."
553,ep168,AND SO THEY'VE HAD DEFINITELY A LOT OF INPUT.
554,ep168,"PLUS, WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF OUR OWN INPUT IN THERE, PLUS, WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF OUR OWN INPUT IN THERE, YEAH."
555,ep168,YEAH. KEEP IT AS CONSERVATIVE AS POSSIBLE.
556,ep168,"(Suzanne) WITH ALMOST ALL THE ROOMS SETTLED INTO, THERE IS ONE THAT IS STILL LEFT TO BE DONE."
557,ep168,RIGHT NOW THE LIVING ROOM IS EMPTY.
558,ep168,IT HAS A TABLE AND A MIRROR AND A BIG TREE IN IT.
559,ep168,BUT OUR PLAN IS TO PUT A BABY GRAND IN THERE AND A COUCH AND JUST THE TABLE.
560,ep168,"MAYBE A LITTLE OTTOMAN OR SOMETHING, BUT VERY SIMPLE..."
561,ep168,THE FOCUS IS REALLY GONNA BE THE PIANO.
562,ep168,IS THIS BEFORE OR AFTER THE LANDSCAPING?
563,ep168,IT GUESS IT'S AFTER THE LANDSCAPING.
564,ep168,"(Suzanne) THERE'S STILL SOME WORK LEFT TO DO, BUT ON THE WHOLE THE COWELLS HAVE SETTLED NICELY INTO THEIR NEW HOME AND THEIR NEW NEIGHBORHOOD."
565,ep168,THE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE KIDS HAS BEEN MINIMAL.
566,ep168,"THE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HAVING TO CHANGE SCHOOLS, ET CETERA, AND THEY'VE MADE FRIENDS ALREADY."
567,ep168,SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT FOR THEM.
568,ep168,IT'S BEEN REALLY MINIMAL ADJUSTMENT.
569,ep168,AND THEY STAYED IN THE SAME SCHOOLS AND JUST MADE MORE FRIENDS.
570,ep168,"THE COWELLS FACED A TOUGH CHOICE WHEN THEY FOUND NOT ONE, BUT TWO GREAT HOMES."
571,ep168,"BUT AFTER EXPLORING ALL THEIR OPTIONS, KAREN AND GREG MADE SURE THAT THEIR DECISION WAS THE RIGHT ONE."
572,ep168,AND NOW THE FAMILY FEELS RIGHT AT HOME.
573,ep168,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
574,ep168,THANKS FOR WATCHING.
575,ep168,"Captioning provided by Scripps Networks, Inc."
576,ep168,"Captioned by Closed Captioning Services Inc, Grand Rapids, MI."
577,ep168,♪♪
640,ep168,WELCOME TO
1,ep169,HOUSE HUNTERS.
2,ep169,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep169,EVER SINCE DR.
4,ep169,"MIMI GREENBERG RETIRED, SHE HAS PUT HER ENERGY INTO FULFILLING LIFETIME DREAMS."
5,ep169,"SO FAR, THIS HAS MEANT TRAVELING ALL OVER THE WORLD."
6,ep169,"BUT MIMI HAS ANOTHER DREAM, AND THAT ONE IS TO LIVE EVERY DAY WITH AN OCEAN VIEW OF HER OWN."
7,ep169,JOIN US AS MIMI SEARCHES FOR A HOME THAT WILL GIVE HER THE VIEW SHE LONGS FOR...
8,ep169,NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
9,ep169,♪♪ MIMI GREENBERG WORKED FOR MANY YEARS AS A PSYCHOLOGIST IN PRIVATE PRACTICE.
10,ep169,HER CAREER LEFT LITTLE TIME FOR HOBBIES LIKE GARDENING AND TRAVEL.
11,ep169,BUT MIMI HAS BEEN MAKING UP FOR IT EVER SINCE HER EARLY RETIREMENT A FEW YEARS AGO.
12,ep169,NOW SHE SPENDS ALMOST HALF HER TIME TRAVELING.
13,ep169,"(Mimi) I'VE BEEN TO FRANCE QUITE A FEW TIMES, UM, BUT I LIKE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S GREAT FOOD, UM, ART, AND UM, JUST A GENERAL APPRECIATION FOR THE FINE ARTS."
14,ep169,"(Suzanne) WHEN SHE'S NOT ON THE ROAD, MIMI LIVES IN A HIGH-RISE URBAN CONDOMINIUM."
15,ep169,SHE SHARES HER HOME WITH ONE CAT NAMED CAPPUCCINO AND ANOTHER ONE NAMED LATTE.
16,ep169,"THE CONDO IS FULL OF ANTIQUES, BUT MIMI DIDN'T GET THEM ON HER TRAVELS."
17,ep169,"AS MUCH AS SHE LOVES BEAUTIFUL THINGS, HER TRIPS ARE MEANT TO BE ADVENTURES, NOT SHOPPING EXPEDITIONS."
18,ep169,(Mimi) THE FURNISHINGS IN MY HOME HAVE ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH MY TRAVELS.
19,ep169,WHAT I BRING BACK FROM MY TRAVELS ARE EDIBLES.
20,ep169,HA-HA! THIS HAPPY WANDERER DOESN'T PLAN TO STOP TRAVELING ANYTIME SOON.
21,ep169,BUT MIMI IS FACING A CHALLENGE THAT IMPACTS JUST ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE.
22,ep169,"MIMI HAS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, A DISORDER THAT AFFECTS BOTH HER BALANCE AND HER MOBILITY."
23,ep169,IT IS SOMETHING THAT MIMI MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHETHER AT HOME OR ABROAD.
24,ep169,SHE HAS MODIFIED HER CURRENT CONDOMINIUM IN WAYS THAT MAKE GETTING AROUND EASIER.
25,ep169,"FOR INSTANCE, THIS HANDICAP-ACCESSIBLE BATHROOM WAS ONCE A CLOSET AND A HALF BATH."
26,ep169,THE MODIFICATIONS MIMI HAS MADE TO HER CONDO MAKE IT A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME.
27,ep169,"BUT IRONICALLY, HER HOME'S BEST FEATURE IS ALSO THE ONE SHE WANTS TO CHANGE."
28,ep169,(Mimi) WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT THE SPACE THAT I'M IN IS THERE'S A FABULOUS VIEW OF THE HILLS.
29,ep169,"AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T GO OUTSIDE, UM, MANY DAYS, AT LEAST I FEEL LIKE I'M OUT THERE WITH THE VIEW."
30,ep169,"(Suzanne) AS MUCH AS MIMI ENJOYS SEEING MOUNTAINS, SHE HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF LIVING NEAR THE OCEAN, AND NOW WANTS TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THIS VIEW WITH ONE OF CRASHING SURF."
31,ep169,"BUT FOR MIMI, FINDING A NEW PLACE TO LIVE ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS FINDING THE PERFECT OCEAN VIEW."
32,ep169,"BECAUSE OF HER DISABILITY, SHE NEEDS A CONDO THAT IS FREE OF STAIRS, WITH HALLWAYS WIDE ENOUGH FOR HER SCOOTER."
33,ep169,SHE ALSO NEEDS A LITTLE ASSISTANCE FROM TIME TO TIME.
34,ep169,"LIVING IN A FULL-SERVICE BUILDING NEAR A BUSINESS DISTRICT IS ALL-IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT ENABLES MIMI TO STAY INDEPENDENT."
35,ep169,"(Mimi) I CAN TAKE MY SCOOTER AND SCOOT TO THE SUPERMARKET, TO THE MOVIES, TO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING THAT I MIGHT WANT TO DO."
36,ep169,SO I CAN BE INDEPENDENT AND TAKE CARE OF MYSELF AND MY NEEDS.
37,ep169,"(Suzanne) IF MIMI MOVES, IT MUST BE TO A BUILDING THAT'S CLOSE TO A COMMERCIAL AREA AND TO A PLACE THAT IS OR CAN BE MADE DISABILITY FRIENDLY."
38,ep169,(Mimi) I WOULD LOVE A SPACE THAT SOME OTHER PERSON WHO HAD NEEDS SIMILAR TO MINE BUILT OUT THE SPACE.
39,ep169,THAT'S NOT VERY LIKELY TO HAPPEN.
40,ep169,"THEN MY NEXT CHOICE WOULD BE JUST GIVE ME AN EMPTY ROOM, RAW SQUARE FOOTAGE, AND LET ME WORK WITH A CONTRACTOR OR AN ARCHITECT WHO WILL BUILD IT OUT TO MY NEEDS."
41,ep169,(Suzanne) MIMI GREENBERG REALIZES THAT FINDING A PLACE THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO HER NEEDS AND HAS A FABULOUS OCEAN VIEW WILL BE A CHALLENGE.
42,ep169,BUT SHE FACES CHALLENGES EVERY DAY AND WELCOMES THIS ONE.
43,ep169,"LIFE IF FINITE, AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND LIVE AT THE OCEAN."
44,ep169,"(Suzanne) WHEN WE COME BACK, WILL MIMI SEE A SPOT ON THE BEACH THAT'S RIGHT FOR HER?"
45,ep169,(Mimi) LOOK AT THE VIEW--YOU'VE GOT BUILDINGS OVER THERE.
46,ep169,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
47,ep169,MIMI GREENBERG HAS SPENT MUCH OF HER RETIREMENT IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE.
48,ep169,"WHEN NOT AT HOME, SHE MIGHT BE SEARCHING FOR A GREAT MEAL IN PARIS OR A SUNNY BEACH ALONG THE COAST OF MEXICO."
49,ep169,BUT MIMI HAS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND MAY SOMEDAY HAVE TO CUT BACK ON HER TRAVELS.
50,ep169,"SO SHE'S DECIDED TO LOOK FOR A NEW HOME, ONE THAT WILL COMBINE THE ADVANTAGES OF CITY LIVING WITH A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE SEA."
51,ep169,"HELPING HER FIND THAT IS REALTOR GLORIA HICKS, WHO SPECIALIZES IN HOUSING FOR THE PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED AND IS WELL AWARE OF MIMI'S SPECIAL NEEDS."
52,ep169,"(Gloria) WE NEED TO HAVE HER SAFE, WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY THERE HELP HER, WE NEED FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO A BATHROOM AND INTO A SHOWER AND NOT RUN INTO THINGS AND HAVE TO BACK IN AND OUT."
53,ep169,"UM, IT'S THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO."
54,ep169,"(Suzanne) BUT GLORIA ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT FOR MIMI GREENBERG, FINDING A NEW HOME MEANS MUCH MORE THAN JUST MEETING HER PHYSICAL NEEDS."
55,ep169,MIMI'S CURRENT HOME DOES THAT.
56,ep169,NOW GLORIA IS TRYING TO HELP MIMI MAKE HER DREAM TO LIVE AT THE BEACH COME TRUE.
57,ep169,MIMI AND GLORIA ARE SETTING OUT TODAY TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND A FULL-SERVICE BUILDING THAT ALSO OFFERS THE MAGNIFICENT OCEAN VIEW MIMI IS LOOKING FOR.
58,ep169,"BECAUSE SHE HAS A FAMILY WHO IS WHEELCHAIR-BOUND, GLORIA OWNS A VAN WITH A LIFT."
59,ep169,THIS MAKES HOUSE HUNTING MUCH EASIER FOR MANY OF HER CLIENTS.
60,ep169,"THE FIRST CONDOMINIUM THE WOMEN PLAN TO TOUR IS IN A BUILDING THAT HAS NO STEPS IN FRONT OF ITS ENTRANCE, AND DOES HAVE AROUND- THE-CLOCK SECURITY."
61,ep169,SO FAR SO GOOD.
62,ep169,"IT'S BEAUTIFUL, MIMI."
63,ep169,"YEAH, IT'S A NICE, CLEAN BUILDING."
64,ep169,"'KAY, 804..."
65,ep169,"THAT'S US, LET'S TRY IT OUT."
66,ep169,"(Gloria) WOW, CHECK OUT THIS VIEW."
67,ep169,"NOW MIMI, IS THIS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR?"
68,ep169,"YEP, IT'S GORGEOUS."
69,ep169,IT IS OUTSTANDING.
70,ep169,"AND YOU KNOW, THE COLORS OF THIS ROOM ARE LIKE THE COLORS OUTSIDE, AREN'T THEY?"
71,ep169,"YEAH, THIS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL."
72,ep169,AND WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THE ACTION ON THE BEACH.
73,ep169,YEP. LET'S CHECK OUT THE OTHER ROOMS.
74,ep169,OKAY. THIS IS YOUR GUEST...
75,ep169,IT'S NICE...
76,ep169,BEAUTIFUL CABINETS.
77,ep169,OH... THE GUEST BATHROOM.
78,ep169,"YEAH, AND IT'S NICE AND WIDE HERE, TOO, SWEETIE."
79,ep169,"YEAH, OKAY."
80,ep169,NICE AND SPACIOUS.
81,ep169,"WELL, IT'S SMALL, BUT FINE FOR A GUEST BATH."
82,ep169,"NOW THIS IS YOUR GUEST BEDROOM, SECOND ONE."
83,ep169,"UM, YA GOT, AGAIN, A NICE VIEW."
84,ep169,"GREAT FOR VISITORS, THEY WOULD LOVE THAT."
85,ep169,"YEAH. LIKE THE VIEW, BUT THE ROOM IS SO SMALL."
86,ep169,"I'M WONDERING IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS WALL DOWN, IF ON THE OTHER SIDE, THERE'S SOMEPLACE TO BUILD OUT TO."
87,ep169,"PROB'LY SO, SWEETIE."
88,ep169,LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
89,ep169,"OKAY. RIGHT, SO THIS IS THE WALL..."
90,ep169,IS THIS A LOAD-BEARING WALL?
91,ep169,"UH-UH, SWEETIE, UH-UH."
92,ep169,THIS IS JUST...
93,ep169,YOU COULD EASILY TAKE THIS DOWN.
94,ep169,OKAY. THEN...
95,ep169,"OH, IT'D BE A FABULOUS SUITE, WOULDN'T IT?"
96,ep169,"WELL, IT WOULD BE A NICE-SIZE ROOM."
97,ep169,BUT LOOK...
98,ep169,LOOK AT THE VIEW.
99,ep169,YOU'VE GOT BUILDINGS OVER THERE.
100,ep169,"AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT, IS IT?"
101,ep169,"OKAY, THAT'S ONE SMALL NEGATIVE..."
102,ep169,"WELL, A BIG NEGATIVE FOR ME..."
103,ep169,"A BIG NEGATIVE, OKAY, HA-HA-HA!"
104,ep169,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S CHECK THIS PART OUT."
105,ep169,THIS IS--FOR US AS PRETTY LADIES--THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
106,ep169,"MMM, GOOD CLEARANCE HERE."
107,ep169,"OH, BUT WE GOT A PROBLEM."
108,ep169,THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK FOR YOU.
109,ep169,"WELL, ALL RIGHT."
110,ep169,LET'S THINK THIS THROUGH.
111,ep169,"'KAY. BECOMES THE ROLL- IN SHOWER, GET RID OF THE TUB, THE JACUZZI."
112,ep169,"ON THE FAR SIDE IS THE COMMODE, RIGHT?"
113,ep169,YOU GOT IT!
114,ep169,"OKAY, ALL RIGHT."
115,ep169,"WELL, THAT GIVES ME A NICE ROLL-IN SHOWER."
116,ep169,HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA COST TO REDO THIS BATHROOM?
117,ep169,"YOU'RE TALKIN' PROB'LY $6,000 TO $8,000."
118,ep169,THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
119,ep169,"WELL, THEN THEY'VE GOTTA COME IN WITH A REAL GOOD PRICE."
120,ep169,"'KAY, CONSIDERING YOU ONLY COOK ONCE A YEAR, LET'S CHECK OUT THIS KITCHEN."
121,ep169,IT'S PRETTY.
122,ep169,"YEAH, IT'S NICE."
123,ep169,"DOUBLE SINK, A DISHWASHER, DOUBLE OVENS..."
124,ep169,IT'S NICE.
125,ep169,"FOR THE AMOUNT OF COOKING I DO, IT'S FINE."
126,ep169,(Suzanne) THE PRICE OF A CONDO SO CLOSE TO THE BEACH IS HIGH TO BEGIN WITH.
127,ep169,"SO WHEN MIMI FINDS OUT THAT THE PRICE IS FIRM, SHE DECIDES TO MOVE ON."
128,ep169,"♪♪ A FEW DAYS LATER, GLORIA TAKES HER TO SEE ANOTHER BUILDING THAT ALSO OFFERS A VIEW OF THE WATER."
129,ep169,(Gloria) SUPPOSEDLY A PHENOMENAL VIEW...
130,ep169,"YIKES, THIS IS REALLY A LONG HALLWAY."
131,ep169,IT SURE IS.
132,ep169,IT'S LIKE A BOWLING ALLEY.
133,ep169,"OKAY, SO WE LEARN TO BOWL."
134,ep169,"OH, LET'S HAVE A LOOK FURTHER, AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THIS UNIT, MIMI."
135,ep169,I THINK MAYBE...
136,ep169,"OH, LOOK AT THAT VIEW."
137,ep169,"HMM, GORGEOUS."
138,ep169,"YEAH, IT REALLY IS."
139,ep169,QUITE NICE.
140,ep169,WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?
141,ep169,HMM... IS LIKE DEAD SPACE.
142,ep169,I'D GET RID OF THE WALLS COMPLETELY.
143,ep169,"BUT OF COURSE, IF THIS IS LOAD-BEARING, THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE A COLUMN."
144,ep169,"WELL, LET'S SEE."
145,ep169,"A COLUMN WOULD BE VERY NICE, IT'D BE GORGEOUS."
146,ep169,"OOOH, LITTLE BATH..."
147,ep169,THIS WILL BE HARD TO WORK WITH.
148,ep169,"IT'S GOT THE SHOWER STALL, WHICH I LIKE, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD BUILD IT OUT TO MAKE IT HANDICAP- ACCESSIBLE."
149,ep169,LET'S SEE WHAT THE BEDROOM LOOKS LIKE.
150,ep169,"WELL, IT'S TINY."
151,ep169,"IT SURE IS, BUT THAT'S OKAY."
152,ep169,WE CAN ALWAYS OPEN UP THIS WALL.
153,ep169,"YEAH, IF IT LEADS INTO THE OTHER BEDROOM."
154,ep169,DOES IT?
155,ep169,"YES, MA'AM, IT DOES, IT'S CONNECTING."
156,ep169,"WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT OUT HERE, 'CAUSE THIS IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT."
157,ep169,"UH... HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM, HON."
158,ep169,THERE'S A WALL WITH WINDOWS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
159,ep169,I DON'T LIKE THAT.
160,ep169,"MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU'RE NEIGHBORS CAN SEE YOU ANYTIME THIS WINDOW'S OPEN, SO IT'S OUT."
161,ep169,"THEY CAN SEE ME, I JUST DON'T WANNA SEE THEM."
162,ep169,"HA-HA-HA! RIGHT, LET'S CHECK OUT THE VIEW."
163,ep169,"OKAY. LOOK AT THIS VIEW, 'KAY?"
164,ep169,"OH, LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A VIEW OF THE WORLD."
165,ep169,"IT'S GREAT IN TERMS OF THE OCEAN BEING OUT THERE, BUT BEFORE YOU SEE THE OCEAN, YOU SEE ALL THESE ROOFTOPS."
166,ep169,WHAT A SHAME!
167,ep169,"IT IS A SHAME, ISN'T IT?"
168,ep169,"ALL RIGHT, THERE'S TOO MANY NEGATIVES HERE."
169,ep169,"YEAH, IT'S REALLY A SHAME."
170,ep169,IT IS A SHAME...
171,ep169,"WELL, LET'S MOVE ON..."
172,ep169,OKAY. FIND IT.
173,ep169,"YIKES, TIGHT SQUEEZE!"
174,ep169,"(Suzanne) WHEN WE COME BACK, WILL MIMI EVER FIND A PLACE THAT REALLY FITS HER LIFESTYLE?"
175,ep169,STAY TUNED.
176,ep169,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
177,ep169,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
178,ep169,MIMI GREENBERG WANTS TO BUY A CONDOMINIUM WITH A TERRIFIC OCEAN VIEW.
179,ep169,"THAT ALONE WOULD BE TOUGH TO FIND, BUT FOR MIMI IT'S EVEN TOUGHER."
180,ep169,"SHE IS PHYSICALLY DISABLED AND MUST FIND A PLACE THAT IS, OR CAN BE, ADAPTED TO HER SPECIAL NEEDS."
181,ep169,TODAY MIMI IS CONDO HUNTING WITH HER REALTOR GLORIA HICKS.
182,ep169,GLORIA HAS HELPED MANY DISABLED PEOPLE FIND NEW HOMES AND THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS THEIR REQUIREMENTS.
183,ep169,"(Gloria) MIMI, THIS IS A GORGEOUS CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX, AND WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF FLOOR PLANS WE'RE GONNA CHECK OUT."
184,ep169,"OKAY. IS AN END UNIT, AND THESE THINGS ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR VIEWS."
185,ep169,OKEY-DOKEY. WHAT WE WANT...
186,ep169,"OH, I LOVE THIS BLEACHED WOOD-- THIS IS NICE."
187,ep169,"YEAH. VERY BRIGHT IN HERE, ISN'T IT?"
188,ep169,"YEAH, I LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS."
189,ep169,"NICE, LIGHT KITCHEN..."
190,ep169,I LIKE THE WOOD BOTH IN THE CABINETRY AND IN THE FLOOR.
191,ep169,"BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, GLORIA?"
192,ep169,THIS IS REALLY TIGHT.
193,ep169,"BECAUSE IF THE REFRIGERATOR'S HERE, I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET IN."
194,ep169,"YOU CAN'T MANEUVER IN HERE, SWEETIE."
195,ep169,"SO, UM..."
196,ep169,OKAY. KITCHEN...
197,ep169,OOO! I LOVE THIS.
198,ep169,"BLINDINGLY BRIGHT, HUH?"
199,ep169,FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOWS...
200,ep169,GORGEOUS. IS NOT SO GORGEOUS.
201,ep169,"GOSH, IF ONLY EVERYTHING FACED THE OCEAN AND DIDN'T FACE THE CITY."
202,ep169,"I MEAN, FOR A CITY VIEW, IT'S SPECTACULAR."
203,ep169,"IT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN END UNIT, THAT'S WHY."
204,ep169,"YEAH, WELL, BUT I DON'T LIVE IN THE DINING ROOM."
205,ep169,I UNDERSTAND.
206,ep169,"OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE BEDROOMS."
207,ep169,"HM... HERE, SMALL BEDROOM HERE, AND THIS IS THE MASTER."
208,ep169,YIKES! THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.
209,ep169,"NO, I CAN'T GET IN HERE."
210,ep169,IT'S A LOVELY UNIT.
211,ep169,"AND MIMI, THERE'S NO WALLS TO KNOCK DOWN AND MOVE."
212,ep169,"BUT I HAVE ANOTHER UNIT WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FLOOR PLAN, SO LET'S GO CHECK THAT ONE OUT."
213,ep169,OKAY. TO THE NEXT.
214,ep169,LET'S CHECK OUT THAT OTHER FLOOR PLAN.
215,ep169,THIS ISN'T QUITE GONNA GET IT.
216,ep169,"♪♪ OKAY, MIMI, I THINK THIS ONE MAY BE MORE TO YOUR SPECIFICATIONS, BECAUSE IT'S UNFINISHED."
217,ep169,GOOD. YOU CAN DO YOUR THING.
218,ep169,WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE OCEAN VIEW.
219,ep169,"ANYWAY, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT."
220,ep169,LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.
221,ep169,"(Suzanne) THE UNIT THEY ARE GOING TO SEE NOW IS UNFINISHED, SO MIMI WOULDN'T BE PAYING FOR FINISH WORK THAT SHE'D HAVE TO RIP OUT ANYWAY."
222,ep169,"ALSO, THE VIEWS CAN VARY A LOT FROM CONDO TO CONDO."
223,ep169,PERFECT OCEAN VIEW.
224,ep169,REAL NICE.
225,ep169,"YOU KNOW WHAT CONCERNS ME, GLORIA, IS THAT AS WE WERE ENTERING, OFF TO THE RIGHT, IF THOSE ARE THE BEDROOMS, THAT'S GONNA BE VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO MANEUVER."
226,ep169,"I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOCK OUT THESE WALLS-- IF NOT THE ENTIRE WALL, THEN AT LEAST HALF OF IT."
227,ep169,"THIS COULD BE REMOVED, EVEN IF THIS HAD TO STAY."
228,ep169,"THIS COULD BE GREAT, YOU COULD MAKE THIS YOU HOME."
229,ep169,"I MEAN, AS FAR AS THE FLOORING AND THE WALLS."
230,ep169,AND THE VIEW IS TO DIE FOR.
231,ep169,LET'S CHECK OUT THIS KITCHEN-- LOOKS GREAT TOO.
232,ep169,BEAUTIFUL GOURMET KITCHEN.
233,ep169,WHERE I WILL NEVER COOK!
234,ep169,HA-HA-HA! MAYBE THIS WILL BE A...
235,ep169,THIS... THIS IS FINE.
236,ep169,"BECAUSE THERE ARE NO APPLIANCES, WHICH MEANS THAT THAT I CAN BRING MY APPLIANCES, WHICH ARE AS GOOD AS NEW."
237,ep169,SAVES MONEY.
238,ep169,"WELL, MIMI, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, TOO."
239,ep169,"YEAH, IT IS."
240,ep169,"IT'S NICE AND LIGHT, I LIKE THE LIGHT WOOD."
241,ep169,OKAY. YOU CAN FUNCTION WELL IN THERE.
242,ep169,YOU'VE GOT JUST ENOUGH SPACE TO MOVE AROUND.
243,ep169,"'KAY, LET'S CHECK OUT THE REST OF THIS HOUSE."
244,ep169,YIKES... SQUEEZE.
245,ep169,"YEAH, IT'S VERY TIGHT, MIMI."
246,ep169,BUT WE HAVE PROBABLY A GOOD SIX INCHES.
247,ep169,WE COULD OPEN THIS DOORWAY UP.
248,ep169,OKAY. VIEW'S WONDERFUL.
249,ep169,"OH, IT IS."
250,ep169,"FROM YOU BEDROOM, WHAT A WONDERFUL VIEW."
251,ep169,YEP. LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT GOIN' HERE.
252,ep169,"GOT A LOT OF CLOSET SPACE, MIMI."
253,ep169,"UM, WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE, I CAN SEE NOW."
254,ep169,"WATER CLOSET'S OVER HERE, YOU'RE SHOWER'S OVER HERE, AND YOU GOT A TINY LITTLE AREA THERE, SO THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MODIFIED."
255,ep169,LOOKS TO ME LIKE EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE GUTTED IN HERE.
256,ep169,I CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE AREA.
257,ep169,THE BATHTUB IS ESSENTIALLY USELESS.
258,ep169,"YEAH, IT IS, BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL."
259,ep169,"IT'S PRETTY, BUT IT'S NOT FOR YOU, HON."
260,ep169,"YEAH, IT'S VERY WELL DONE, BUT NOT TO MY SPECIFIC NEEDS."
261,ep169,OKAY. RIGHT.
262,ep169,♪♪ NICE PLACE.
263,ep169,"YEAH, I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE."
264,ep169,"I THINK MAYBE WE HAVE, LIKE, A POSSIBILITY HERE."
265,ep169,"YEAH I LIKE THE IDEA THAT THERE'S NO FLOORING DOWN, BECAUSE I CAN PUT IN WHATEVER FLOORING I WANT, I CAN PUT IN WHATEVER APPLIANCES."
266,ep169,THIS WAY I CAN PUT IN WHAT I WANT FROM THE BEGINNING.
267,ep169,I AGREE.
268,ep169,THIS IS A GOOD ONE.
269,ep169,"YEAH. RIGHT, ONWARD."
270,ep169,(Suzanne) HERE IS A UNIT THAT MIGHT JUST WORK.
271,ep169,"BESIDES A BATHROOM THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MODIFIED AND SOME PARTIAL WALLS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED, THE CONDOMINIUM SUITS HER."
272,ep169,WILL MIMI REPLACE HER CURRENT VIEW OF THE HILLS WITH ONE OF THE OCEAN?
273,ep169,FIND OUT WHEN WE COME BACK.
274,ep169,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
275,ep169,MIMI GREENBERG HAS SEEN BEAUTIFUL OCEAN VIEWS FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC TO THE CARIBBEAN.
276,ep169,NOW SHE WANTS A VIEW SHE CAN ENJOY FULL TIME AND IS LOOKING FOR A HOME THAT WILL GIVE HER THAT.
277,ep169,HELPING MIMI WITH HER SEARCH IS HER REALTOR GLORIA HICKS.
278,ep169,TOGETHER THEY HAVE SCOURED THE COASTLINE IN THEIR HUNT FOR A DISABILITY-FRIENDLY BUILDING.
279,ep169,THEIR LATEST OUTING HAS BROUGHT THEM TO AN UNFINISHED UNIT THAT MEETS MANY OF MIMI'S NEEDS.
280,ep169,"(Gloria) WELL, MIMI, WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF GOOD THINGS, AND THIS ONE WAS THE CLOSEST ONE SO FAR."
281,ep169,"WHAT DO YOU THINK-- HOW DO YOU FEEL, AND DO YOU WANNA MAKE AN OFFER?"
282,ep169,"(Mimi) CLOSE, BUT NOT ON THE TARGET."
283,ep169,"YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T SEEN ONE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR."
284,ep169,"YOU KNOW, EITHER THEY'VE GOT THE WHITEWATER VIEWS BUT IT'S TOO SMALL, OR THE LAYOUT ISN'T RIGHT."
285,ep169,"WE JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT COMBINATION, AND I'M THINKING MY OWN PLACE IS LOOKING BETTER AND BETTER."
286,ep169,"(Gloria) WELL, THEN MIMI, WE DON'T MAKE A MOVE."
287,ep169,I WANT YOU TO BE IN LOVE WITH YOUR HOME.
288,ep169,THIS IS WHAT BUYING A HOME IS ALL ABOUT.
289,ep169,"BUY A HOME IS TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, IS TO IMPROVE, DEFINITELY NOT TO LOWER YOUR STANDARDS."
290,ep169,(Suzanne) GLORIA'S WORDS HIT HOME.
291,ep169,"AND AFTER TAKING A GOOD LONG LOOK AT WHAT'S OUT THERE, MIMI HAS DECIDED NOT TO BUY A BEACHFRONT CONDO AFTER ALL."
292,ep169,BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE PLANS TO STAY PUT.
293,ep169,"MY PLAN IS TO TRAVEL, UH, PROBABLY THE SAME AMOUNT THAT I WAS TRAVELING BEFORE."
294,ep169,I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE CONDO OF MY DREAMS WAS GOING TO COST.
295,ep169,"AND IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO, DO I WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY AND NOT BE ABLE TO TRAVEL BUT HAVE THIS TERRIFIC CONDO, OR DO I WANT TO TRAVEL WHILE I CAN AND THEN, WHEN I CAN'T TRAVEL ANYMORE, TAKE THAT MONEY AND BUY."
296,ep169,AND THAT'S THE DECISION I'VE MADE.
297,ep169,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH SHE'S MADE UP HER MIND TO CONTINUE TRAVELING INSTEAD OF MOVING TO A BEACHFRONT CONDO, MIMI'S HOUSE HUNT HAS HAD SEVERAL UNFORESEEN BENEFITS."
298,ep169,"(Mimi) WHILE I WAS LOOKING FOR THE CONDOMINIUM OF MY DREAMS, I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO UPGRADE MY PRESENT CONDOMINIUM AND MAKE IT MORE HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE, SO THAT WHEN I SOLD IT, I WOULD SELL IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WAS DISABLED."
299,ep169,SO I MADE MODIFICATIONS THAT I NOW HAVE COME TO REALIZE WERE PERFECTLY FOR ME.
300,ep169,I'VE WIDENED THE DOORWAYS SO THAT THE SCOOTER CAN GET THROUGH WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE SEVERAL BROKEN TURNS.
301,ep169,"AND I FIXED UP THE GARDEN ON THE BALCONY SO THAT IF I HAVE TO BE IN BED ALL DAY, I CAN LOOK AT A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN AS WELL AS A BEAUTIFUL VIEW."
302,ep169,"I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M ECSTATIC THAT I DIDN'T FIND THE CONDO OF MY DREAMS, BUT I CAN SAY THAT LOOKING MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH I LOVE THE PLACE THAT I'M LIVING IN NOW, AND HOW MUCH I HAVE MADE IT MY HOME."
303,ep169,"AND I CAN LIVE HERE, ENJOY MYSELF, TRAVEL AS MUCH AS I WANT."
304,ep169,I'M LEAVING FOR MEXICO TOMORROW.
305,ep169,"I'M GOING TO CANCúN TO SNORKEL, AND I'M GOING TO BE DOING A LOT OF SNORKELING, AND I'M GOING TO TAKE SCUBA DIVING LESSONS, SO I'LL BE TRAVELING A LOT."
306,ep169,"BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT I'VE MADE MY CHOICE, AND THAT IS, AS LONG AS I'M GOING TO STAY HERE, I'M GONNA GET MY OCEAN ON VACATIONS."
307,ep169,GLORIA TOLD MIMI THAT BUYING A HOME SHOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY.
308,ep169,WHAT MIMI REALIZED IS THAT NOT BUYING A HOME WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY.
309,ep169,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
310,ep169,THANKS FOR WATCHING.

1,ep170,TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
2,ep170,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
3,ep170,ALEX AND MARIA ROMERO AND THEIR TWO YOUNG SONS HAVE JUST BEEN RELOCATED TO A NEW CITY.
4,ep170,"THE ROMEROS NEED TO FIND A HOME TO BUY QUICKLY, BUT IT MUST BE LARGE ENOUGH, IN THEIR PRICE RANGE AND IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH GOOD SCHOOLS AND PARKS."
5,ep170,"WILL THE ROMEROS FIND A HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEIR FAMILY, IN A CITY THEY DON'T KNOW?"
6,ep170,IT'S ALL NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
7,ep170,♪♪ ♪♪ I LIKE THIS ONE.
8,ep170,"YEAH, THAT ONE LOOKS NICE."
9,ep170,"(Suzanne) JUST DAYS AFTER BEING TRANSFERRED TO A NEW CITY BY HIS JOB, ALEX ROMERO AND HIS WIFE MARIA ARE ON A MISSION TO BUY A HOME."
10,ep170,"THE COUPLE AND THEIR TWO YOUNG SONS, FRANCISCO AND VICTOR, ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN A FURNISHED APARTMENT."
11,ep170,"THE TEMPORARY LIVING ARRANGEMENT IS MAKING THE FAMILY FEEL RESTLESS, AND THE COUPLE IS FEELING THE PRESSURE TO FIND A HOUSE QUICKLY."
12,ep170,ADDING TO THEIR ANXIETY IS THE FACT THAT IN FOUR DAYS ALEX WILL LEAVE ON A BUSINESS TRIP THAT WILL KEEP HIM OUT OF TOWN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.
13,ep170,"IF THE ROMEROS DON'T FIND AN IDEAL HOME BEFORE ALEX LEAVES, THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT ALMOST A MONTH BEFORE RENEWING THEIR SEARCH."
14,ep170,WE'LL NEED TO REALLY GET A LOT DONE EVERY DAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HOUSES.
15,ep170,FINDING A HOME SOON IS A REAL PRIORITY FOR ME.
16,ep170,I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DISPLACED RIGHT NOW.
17,ep170,WE'RE LIVING IN A TEMPORARY APARTMENT.
18,ep170,"AND SINCE I TRAVEL SO MUCH, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT MY WIFE AND THE KIDS HAVE A HOME THAT THEY'RE HAPPY IN."
19,ep170,THIS APARTMENT DEFINITELY DOES NOT COMPARE TO OUR HOUSE WHERE WE USED TO LIVE.
20,ep170,IT'S SO SMALL.
21,ep170,THE KIDS DON'T HAVE A YARD TO PLAY.
22,ep170,THEY CANNOT RIDE THEIR BICYCLES.
23,ep170,WE DON'T HAVE ALL OUR STUFF HERE.
24,ep170,(Suzanne) LIVING IN A FURNISHED APARTMENT WITH ALL THEIR PERSONAL BELONGINGS IN STORAGE IS ALSO AFFECTING THEIR COMFORT LEVEL.
25,ep170,"(Alex) I THINK WE'RE HANDLING LIVING HERE IN CONFINED SPACE PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THINGS THAT YOU'RE USED TO, OR NOT HAVING THE ROOM TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE USED TO IS, IT'S DEFINITELY STRESSFUL."
26,ep170,"(Suzanne) VICTOR AND FRANCISCO, FULL OF KID ENERGY, ARE FEELING ESPECIALLY COOPED UP HERE."
27,ep170,"THE BOYS ARE PACKED INTO ONE BEDROOM, WHERE THE ONLY PET THEY HAVE ROOM FOR IS A HERMIT CRAB."
28,ep170,"(Maria) THE KIDS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT FINDING A HOUSE WITH A BIG BACKYARD, AND WITH A BIG PLACE WHERE THEY CAN PLAY."
29,ep170,"THEY ARE TIRED OF BEING IN THIS APARTMENT, SHARING ONE BEDROOM WITH ALL THEIR TOYS."
30,ep170,SO THEY CAN HARDLY WAIT UNTIL THEY GET INTO A NEW HOUSE.
31,ep170,"(Suzanne) IN THE NEW HOUSE, THE ROMEROS ARE HOPING THERE WILL BE MORE ROOM FOR EVERYONE."
32,ep170,BUT MARIA AND ALEX KNOW THAT THE HOUSE IN THE NEW CITY IS GOING TO OFFER A LOT LESS THAN THE ONE THEY LEFT BEHIND.
33,ep170,"(Alex) BEFORE WE MOVED HERE, I TOLD MARIA THAT THE AREA THAT WE'RE MOVING TO IS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE CAME FROM, THAT THE HOUSES TENDED TO BE SMALLER, THE YARDS TENDED TO BE SMALLER, AND EVERYTHING WAS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE, SO I TRIED TO GET HER READY FOR THAT."
34,ep170,"(Suzanne) AS A STAY-AT-HOME MOM WITH TWO ACTIVE KIDS, MARIA HAS SOME MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR A NEW HOME."
35,ep170,"WE ARE LOOKING FOR A HOUSE THAT HAS AT LEAST THREE BEDROOMS, TWO BATHROOMS, DEFINITELY A BACKYARD, A DINING ROOM, A BREAKFAST ROOM, LIVING ROOM, LAUNDRY ROOM, KITCHEN."
36,ep170,"BUT THREE BEDROOMS, TWO BATHROOMS AND A BACKYARD IS A MUST IN A HOUSE."
37,ep170,"(Suzanne) THE SIZE OF THE ROMEROS CURRENT KITCHEN IS LESS THAN IDEAL, AND ONLY REINFORCES THE FAMILY'S NEED FOR MORE SPACE."
38,ep170,"WITH MARIA AND ALEX FEELING CRAMPED, AND THE BOYS GROWING RESTLESS, THE CLOCK IS TICKING FOR THE ROMEROS TO FIND A HOME."
39,ep170,"I THINK OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLE'S GONNA BE THAT WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO LOOK FOR A HOME, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRIORITIZE AND BE VERY EFFICIENT IN EVALUATING THE HOMES THAT WE LOOK AT."
40,ep170,"SO OUR OBSTACLE, WITHOUT A DOUBT, IS TIME."
41,ep170,"(Suzanne) NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS, THE ROMEROS START THEIR SEARCH."
42,ep170,WILL THEY FIND A HOME BEFORE ALEX LEAVES TOWN?
43,ep170,I STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANOTHER HOUSE OR A COUPLE OF HOUSES.
44,ep170,(Suzanne) OR WILL THEIR SEARCH BE DELAYED ANOTHER MONTH?
45,ep170,FIND OUT WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS.
46,ep170,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
47,ep170,"MARIA AND ALEX ROMERO HAVE JUST RELOCATED TO A NEW CITY, AND ARE LIVING IN A CRAMPED, TEMPORARY APARTMENT."
48,ep170,"BUT WITH TWO RAMBUNCTIOUS KIDS, THE ROMEROS ARE EAGER TO FIND A HOME WHERE THEY CAN ALL SPREAD OUT."
49,ep170,"THE FAMILY IS SHORT ON TIME, HOWEVER, AS ALEX TRAVELS OFTEN, AND HE WANTS THE FAMILY TO FIND A HOME BEFORE HE'S CALLED OUT OF TOWN AGAIN."
50,ep170,THAT GIVES THE ROMEROS JUST THREE DAYS TO FIND A HOME THAT THEY'LL BE HAPPY WITH.
51,ep170,"LUCKILY, THE ROMEROS HAVE REALTOR MARY ALLEN ON THEIR SIDE."
52,ep170,"MARY SPECIALIZES IN HELPING FAMILIES TRANSITION TO NEW CITIES, AND IT'LL BE HER JOB TO HELP THE FAMILY FIND A HOME QUICKLY, WITHOUT SACRIFICING THEIR HOME FEATURE WISH LIST."
53,ep170,"(Mary Allen) MY ADVICE TO THE ROMEROS, AS THEIR PROFESSIONAL REAL ESTATE AGENT, IS TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND, HAVE VISION WHEN YOU GO INTO THE DIFFERENT HOMES THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE, SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE A COMPARISON ON VALUE."
54,ep170,"(Suzanne) WITH THIS IN MIND, MARY WANTS TO SHOW THE COUPLE A GOOD CROSS SECTION OF THE HOMES IN THEIR PRICE RANGE."
55,ep170,"ON THEIR FIRST DAY OUT, MARY HAS BEEN SHOWING THE COUPLE HOMES THAT ARE PRICED AT THE LOW END OF THEIR RANGE."
56,ep170,"SO FAR, ALL THE HOMES THE COUPLE HAS SEEN TODAY ARE TOO SMALL FOR THEIR NEEDS."
57,ep170,"BUT MARY THINKS THIS HOME, THE LAST ONE ON THEIR LIST FOR TODAY, IS A GOOD SIZE FOR THE FAMILY AND HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL."
58,ep170,(Mary) THIS IS A NICE ROOM...
59,ep170,IT'S BRIGHT.
60,ep170,HAVE A BATCHELDER FIREPLACE WITH A WOOD MANTEL.
61,ep170,"(Suzanne) MARIA AND ALEX LIKE THE OLD-WORLD CHARACTER AND THE SIZE OF THIS LIVING ROOM, AND THE FACT THAT THE HOME HAS ROOM FOR A FORMAL DINING ROOM."
62,ep170,MARIA IS HOPING THAT SAME SPACIOUSNESS EXTENDS TO THE REST OF THE HOME.
63,ep170,"WHILE THE BOYS CHECK OUT THE BEDROOMS, ALEX AND MARIA TAKE IN THE ALL-IMPORTANT KITCHEN."
64,ep170,(Mary) THE KITCHEN.
65,ep170,"ONE NICE THING, IT HAS A NICE BREAKFAST AREA."
66,ep170,"(Alex) YEAH, A BREAKFAST AREA WOULD WORK."
67,ep170,THE BEDROOMS ARE THIS WAY.
68,ep170,I THINK THE BOYS ALREADY FOUND THE BEDROOMS.
69,ep170,"OKAY, ONE BEDROOM HERE."
70,ep170,"WELL, IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK, BUT OUR FURNITURE WOULD FIT IN HERE."
71,ep170,"(Suzanne) IDEALLY, THE ROMEROS WOULD LIKE TO FIND A HOUSE THAT DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF UPDATING, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THIS HOME WOULD REQUIRE SOME FIXING UP BEFORE THEY WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING IN."
72,ep170,LET'S GO FIND THE BOYS.
73,ep170,"OKAY. DO YOU THINK, HONEY..."
74,ep170,THIS LOOKS LIKE THE BOYS' ROOM.
75,ep170,I STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANTHER HOUSE OR A COUPLE OF HOUSES.
76,ep170,IT HAS POSSIBILITIES.
77,ep170,WE'LL LOOK SOME MORE.
78,ep170,"LET'S GO, BOYS."
79,ep170,"COME ON, BOYS."
80,ep170,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH THIS HOUSE HAS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THEY NEED AND A LAYOUT THEY LIKE, MARIA AND ALEX HOPE THAT ANOTHER DAY OF SEARCHING WILL YIELD A HOME IN THEIR PRICE RANGE THAT WON'T REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES."
81,ep170,"THE NEXT DAY, ALEX AND MARIA HEAD OUT FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF HOUSES."
82,ep170,"IT'S IN A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD, AND IT'S ALSO IN A GOOD SCHOOL DISTRICT."
83,ep170,IT HAS A GOOD SCHOOL.
84,ep170,"OKAY, WE'LL SEE."
85,ep170,"(Suzanne) SHORT ON TIME, THEY DECIDE TO LEAVE THE BOYS AT HOME SO THEY CAN COVER MORE GROUND."
86,ep170,"THIS HOUSE IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE HOMES THE COUPLE TOURED YESTERDAY, SO ALEX AND MARIA ARE HOPING THAT IT WILL REQUIRE FEWER COSTLY IMPROVEMENTS."
87,ep170,(Mary) THE LIVING ROOM DOES HAVE A FIREPLACE.
88,ep170,(Maria) THIS IS KIND OF SMALL FOR OUR FURNITURE.
89,ep170,(Alex) AND THE CEILINGS AREN'T REAL TALL EITHER.
90,ep170,"(Suzanne) BECAUSE ALEX AND MARIA HAVE A COLLECTION OF LARGE FURNITURE PIECES, TALL CEILINGS AND LARGE WINDOW SPACES ARE A MAJOR REQUIREMENT."
91,ep170,"WITH THE HOME'S THREE BEDROOMS AND TWO BATHS, ITS OVERALL SIZE IS APPEALING."
92,ep170,"AND THIS ROOM, MARY?"
93,ep170,MASTER SUITE.
94,ep170,"WOW, LOOK AT THIS ROOM."
95,ep170,THIS IS A NICE MASTER BEDROOM.
96,ep170,THIS IS VERY NICE.
97,ep170,BIG! A NICE SIZE.
98,ep170,I LIKE IT.
99,ep170,"WELL, IF YOU LIKE THIS, I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THE KITCHEN."
100,ep170,"OKAY, LET'S GO AND SEE THE KITCHEN."
101,ep170,"WOW, THIS KITCHEN IS NOT BAD."
102,ep170,IT'S THE BEST KITCHEN WE HAVE SEEN.
103,ep170,LOOK AT THIS.
104,ep170,NICE SINK.
105,ep170,IT HAS NEW APPLIANCES.
106,ep170,"NICE SPACE, COUNTER."
107,ep170,"OH, LOOK, A TRASH COMPACTOR."
108,ep170,I WOULD REPLACE THE HANDLES...
109,ep170,I REALLY DON'T LIKE THEM.
110,ep170,THIS IS A NICE KITCHEN.
111,ep170,I LIKE IT.
112,ep170,"(Suzanne) THIS HOME FULFILLS MARIA'S REQUIREMENT OF A LARGE KITCHEN, HOWEVER, IT HAS A SMALL LOT AND LACKS A TRUE BACKYARD."
113,ep170,"EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE IS GOOD, THE ABSENCE OF A BIG YARD FOR THE BOYS TO PLAY IN IS TOO MUCH OF A DRAWBACK."
114,ep170,(Alex) THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO HAVE.
115,ep170,(Suzanne) SO THE ROMEROS MOVE ON.
116,ep170,"(Alex) THIS IS A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD, MARY."
117,ep170,IT'S NICE.
118,ep170,"THERE'S A SCHOOL A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY, AND THERE'S A PARK AROUND THE CORNER."
119,ep170,"(Suzanne) AS THEY NEAR THE END OF THEIR SECOND DAY OF HOUSE HUNTING, THE ROMEROS ARE ALSO APPROACHING THE END OF THE LIST OF AVAILABLE HOMES."
120,ep170,"THEIR FINAL HOUSE FOR THE DAY IS AT THE HIGH-END OF THEIR PRICE RANGE, SO THEY'RE HOPEFUL IT WILL BE LARGE AND MOVE-IN READY."
121,ep170,A LIVING ROOM WITH NICE WINDOWS.
122,ep170,"I KNOW THE FORMAL DINING ROOM, THE CERAMIC TILE, YOU MAY NOT CARE FOR, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD CHANGE."
123,ep170,"THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE IS GOOD, THOUGH."
124,ep170,"OKAY. WITH OVER 1800 SQUARE FEET, THIS HOME OFFERS THE SPACIOUS FLOOR PLAN THAT ALEX AND MARIA WERE LOOKING FOR, BUT DOES IT INCLUDE A LARGE AND MODERN KITCHEN?"
125,ep170,HERE WE ARE IN THE KITCHEN.
126,ep170,"HARDWOOD CABINETS, DISHWASHER."
127,ep170,"I DO KNOW THAT YOU WANTED A KITCHEN WITH A BREAKFAST AREA, BUT YOU DO HAVE A BREAKFAST BAR OVER HERE AND THE CERAMIC TILE FLOORING."
128,ep170,SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
129,ep170,(Maria) OUR REFRIGERATOR WILL NOT FIT IN THERE.
130,ep170,I AGREE.
131,ep170,NEED MORE CABINET SPACE ALSO?
132,ep170,"YEAH, THE KITCHEN'S A BIG PART OF OUR HOUSE."
133,ep170,"(Suzanne) MARIA AND ALEX ARE UNIMPRESSED BY THE KITCHEN, AND BECAUSE THIS HOME IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE OTHERS THEY'VE SEEN, REMODELING WOULD NOT BE FINANCIALLY POSSIBLE."
134,ep170,THERE'S A BEDROOM HERE.
135,ep170,(Maria) THE BEDROOM IS TOO SMALL.
136,ep170,"YEAH, IT APPEARS A LITTLE BIT SMALL."
137,ep170,"(Suzanne) ALTHOUGH THIS HOME DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S THE ONE, THE GROUP CONTINUES THEIR TOUR."
138,ep170,EVERY ROOM THEY SEE ADDS TO MARY'S KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE COUPLE'S GENERAL LIKES AND DISLIKES.
139,ep170,(Mary) NOW THIS THE FAMILY ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE.
140,ep170,"THE SIZE OF THE ROOM IS REAL GOOD, THOUGH."
141,ep170,IT'S A NICE-SIZED ROOM.
142,ep170,"DEFINITELY A POSITIVE POINT OF THE HOUSE, CLOSE TO THE KITCHEN."
143,ep170,"I KNOW, I COULD BE COOKING, AND THE KIDS COULD BE PLAYING HERE."
144,ep170,THAT WOULD BE NICE.
145,ep170,(Suzanne) THE NEXT STOP IS THE BACKYARD.
146,ep170,"OKAY, LET'S GO."
147,ep170,"(Suzanne) WITH TWO ACTIVE CHILDREN, A LOT OF SPACE IS IMPORTANT TO MARIA AND ALEX, BUT SO IS AN ACCEPTABLE BACKYARD."
148,ep170,SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS YARD?
149,ep170,(Maria) I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL!
150,ep170,A LOT OF CONCRETE.
151,ep170,TOO MUCH CONCRETE?
152,ep170,"NOT REAL PRACTICAL FOR THE KIDS, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU."
153,ep170,"(Suzanne) NEEDING A NUMBER OF COSMETIC CHANGES AND LACKING A GRASSY BACKYARD, THE ROMEROS DECIDE THAT THIS HOUSE WOULD BE TOO IMPRACTICAL."
154,ep170,"WITH ALEX'S BUSINESS TRIP LOOMING, THE ROMEROS HAVE ONE LAST DAY TO FIND A HOME THEY'LL BE HAPPY IN."
155,ep170,WILL THEIR FINAL DAY OF LOOKING PRESENT THEM WITH A NEW OPTION?
156,ep170,(Suzanne) OR WILL IT BRING THEM BACK TO SQUARE ONE?
157,ep170,IT'S ALL NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
158,ep170,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS...
159,ep170,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
160,ep170,ALEX AND MARIA ROMERO AND THEIR TWO YOUNG SONS ARE RECENT TRANSPLANTS TO A NEW CITY.
161,ep170,THE FAMILY IS RACING TO FIND A HOME BEFORE ALEX HAS TO GO ON A BUSINESS TRIP.
162,ep170,"AND ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING, THEY'RE DISCOURAGED BY WHAT THEY'VE SEEN."
163,ep170,"AT THIS POINT, ALEX AND MARIA HAVE TOURED ALL OF THE HOMES IN THEIR PRICE RANGE."
164,ep170,BUT EACH OF THE HOMES THEY'VE SEEN SO FAR WOULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES.
165,ep170,"WITH TIME RUNNING SHORT, THEY MUST QUICKLY EVALUATE THE HOMES THEY'VE SEEN."
166,ep170,"THIS HOUSE, WHICH THE COUPLE SAW ON THEIR FIRST DAY OUT, HAD THE MOST POTENTIAL."
167,ep170,SO THE ROMEROS HAVE ASKED REALTOR MARY ALLEN TO SHOW IT TO THEM ONCE MORE.
168,ep170,"BECAUSE THIS HOUSE HAD THE LOWEST ASKING PRICE, THE ROMEROS COULD AFFORD TO RENOVATE IT TO FIT THEIR NEEDS."
169,ep170,HERE WE ARE AGAIN.
170,ep170,(Alex) WELL...
171,ep170,"YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS A LOT NICER TODAY, MARY."
172,ep170,IT REALLY DOES.
173,ep170,"AFTER LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES AVAILABLE, THE POSSIBILITIES HERE LOOK A LOT MORE PROMISING."
174,ep170,"(Suzanne) SEEING THE HOME AGAIN ONLY EMPHASIZES WHAT ORIGINALLY ATTRACTED THE ROMEROS TO THIS HOUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE, NAMELY THE OLD-WORLD CHARM AND THE SIZE."
175,ep170,WHAT ABOUT THE FURNITURE?
176,ep170,IT LOOKS LIKE IT'D FIT HERE.
177,ep170,YES. BIG FURNITURE WILL FIT IN HERE.
178,ep170,"YEAH, ALL OUR FURNITURE IN THE LIVING ROOM WILL FIT HERE."
179,ep170,THE THIRD BEDROOM.
180,ep170,"PLENTY OF ROOM, A LOT OF LIGHT, WINDOW SPACE."
181,ep170,THIS WILL BE OUR GUEST BEDROOM.
182,ep170,YEAH. WORK.
183,ep170,"ACTUALLY, OUR FURNITURE IS THE SAME COLOR."
184,ep170,"YEAH, A GOOD- SIZE ROOM."
185,ep170,THIS WOULD BE FINE FOR THE GUEST ROOM FURNITURE.
186,ep170,LET'S GO LOOK AT THE KITCHEN AGAIN.
187,ep170,"OKAY. WITH A SPACIOUS KITCHEN AT THE TOP OF BOTH ALEX AND MARIA'S WISH LIST, THEY WANT TO REEVALUATE THE ROOM'S POTENTIAL."
188,ep170,"YEAH, IT DOESN'T REACH OUT AND GRAB YOU, BUT AT LEAST IT'S GOOD SIZED."
189,ep170,"WHAT DO YOU THINK, HONEY?"
190,ep170,I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
191,ep170,I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS.
192,ep170,"OKAY. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE LARGEST KITCHEN THE ROMEROS HAVE SEEN SO FAR, MARIA WANTS A NEWER KITCHEN."
193,ep170,I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
194,ep170,"OKAY. WHILE MARIA CONTINUES TO THINK ABOUT THE KITCHEN, THE TOUR CONTINUES TO THE BATHROOM."
195,ep170,THIS IS A GOOD- SIZE BATHROOM.
196,ep170,THE TUB LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOOD SIZE.
197,ep170,PERFECT FOR THE KIDS.
198,ep170,YEAH. LIKE IT.
199,ep170,(Suzanne) THEN ALEX AND MARIA DO A THOROUGH ONCE-OVER ON THE THINGS THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT AS CLOSELY THE FIRST TIME.
200,ep170,"THEY NOTICE THE CHARACTER DETAILS OF THE HOUSE, LIKE THE FIREPLACE TILES, WOOD FRAME WINDOWS AND SOME GREAT HARDWOOD FLOORS."
201,ep170,BUT IT'S THE HOME'S BACKYARD THAT MAY BE THE DECIDING FACTOR.
202,ep170,"OH, LOOK, HONEY, IT'S AS BIG AS WE REMEMBERED."
203,ep170,"YEAH, THE KIDS' PLAYGROUND IS GOING TO FIT IN HERE."
204,ep170,"YEAH, PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THAT."
205,ep170,THE BACKYARD'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.
206,ep170,"WITHOUT A DOUBT, IT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR."
207,ep170,"A NICE DETACHED GARAGE, JUST LIKE WE REMEMBERED."
208,ep170,"OKAY, NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN THE HOUSE A SECOND TIME, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
209,ep170,I LIKE THE LIVING ROOM.
210,ep170,IT'S A GOOD-SIZED LIVING ROOM.
211,ep170,I THINK OUR FURNITURE WILL FIT.
212,ep170,"I LIKE THE DINING ROOM, THE BATHROOM."
213,ep170,"THE PLUSES OUTWEIGH THE MINUSES, HONEY."
214,ep170,SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WANT TO DO?
215,ep170,"LET'S DO IT, MARY."
216,ep170,"OKAY, THAT'S GREAT."
217,ep170,LET'S MAKE A BID.
218,ep170,LET'S GO BACK TO THE OFFICE.
219,ep170,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT."
220,ep170,"(Suzanne) HAPPY WITH THEIR DECISION, THE ROMEROS DRAW UP AN OFFER WITH VISIONS OF THEIR NEW HOME ALREADY FILLING THEIR IMAGINATIONS."
221,ep170,"WITH ALEX SET TO LEAVE TOWN IN A DAY, WILL THE ROMEROS' OFFER BE ACCEPTED IN TIME, OR WILL THEY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT MONTH TO BEGIN THEIR SEARCH AGAIN?"
222,ep170,FIND OUT NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
223,ep170,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
224,ep170,"AFTER A WHIRLWIND SEARCH IN A NEW CITY, MARIA AND ALEX ROMERO AND THEIR SONS HAVE FINALLY FOUND A HOME THAT SUITS THEIR NEEDS."
225,ep170,THEY'VE PUT IN AN OFFER AND ARE NOW WAITING FOR A CALL FROM THEIR REALTOR.
226,ep170,THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT LONG FOR THE ANSWER.
227,ep170,HELLO. HOW YOU DOING?
228,ep170,"WELL, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?"
229,ep170,(Suzanne) THE RESULT IS IN AND JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.
230,ep170,"THE MORNING BEFORE ALEX LEAVES TOWN, THE FAMILY FINDS OUT THAT THEY GOT THE HOUSE."
231,ep170,WE DID?
232,ep170,YEAH. BOYS.
233,ep170,"REMEMBER THAT HOUSE WE WENT TO GO LOOK AT, THE ONE WITH THE JUNGLE..."
234,ep170,YOU REMEMBER IT?
235,ep170,YEAH! WHAT?
236,ep170,WHAT? GONNA BE MOVING THERE...
237,ep170,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
238,ep170,YEAH! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?
239,ep170,"YEAH! IN JUST SIX WEEKS, THE ROMEROS MOVED IN."
240,ep170,"AND AFTER MONTHS OF RENOVATIONS, THEY ARE NOW HAPPY WITH THEIR NEW HOME."
241,ep170,"(Alex) WE'VE BEEN HERE NOW FOR THREE MONTHS, AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OF HARD WORK."
242,ep170,"THE REMODELING PROCESS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL, BUT NOW THAT IT'S DONE, AND NOW THAT WE'RE CLOSE TO COMPLETION, IT REALLY IS ALL WORTH IT."
243,ep170,WE'RE HAPPY HERE.
244,ep170,THE HOUSE IS BUILT THE WAY WE WANT IT BUILT FOR OUR NEEDS.
245,ep170,"SO AFTER IS ALL SAID AND DONE, WE'RE VERY HAPPY."
246,ep170,"(Suzanne) AS MARIA AND ALEX PREDICTED, THE KITCHEN WAS THE BIGGEST RENOVATION THEY HAD TO TACKLE."
247,ep170,"(Maria) WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE KITCHEN, IT WAS VERY SMALL."
248,ep170,IT WASN'T FUNCTIONAL AT ALL.
249,ep170,"SO WE JUST OPENED THE KITCHEN, AND NOW IT'S VERY FUNCTIONAL."
250,ep170,"(Alex) THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST PROJECT, AND THEN THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT WE STARTED."
251,ep170,"SINCE OUR FAMILY ROTATES AROUND ON THE KITCHEN, WE DECIDED TO TACKLE THE KITCHEN FIRST, AND TAKE IT FROM THERE."
252,ep170,"MARIA DESIGNED THE KITCHEN, THOUGH, AND I THINK IT CAME OUT REAL NICE."
253,ep170,"(Suzanne) AFTER MOVING A WALL, ADDING NEW CABINETS AND A FRESH COAT OF PAINT, AND LAYING DOWN HARDWOOD FLOORS, THE KITCHEN IS EVERYTHING THE ROMEROS WANTED."
254,ep170,THEY'VE ALSO FINE-TUNED THE BATH FOR THEIR FAMILY'S NEEDS.
255,ep170,"(Maria) WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE BATHROOM, THERE WAS NO PLACE TO PUT A TOWEL, NO STORAGE AREA, NOTHING."
256,ep170,"SO NOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF CABINET SPACE AND A PLACE TO PUT YOUR TOWEL, MIRRORS."
257,ep170,"I MEAN, WE ALL CAN BE IN THE BATHROOM JUST GETTING READY OR WHATEVER, AND WE HAVE A PLACE FOR EVERYBODY TO BE THERE."
258,ep170,"(Suzanne) WHILE THE ROMEROS WERE INITIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT SPACE, EVERYTHING FITS PERFECTLY."
259,ep170,"(Maria) BECAUSE OUR FURNITURE IS SO BIG, WE DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GOING TO FIT IN THE HOUSE."
260,ep170,BUT IT FIT JUST PERFECT.
261,ep170,(Suzanne) THE BOYS WERE SO HAPPY SHARING A ROOM IN THE TEMPORARY APARTMENT THAT THEY DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE ARRANGEMENT.
262,ep170,"THEY BOTH LOVE THEIR NEW ROOM, AS WELL AS THEIR LARGE BACKYARD."
263,ep170,"(Maria) THE KIDS NOW CAN PLAY THERE, SPEND THEIR AFTERNOONS THERE."
264,ep170,"SO THEY ARE HAPPY KIDS, PLAYING OUTSIDE."
265,ep170,"(Suzanne) WHEN LOOKING AT THIS HOME ORIGINALLY, THE ROMEROS COULD SEE BEYOND WHAT THEY CONSIDERED THE HOME'S MINUSES AND IMAGINED THE POTENTIAL EACH ROOM HAD."
266,ep170,"INITIALLY WE WEREN'T REALLY SOLD ON THE HOUSE, BUT AFTER TALKING WITH THE REAL ESTATE AGENT AND MAKING SOME COMPARISONS, WE REALIZED THAT WE COULD, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HARD WORK, MAKE THE HOUSE SOMETHING THAT WE CREATED AND SOMETHING THAT WE COULD REALLY APPRECIATE."
267,ep170,"SO IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK, A HEADACHE HERE AND THERE, BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT."
268,ep170,WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE HOUSE.
269,ep170,AND WE REALLY ANTICIPATE LIVING HERE A LONG TIME.
270,ep170,"ALTHOUGH THE ROMEROS HAD TO CONDENSE THEIR SEARCH INTO THREE SHORT DAYS, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE ALL THE TIME THEY NEEDED."
271,ep170,"ALEX AND MARIA WERE ABLE TO LOOK BEYOND THE HOUSE'S IMPERFECTIONS, AND WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION, THEY'VE CREATED THEIR PERFECT HOME."
272,ep170,I'M SUZANNE WHANG...
273,ep170,THANKS FOR JOINING US ON HOUSE HUNTERS.

3,ep171,FRED AND MARILEE KARLSEN ARE FINALLY READY TO FULFILL THEIR DREAM OF LIVING BY THE BEACH.
4,ep171,"RECENTLY RETIRED AND WITH THEIR KIDS GROWN AND GONE, IT'S A BITTERSWEET EXPERIENCE FOR THE KARLSENS TO LEAVE THEIR HOME OF 27 YEARS."
5,ep171,"THEY HAVE ALREADY FOUND THE PERFECT LOCATION, AND NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO FIND THE PERFECT HOUSE."
6,ep171,JOIN THEM ON THEIR SEARCH...
7,ep171,NEXT ON HOUSE HUNTERS.
8,ep171,♪♪ WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
9,ep171,WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
10,ep171,"CUTTIN', CUTTIN', CUTTIN'..."
11,ep171,"CUTTIN', CUTTIN', CUTTIN'..."
12,ep171,THAT'S ALL YOU EVER DO AROUND HERE.
13,ep171,"(Suzanne) FRED AND MARILEE KARLSEN LIKE THEIR CURRENT HOME, BUT THEY WANT TO MOVE NEAR THE BEACH TO A PLACE THAT REQUIRES LESS MAINTENANCE."
14,ep171,(Marilee) WE'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR 27 YEARS.
15,ep171,"OUR CHILDREN GREW UP HERE, AND NOW THEY ARE AWAY, AND THEY HAVE FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN."
16,ep171,"WE HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER FROM ONE SON, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GRANDSON SOON FROM ANOTHER SON, SO WE'RE KIND OF EMPTY-NESTERS, WHICH WE HAVE BEEN FOR QUITE A WHILE."
17,ep171,"(Suzanne) FRED AND MARILEE RAISED THEIR FAMILY IN THIS BEAUTIFUL HOME, BUT WITH THE KIDS GONE, THEY BOTH AGREE IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON."
18,ep171,"THEY DON'T NEED AS MANY ROOMS, AND THEY NO LONGER WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A POOL AND A LARGE YARD."
19,ep171,"(FRED) ONE OF THE THINGS WE'D LIKE TO FIND IN A NEW HOME WOULD BE, FOR EXAMPLE, NO SWIMMING POOL, SO WE DON'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A SWIMMING POOL THAT WE HAVEN'T USE, UCH IN YEARS."
20,ep171,WE USE ONLY WHEN OUR CHILDREN AND GRAND- DAUGHTER ARE HERE...
21,ep171,"WE WOULD LIKE TO AVOID THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GROUNDS, OF HAVING A GARDENER."
22,ep171,"WE'D LIKE TO FIND, IN OUR OWN WAY, SIMPLIFYING OUR LIFESTYLE A LITTLE BIT, WHICH MEANS HAVING A HOME THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THIS HOME BUT LAID OUT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND WITH FEWER RESPONSIBILITIES."
23,ep171,"(Suzanne) SMALLER IS GOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE KITCHEN."
24,ep171,MARILEE WANTS A BIGGER KITCHEN.
25,ep171,"(Marilee) NOW FRED IS RETIRED AND WE SPEND MORE TIME IN THE KITCHEN COOKING TOGETHER, THE SPACE IN OUR KITCHEN IS A LITTLE TIGHT FOR THAT, AND WE TEND TO BUMP UP AGAINST EACH OTHER MORE, SO TO PROMOTE PEACE IN OUR MARRIAGE, WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE SPACE WHERE WE CAN, YOU KNOW, CREATE MORE IN THE KITCHEN."
26,ep171,"(Suzanne) LIVING BY THE BEACH IS ANOTHER ESSENTIAL, AND FRED AND MARILEE HAVE ALREADY SET THEIR MINDS ON AN AREA KNOWN FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL BEACH HOMES."
27,ep171,"SINCE THE KARLSENS ARE ALSO AVID TRAVELERS, BUYING A LOW-MAINTENANCE HOME, WHERE THE BEACH IS THEIR BACKYARD, WOULD ALLOW THEM THE FREEDOM TO GET AWAY MORE OFTEN."
28,ep171,(Fred) WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN OUR LIVES IS THAT WE HAVE A LIFESTYLE CHANGE.
29,ep171,OUR LIFESTYLE CHANGE INVOLVES GETTING A NEW HOME AND MOVING TO A NEW AREA.
30,ep171,BUT IT'S A LIFESTYLE CHANGE THAT GOES BEYOND THAT.
31,ep171,"IT'S EMPHASIZED, FOR US, BY THE FACT THAT WE'VE BOTH RECENTLY RETIRED FROM OUR PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES."
32,ep171,"SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A NEW HOME IS A PART AND PARCEL OF A CHANGE IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE'VE LIVED OUR LIVES, WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN EVOLVING SLOWLY AS THE CHILDREN HAVE LEFT OUR HOUSE, AND WE BEGAN TO TRAVEL, AND THINGS LIKE THAT."
33,ep171,BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A WHOLE CHANGE IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE SPEND OUR DAILY ACTIVITIES.
34,ep171,"(Suzanne) FRED AND MARILEE BOTH AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT LEAVING A HOUSE FULL OF SO MANY MEMORIES WON'T BE EASY."
35,ep171,(Fred) I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DO HAVE SOME BITTERSWEET FEELINGS ABOUT MOVING IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS HOUSE FOR SO VERY LONG.
36,ep171,"I THINK THAT MOST FAMILIES MOVE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE HAVE, SO ANY CHANGE LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE."
37,ep171,"BUT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY AND IF WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF HOUSE, THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF A MOVE."
38,ep171,AND WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO IT AS AN EXCITING AND DIFFERENT PHASE OF OUR LIVES.
39,ep171,(Suzanne) UP NEXT...
40,ep171,"FRED AND MARILEE STRUGGLE WITH THE IDEA OF LEAVING THEIR OLD HOME BEHIND, AND BEGIN THEIR SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME THAT WILL FIT THEIR NEEDS..."

47,ep171,"(Ty) BECAUSE THE KARLSENS HAVE LIVED IN THE HOME THAT THEY CURRENTLY OWN FOR SO MANY YEARS, I KNEW THAT A LIFESTYLE CHANGE TO THEM PROBABLY MEANS THAT THEY'RE GONNA LIVE IN THIS NEW HOME FOR QUITE A WHILE, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT MOVE EVERY WEEK."

96,ep171,IT FEELS TIGHT TO ME.
97,ep171,"(Suzanne) UNLIKE THE KITCHEN, THE MASTER SUITE AND THE REST OF THE HOUSE IS REALLY TOO BIG FOR THE KARLSEN'S NEEDS."
98,ep171,"ALTHOUGH THE VIEW FROM THE BALCONY IS LOVELY, THE HOME DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO FRED AND MARILEE."

100,ep171,AND I JUST THINK IT'S MORE THAN WE WANT AT THIS STAGE IN OUR LIVES.
101,ep171,AT THIS STAGE IN OUR LIVES.
102,ep171,"OKAY. I UNDERSTAND, AND THE NEXT HOME I'M GONNA SHOW YOU IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER THAN THIS, SO WE'LL GO TO THERE AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK."

299,ep171,"NO-NO-NO-NO, NO."
300,ep171,"NO-NO-NO-NO, NO."
301,ep171,I JUST SPOKE WITH THE OTHER BROKER.
302,ep171,"I WAS LETTING HIM KNOW THAT WE HAD INTERESTED CLIENTS, AND WE WERE WRITING UP AN OFFER."
303,ep171,HE DID INDICATE THAT ANOTHER OFFER HAS COME IN ON THE PROPERTY.
304,ep171,NORMALLY... ALREADY?
305,ep171,(Fred) ALREADY?
306,ep171,"ALREADY... MEAN, THIS IS REALLY AN EXCEPTIONAL PROPERTY, AND SO OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT."
307,ep171,"AND NORMALLY I WOULD SAY MAYBE WE COULD START A LITTLE BIT LOWER WITH OUR OFFER AND FIND A NEUTRAL POINT, BUT NOW THAT THERE'S ANOTHER OFFER, IT PUTS A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE ON."
308,ep171,SO I WANT TO ABSOLUTELY GET YOU THE BEST PRICE FOR THE HOUSE-- I JUST THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO COME IN A LITTLE BIT STRONGER.
309,ep171,AND WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF IT FADING AWAY.
310,ep171,"IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE HOUSE, I WANNA SEE YOU GET IT."
311,ep171,"(Suzanne) THE PRESSURE IS ON, BUT NOW THAT FRED AND MARILEE HAVE PUT THEIR DOUBTS ASIDE, THEY ARE READY TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE HOUSE THEY WANT."
312,ep171,"WELL, I THINK WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW YOUR RECOMMENDATION."
313,ep171,"WE WANT MAKE AN OFFER THAT'S STRONG ENOUGH THAT IT WILL GARNER SERIOUS ATTENTION FROM THE SELLER, BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY MONEY ON THE TABLE."

315,ep171,(Suzanne) UP NEXT...
316,ep171,"THE KARLSENS WAIT TO SEE IF THE SELLERS WILL APPROVE THEIR OFFER, WHEN HOUSE HUNTERS RETURNS."
317,ep171,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
318,ep171,MARILEE AND FRED KARLSEN KNOW THEY FOUND THE PERFECT HOUSE.
319,ep171,"THEY'VE PUT ASIDE THEIR DOUBTS ABOUT MOVING, AND ARE NOW ANXIOUSLY HOPING THAT THE SELLERS WILL ACCEPT THEIR OFFER."
320,ep171,"THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN SPENDING TIME AT THE BEACH NEAR THE NEW HOUSE, BUT THEY'RE GETTING TIRED OF MAKING THE DRIVE FROM THEIR OLD HOME."
321,ep171,"THEY'RE ALSO ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE NEWS ON THEIR OFFER FROM THEIR REALTOR, TY BERGMAN."
322,ep171,"THEY'RE SO ANXIOUS, IN FACT, THAT THEY DECIDE TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE AND CALL TO SEE WHETHER TY HAS GOTTEN ANY NEWS."
323,ep171,"AS IT TURNS OUT, THEY'RE TIMING IS PERFECT."
324,ep171,WE GOT IT!
325,ep171,WE GOT IT!
326,ep171,"OKAY! AND MARILEE ARE THRILLED TO GET THE HOUSE, AND THEY WASTE NO TIME MOVING IN."
327,ep171,"GETTING THEIR NEW PLACE FURNISHED, HOWEVER, TURNS OUT TO BE A SLOW PROCESS, BECAUSE THE KARLSENS' OLD HOUSE STILL HASN'T SOLD."
328,ep171,"AFTER TWO MONTHS IN THEIR NEW HOME, THE KARLSENS STILL HAVE SEVERAL EMPTY ROOMS."
329,ep171,"(Marilee) OUR FURNITURE IS STILL AT THE OLD HOUSE, AND WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AROUND AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS IN THE OLD HOUSE THAT WE WANNA TAKE TO THIS HOUSE."
330,ep171,"RIGHT NOW WE'RE KING OF ENJOYING THE SPACE, AND KIND OF, YOU KNOW, ALMOST WILL FEEL LIKE IT'S INTRUSIVE TO HAVE ANY FURNITURE."
331,ep171,BUT I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FURNITURE.
332,ep171,WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO FURNISH THIS HOUSE MORE COMPLETELY...
333,ep171,"PUT SOME RUGS DOWN AFTER WE GET THE FURNITURE, AND SO ON."
334,ep171,"BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S KINDA FUN THIS WAY, TOO."
335,ep171,(Suzanne) THE KARLSENS ARE CONSTANTLY AMAZED AT THE AMOUNT OF ROOM THEIR NEW HOUSE HAS TO OFFER.
336,ep171,"APART FROM THE SPACIOUS DINING ROOM AND LIVING ROOM, MARILEE'S STUDY ON ON THE SECOND FLOOR COMES COMPLETE WITH A BUILT-IN DESK."
337,ep171,NATURAL LIGHT BRIGHTENS HER WORKSPACE.
338,ep171,AND THE LARGE CLOSET BOASTS MORE THAN ENOUGH ROOM TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF FRED AND MARILEE'S CLOTHES.
339,ep171,"THE KARLSENS AREN'T IN ANY HURRY, AND THEY'VE DISCOVERED THAT THEIR NEW HOUSE IS PERFECT FOR THE KIND OF CASUAL RELAXATION THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO."
340,ep171,THEY ESPECIALLY LOVE THEIR SPACIOUS NEW KITCHEN.
341,ep171,(Marilee) IT IS REALLY WONDERFUL.
342,ep171,AND I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW MUCH WE WOULD ENJOY IT.
343,ep171,"FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S TONS OF CUPBOARD SPACE, AND I EVEN HAVE SOME SHELVES THAT I HAVEN'T FILLED YET."
344,ep171,BUT THE COUNTER SPACE IS FANTASTIC.
345,ep171,"WHY, WE CAN CHOP AND LOOK AT TV AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS SOMETHING NEW FOR US."
346,ep171,"IT'S VERY CASUAL AND VERY NICE, IT REALLY IS."
347,ep171,IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL.
348,ep171,"(Suzanne) EVEN THOUGH HE'S RETIRED, FRED APPRECIATES HAVING A HOME OFFICE WHERE HE CAN MANAGE PERSONAL BUSINESS."
349,ep171,(Fred) IT'S REALLY THE KIND OF RETIREMENT THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE.
350,ep171,"THAT IS, I DON'T SIT AROUND AND LOOK FOR THINGS TO DO."
351,ep171,"AND EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SEEING CLIENTS ANYMORE, I CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO KEEP ME BUSY AND TO KEEP MY MIND OCCUPIED."
352,ep171,"(Suzanne) FRED AND MARILEE ALSO ENJOY A LEISURELY RUN BY THE BEACH EVERY DAY, TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE BEAUTY OF THEIR NEW LOCATION."
353,ep171,"(Marilee) MAYBE MOVING TO A NEW HOUSE FORCES US TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WILL KEEP US MORE STIMULATED."
354,ep171,AND THEREFORE YOUNGER!
355,ep171,THE KARLSENS ARE LIVING THEIR DREAM OF RETIRING BY THE BEACH.
356,ep171,"THEY STILL HAVEN'T SAID A FINAL GOOD-BYE TO THEIR OLD HOME, BUT THEY ARE SO HAPPY WITH THEIR NEW PLACE THAT LETTING GO NOW SEEMS EASY."

93,ep172,"SO IT'S A VERY OPEN PLAN, WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU LIKE, YES?"
94,ep172,"WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU LIKE, YES?"
95,ep172,YEAH. YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE IT.
96,ep172,WE CAN CHOOSE THE CABINETS?
97,ep172,"(Alice) YEAH, THAT'S WHAT'S NICE."
98,ep172,I HAVE SOME BOOKLETS OVER HERE WE CAN LOOK AT TOO.
99,ep172,SO THROUGH HERE IS THE MASTER.
100,ep172,"THIS IS A REALLY NICE SUITE WITH A FULL BATH, WALK-IN CLOSET."
101,ep172,"WITH A FULL BATH, WALK-IN CLOSET."
102,ep172,NICE. LIKE THE SKYLIGHTS THAT THEY DO.
103,ep172,"YEAH, IT'S VERY AGAIN--HIGH- VAULTED CEILINGS-- ARCHITECTURAL."
104,ep172,WHAT I THOUGHT MAYBE WOULD BE RIGHT FOR YOU GUYS.
105,ep172,(Suzanne) MARIA AND FRANCISCO ARE INTRIGUED BY THE DESIGN OF THIS HOUSE.
106,ep172,"THE VERTICAL SPACE AND LIGHT, AS WELL AS THE OPEN FLOOR PLAN ARE CHARACTERISTICS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR."
107,ep172,(Francisco) THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR MY OFFICE.
108,ep172,(Maria) BUT DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE READY IN A MONTH?
109,ep172,I DON'T THINK SO.
110,ep172,"WELL, THERE IS A LOT TO DO YET ON IT."
111,ep172,BUT I THINK IT COULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO WORK FOR YOU.
112,ep172,THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING MIGHT WORK.
113,ep172,I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL HAVE THE TIME TO WORK ON IT.
114,ep172,I'D RATHER FIND SOMETHING THAT ALREADY FITS US.
115,ep172,"(Suzanne) DECIDING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT FOR THIS HOUSE TO BE COMPLETED, THE GROUP MOVES ON TO ANOTHER MODERN-STYLE HOME, BUT THIS TIME, ONE THAT IS FINISHED."
116,ep172,SO COME ON IN...
117,ep172,TAKE A LOOK.
118,ep172,IT'S A VERY LARGE SPACE WITH MANY LEVELS.
119,ep172,"THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM, OBVIOUSLY."
120,ep172,IT'S GOT THESE NICE SLATE FLOORS.
121,ep172,HOW MANY LEVELS IS THIS HOUSE?
122,ep172,THREE LEVELS AND A ROOF DECK.
123,ep172,YOU WANT TO GO LOOK AT THE KITCHEN?
124,ep172,"IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN, ALL COMPLETELY CUSTOM."
125,ep172,THIS REALLY IS QUITE A BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN.
126,ep172,"(Francisco) THIS IS THE MAIN DINING ROOM, RIGHT?"
127,ep172,"YEAH, THAT'S THE FORMAL DINING ROOM."
128,ep172,I SEE.
129,ep172,AND WHAT'S OUT HERE?
130,ep172,THIS IS THE OTHER GARDEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?
131,ep172,"YEAH, THERE IS ANOTHER OFFICE SPACE, BUT IT'S CONNECTED HERE BY THIS NICE OUTSIDE PATIO."
132,ep172,"THIS IS THE BACKYARD, AS YOU CALL IT?"
133,ep172,"YEAH, THIS IS THE BACK PATIO."
134,ep172,"YOU HAVE THAT FRONT AREA AS WE WALKED IN, AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS REALLY NICE COURTYARD, WITH, YOU SEE A KOI POND."
135,ep172,VERY ORIGINAL.
136,ep172,VERY ORIGINAL.
137,ep172,"YEAH, ISN'T IT CHARMING?"
138,ep172,"YEAH, ISN'T IT CHARMING?"
139,ep172,"PRETTY DANGEROUS FOR FRANKIE, NO?"
140,ep172,"WELL, THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE FOR HIM."
141,ep172,HE'S SO YOUNG.
142,ep172,HE'S SO YOUNG.
143,ep172,"YEAH. SEE THERE'S OTHER LEVELS, THOUGH."
144,ep172,MAYBE WE CAN GO UP AND SEE WHAT'S UPSTAIRS.
145,ep172,MAYBE WE CAN GO UP AND SEE WHAT'S UPSTAIRS.
146,ep172,"OKAY, LET'S CHECK IT OUT."
147,ep172,"OKAY, LET'S CHECK IT OUT."
148,ep172,"(Suzanne) A KOI POND FOR A BACKYARD IS NOT IDEAL FOR A YOUNG COUPLE WITH A SMALL CHILD, BUT THE HOUSE ITSELF DOES HAVE SOME THINGS GOING FOR IT."
149,ep172,SO WE GO UP ANOTHER LEVEL HERE TO THE MASTER.
150,ep172,THIS IS VERY SPACIOUS AND NICE.
151,ep172,I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THIS.
152,ep172,IT HAS GOOD LIGHT TOO.
153,ep172,I LOVE IT WHEN A HOUSE HAS GOOD SUNLIGHT.
154,ep172,SO HERE'S THE MASTER BEDROOM.
155,ep172,FULL OF LIGHT.
156,ep172,FULL OF LIGHT.
157,ep172,"YES. HERE WE ARE ON THE TOP LEVEL, SO YOU GET ALL THIS WONDERFUL LIGHT UP HERE."
158,ep172,DO YOU SEE THE OCEAN HERE?
159,ep172,YOU DO HAVE THIS LITTLE WALKOUT BALCONY HERE.
160,ep172,"(Suzanne) THE HOUSE IS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE THE OCEAN, AND THE VIEW IS MOSTLY OF OTHER HOUSES."
161,ep172,"THE OPEN AND AIRY MASTER BATH IS IMPRESSIVE, BUT FRANCISCO AND MARIA ARE DISAPPOINTED BY THE FACT THAT THE HOUSE HAS NO REAL YARD."
162,ep172,"IT'S NICE, WITH ALL THE LIGHT."
163,ep172,HAS A VIEW TOO.
164,ep172,"MY ONLY CONCERN IS THE LACK OF YARD, BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS COOL."
165,ep172,"YEAH, THE HOUSE WORKS."
166,ep172,"(Suzanne) WHILE THE PUGLIESES CONSIDER THE LAST HOUSE, ALICE TAKES THEM TO THE NEXT HOME ON THE AGENDA, A DUPLEX CLOSER TO THE OCEAN."
167,ep172,(Alice) SO THEY'RE JUST SWITCHING THIS TO BE THE MODEL.
168,ep172,THIS IS THE NEW DEVELOPMENT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
169,ep172,"AND THESE ARE ALL BRAND-NEW HOMES, AND THEY'RE READY TO MOVE INTO."
170,ep172,AND THEY'RE READY TO MOVE INTO.
171,ep172,"GOOD SPACE, HUH?"
172,ep172,"GOOD SPACE, HUH?"
173,ep172,AND THIS IS A NICE PRETTY GOOD-SIZE LOFT SPACE.
174,ep172,I THOUGHT MAYBE IT COULD WORK AS AN OFFICE.
175,ep172,I LIKE THE HIGH CEILINGS.
176,ep172,"(Alice) SO COME ON OUT HERE, AND SEE, THIS IS A VERY SPACIOUS ROOF DECK."
177,ep172,HERE'S WHERE YOU REALLY SEE THE VIEW.
178,ep172,"BUT THIS IS WHAT I DON'T LIKE, TO BE SO CLOSE TO OUR NEIGHBORS."
179,ep172,"WELL, YEAH, YOU DO HAVE THAT WHEN YOU GET THESE LOCATIONS."
180,ep172,"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
181,ep172,I'M REALLY HEARING THAT A YARD IS SO IMPORTANT.
182,ep172,"IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LET ME TRY A DIFFERENT AREA, I THINK WE COULD MAYBE REALLY MAKE A CHANGE IN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING."
183,ep172,IN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING.
184,ep172,"YEAH, I THINK SO."
185,ep172,"YEAH, I THINK SO."
186,ep172,BUT I'M GLAD YOU SAW THIS.
187,ep172,"IT'S GOOD TO SEE EVERYTHING, 'CAUSE YOU START REALLY FEELING WHAT YOU REALLY NEED."
188,ep172,"YEAH, YOU CAN GET PERSPECTIVE."
189,ep172,"YEAH, YOU CAN GET PERSPECTIVE."
190,ep172,"EXACTLY. WITH A BETTER IDEA ABOUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT, FRANCISCO AND MARIA CONTINUE THE HUNT."
191,ep172,WILL THEY HAVE ANY LUCK...
192,ep172,"NEXT, ON HOUSE HUNTERS."
193,ep172,IT SOUNDS GOOD.
194,ep172,IT SOUNDS GOOD.
195,ep172,"YEAH, IT COULD BE."
196,ep172,"YEAH, IT COULD BE."
197,ep172,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS...
198,ep172,I'M SUZANNE WHANG.
199,ep172,MARIA AND FRANCISCO PUGLIESE NEED A BIGGER HOME.
200,ep172,THEY WOULD LIKE AN ARCHITECTURALLY INTERESTING HOUSE WITH A BIG YARD AND HOPEFULLY A NICE VIEW.
201,ep172,"SO FAR, NOTHING'S BEEN JUST RIGHT."
202,ep172,BUT MARIA HAPPENS TO FIND AN AD IN THE PAPER FOR A HOUSE THAT SHE THINKS THEY SHOULD SEE.
203,ep172,WHICH ONE?
204,ep172,WHICH ONE?
205,ep172,THIS ONE.
206,ep172,THIS ONE.
207,ep172,WE SHOULD GO AND SEE IT.
208,ep172,IT'S JUST TEN MINUTES FROM HERE.
209,ep172,IT'S TWO MORE EXITS.
210,ep172,IT'S TWO MORE EXITS.
211,ep172,WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
212,ep172,WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?
213,ep172,"FOUR BEDROOMS, THIS HAS FOUR BEDROOMS."
214,ep172,"FOUR BEDROOMS, THIS HAS FOUR BEDROOMS."
215,ep172,IT HAS A YARD.
216,ep172,IT HAS A YARD.
217,ep172,IT HAS A WALK-IN CLOSET...
218,ep172,I LOVE THAT.
219,ep172,LET'S GO AND SEE IT.

221,ep172,IT SOUNDS GOOD.
222,ep172,LET'S CHECK IT OUT...
223,ep172,LET'S GO.
224,ep172,(Suzanne) MARIA AND FRANCISCO CALL THEIR REAL ESTATE AGENT ALICE PLATO AND ASK HER TO NOTIFY THE SELLERS SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THE HOME.
225,ep172,"AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THIS BEAUTIFUL ONE-STORY HOUSE IS JUST AS APPEALING IN PERSON AS THE AD SUGGESTED."
226,ep172,"OH, IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL."
227,ep172,COME ON IN.
228,ep172,"OH, WOW."

240,ep172,"(Francisco) WE DID A GOOD THING OF COMING TO SEE IT, HUH?"
241,ep172,"YEAH, AND THE KITCHEN IS HUGE."
242,ep172,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE COLOR OF THE CABINETS.
243,ep172,"THEY'RE WOOD, THOUGH."
244,ep172,YOU COULD PAINT THEM QUITE EASILY.
245,ep172,THAT WOULD BE NOT TOO MUCH TO DO.
246,ep172,THAT WOULD BE NOT TOO MUCH TO DO.
247,ep172,'CAUSE THE REST OF THE HOUSE IS SO WHITE.
248,ep172,'CAUSE THE REST OF THE HOUSE IS SO WHITE.
249,ep172,"WHERE EVERYTHING IS SO MODERN, I SEE."
250,ep172,"YEAH, MAYBE WHITE WOULD BE PRETTY."
251,ep172,AND THAT'D BE AN EASY FIX TO DO.
252,ep172,THIS COULD BE A PERFECT ROOM FOR FRANKIE.
253,ep172,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
254,ep172,WHAT DO YOU THINK?
255,ep172,"IT COULD BE, YEAH."
256,ep172,"IT COULD BE, YEAH."

259,ep172,A LOT OF LIGHTS.
260,ep172,A LOT OF LIGHTS.
261,ep172,"I DON'T KNOW IF HE WOULD APPRECIATE, BEING SO YOUNG, THIS VIEW."
262,ep172,"NICE YARD SPACE, TOO, OUTSIDE THE WINDOW HERE."
263,ep172,"NICE YARD SPACE, TOO, OUTSIDE THE WINDOW HERE."
264,ep172,YEAH. VERY NICE ROOM.
265,ep172,"AND HERE'S A BATH, A NICE-SIZE BATH--LOOK."
266,ep172,A SEPARATE SHOWER AND TUB.
267,ep172,SO THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO AND A HALF BATHROOMS.

269,ep172,"AND AGAIN, IT HAS A VIEW AGAIN."
270,ep172,EVERY ROOM'S GOT A VIEW.

337,ep172,IT'S PRICED REALLY WELL.
338,ep172,IT'S PRICED WELL FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

345,ep172,"I'LL CALL THE OTHER AGENT, AND LET'S GET IT FOR YOU, OKAY?"
346,ep172,"(Suzanne) THE SELLER'S DECISION COULD MEAN THE PERFECT HOUSE FOR THE PUGLIESES, OR IT COULD MEAN GOING BACK TO SQUARE ONE."
347,ep172,STAY WITH US.
348,ep172,HELLO... ALICE.
349,ep172,HOW ARE YOU...
350,ep172,SO YOU GOT SOME NEWS?
351,ep172,♪♪ WELCOME BACK TO HOUSE HUNTERS.
352,ep172,AN AD IN THE NEWSPAPER LED FRANCISCO AND MARIA PUGLIESE TO THE PERFECT HOUSE.
353,ep172,"UNFORTUNATELY, THEY AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO WANT IT."
354,ep172,SO THE COUPLE SUBMITTED AN OFFER AND ARE NOW HOPING FOR THE BEST.
355,ep172,REALTOR ALICE PLATO HAS PROMISED TO CALL ONCE THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE.
356,ep172,(speaking Argentinean) HELLO...
357,ep172,"HELLO, ALICE."
358,ep172,HOW ARE YOU...
359,ep172,SO YOU GOT SOME NEWS?
360,ep172,I HAVE FANTASTIC NEWS...
361,ep172,"HELLO, I'M YOU GOT THE HOUSE!"
362,ep172,"OH, DON'T TELL ME..."
363,ep172,YEAH? HOLD A ONE SECOND...
364,ep172,I'M WITH MY MOM ON THE OTHER LINE.
365,ep172,I WANT TO TELL HER THIS...
366,ep172,HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
367,ep172,MAMA! FRANCISCO SHARES THE WONDERFUL NEWS WITH HIS MOTHER-- THEIR OFFER HAS BEEN EXCEPTED.
368,ep172,"THIS BEAUTIFUL HOUSE NOW BELONGS TO FRANCISCO AND MARIA, AND THEY WASTE NO TIME MOVING IN."
369,ep172,BEING IN THIS HOUSE FEELS GREAT.
370,ep172,"I THINK THIS HOUSE HAS EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR, EVERYTHING."
371,ep172,"(Francisco) WE WERE NOT THAT SURE ABOUT THE HOUSE, 'CAUSE WE JUST CAME BY, NOT REALLY THINKING THAT THIS WAS THE HOUSE."
372,ep172,"AND WHEN WE CAME UP HERE, WE SAID, WOW, THIS IS GREAT."
373,ep172,"(Suzanne) FRANCISCO AND MARIA FEEL FORTUNATE THAT THEIR CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH THAT NEWSPAPER AD HAS LED TO THIS, AN IDEAL NEW HOME."
374,ep172,"(Maria) IT HAS A YARD AND A VIEW, SO WE GET TO SEE THIS NICE VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS FROM ALMOST EVERY ROOM OF THE HOUSE."
375,ep172,EVEN FROM THE BATHROOM WE CAN SEE MOUNTAINS AND THE BLUE SKIES.
376,ep172,THE SUNSET IS SO GREAT.
377,ep172,THE SUNSET IS SO GREAT.
378,ep172,(Francisco) AND THE SUNRISES.
379,ep172,(Francisco) AND THE SUNRISES.
380,ep172,IT'S TOUGH THE FIRST NIGHT THAT YOU STAY AT THE HOUSE.
381,ep172,"YOU HAVE THAT FEAR OF WAKING UP NEXT MORNING AND FEELING OH, THIS IS THE WRONG HOUSE, AND YOU'RE ALREADY IN, AND YOU ALREADY DID THE WHOLE THING."
382,ep172,BUT THAT FEAR WENT AWAY WHEN WE SAW THE MAGNIFICENT SUNRISE.
383,ep172,"WE SEE RABBITS RUNNING, AND YOU SEE SQUIRRELS."
384,ep172,"I MEAN, IT'S REALLY A GREAT CONTACT WITH NATURE."
385,ep172,WE HAVE TO START HAVING A GARDENER.
386,ep172,THAT'S THE GOOD AND THE BAD THING.
387,ep172,"THE BAD THING IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE IT, YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IT."
388,ep172,"(Suzanne) DESPITE THE INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY, FRANCISCO AND MARIA LOVE THEIR NEW YARD AND THE WAY THE HOME'S DESIGN MAKES THE MOST OF IT."
389,ep172,(Francisco) WE SPEND A LOT MORE TIME INSIDE THE HOUSE.
390,ep172,THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO.
391,ep172,WE WANTED TO HAVE A SPACE THAT WE FEEL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT.
392,ep172,"THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY HAPPENS HERE, 'CAUSE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING AT HOME, AND WE DON'T FEEL THE NECESSITY OF GOING OUT."
393,ep172,WE JUST STAY HERE...
394,ep172,IF WE NEED A BREAK FROM WORK WE JUST TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN.
395,ep172,(Suzanne) GIANT WINDOWS WITH A BEAUTIFUL YARD JUST STEPS AWAY IS AN IDEAL COMBINATION FOR FRANCISCO AND MARIA.
396,ep172,I THINK THAT THE FIRST CLICK THAT WE KNEW THAT THIS COULD BE THE HOUSE IS WHEN YOU OPEN THE FRONT DOOR.
397,ep172,WHEN YOU OPEN THE FRONT DOOR IS YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION.
398,ep172,IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE.
399,ep172,"AND THE FIRST IMPRESSION WAS LIKE, WOW, BIG SPACE."
400,ep172,"AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR, THAT BIG SPACE."
401,ep172,"THE PUGLIESES WERE HAPPILY SURPRISED TO FIND EXACTLY THE KIND OF HOUSE THEY WANTED, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO COMPROMISE THEIR LOVE OF GOOD DESIGN TO GET THE SPACE THEY CRAVED."
402,ep172,FRANCISCO AND MARIA ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ENJOYING THEIR NEW HOME FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.
403,ep172,I'M SUZANNE WHANG...
404,ep172,THANKS FOR WATCHING.
